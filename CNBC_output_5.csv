Annika Kim Constantino,Shares of biotech startup Structure Therapeutics surge more than 30% on promising obesity pill data,"In this article
Shares of Structure Therapeutics
rose more than 30% on Friday after the biotech startup’s experimental obesity pill succeeded in a small early-stage trial. 
The once-daily drug helped overweight or obese participants reduce up to 10 pounds of weight on average after four weeks of treatment, according to a release from the company. Structure said it plans to test its pill in two longer midstage trials as a treatment for diabetes and obesity.
Structure’s pill is part of the same class of drugs as Novo Nordisk
’s blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and weight loss counterpart Wegovy. 
Those treatments, known as GLP-1s, have soared in popularity this year due to their ability to help patients lose unwanted pounds. GLP-1s mimic a hormone produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite. 
Companies like Structure are trying to capitalize on the booming obesity drug industry, which analysts say could be a $100 billion global market by the end of the decade. 
Structure’s pill could potentially compete with oral obesity drugs from Eli Lilly
, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer
, which are not approved in the U.S. yet. Analysts say the arrival of cheaper, more convenient pill versions of the GLP-1s could increase access for patients and expand the market for obesity drugs.
Pills are easier to manufacture than injections, making them less likely to run into the supply shortages plaguing injectable drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro. Pills are also typically cheaper than injections, though it’s unclear if that will be the case with the obesity treatments. 
Wegovy’s list price tops $1,300 per monthly package, and Ozempic’s is about $935. Novo Nordisk has a diabetes pill called Rybelsus, which has the same list price as Ozempic for a monthly package of 30 tablets."
Hugh Son,Citigroup CEO Fraser sees ‘cracks’ emerging among some consumers as savings ebb,"In this article
Lower-end consumers have shifted buying patterns to save money as their bank accounts dwindle in size, according to Citigroup
CEO Jane Fraser.
The third-largest U.S. bank by assets has been monitoring its credit card customers for signs of distress, Fraser told CNBC’s Sara Eisen on Friday in an interview.
“We are paying attention to the lower FICO consumer, where there are cracks” forming, Fraser said, referring to the widely used credit-scoring system from Fair Isaac Corp. “I think some of the excess savings from the Covid years are getting close to depletion.”
The U.S. government injected trillions of dollars into households and businesses during the pandemic to avert disaster, money that has helped keep the economy humming for longer than many forecasters expected. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s most aggressive interest rate hiking cycle in four decades has made credit card, mortgage and auto debt more expensive, and late payments and defaults have been climbing.
When asked what other CEOs are telling her about the state of the economy, Fraser said that besides comments on artificial intelligence and labor tightness, corporate leaders have told her that demand is softening, she said.
“Particularly [for] the bottom end of the consumer, that’s the one that we’re starting to see cracks, you’re seeing some shift in the buying patterns to lower categories in the spend,” Fraser said. “It’s a resilient consumer, but it’s a softer one.”
Softening demand may help the Fed in its battle with inflation, the CEO noted. While employment and gross domestic product figures suggest the economy will achieve a “soft landing,” if it does tip into recession, it will likely be a “manageable” one, Fraser said.
In the wide-ranging interview, Citi’s CEO also said her latest overhaul of the bank was a move away from the “financial supermarket” model of the past into a more streamlined operation.
The scope of job cuts and expense savings triggered by the reorganization will be disclosed with fourth quarter-earnings, she said."
Laya Neelakandan,Toys R Us is planning a brick-and-mortar comeback in the U.S.,"Toys R Us is plotting a bold comeback in the U.S., as it plans to expand its brick-and-mortar presence with as many as 24 new flagship stores and a separate rollout at airports and on cruise ships starting this holiday season.
The toy retailer’s parent company, WHP Global, announced what it called the “Air, Land and Sea” expansion on Friday. Toys R Us aims to start opening the up to two dozen flagship stores as early as next year in partnership with Go! Retail Group. The company plans to roll out the locations in “prime cities” that complement its current retail footprint, WHP said.
The first airport store is set to open in November, in time for the holiday season, in Terminal A of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the world’s second-busiest airport.
“The Toys R Us brand is growing fast and our expansion into air, land and sea is a testament to the brand’s strength,” said Yehuda Shmidman, chairman and CEO of WHP, in a statement.
The expansion plan continues a slow revival of the once ubiquitous brand.
Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in 2017, though it could not come out of it on its own, pushing it into liquidation. In January of that year, the company operated 1,691 stores and licensed 257 stores across 38 countries, according to an SEC filing. WHP acquired a controlling interest in Toys R Us’ parent company, Tru Kids, in 2021. The company planned to open more Toys R Us stores across the country, after the brand’s only two remaining locations in the U.S. closed earlier in 2021.
At the time, Shmidman said he hoped to open a combination of flagship, pop-up and airport stores as the country emerged into a post-Covid retail landscape. In summer 2021, WHP announced a rollout of more than 400 new Toys R Us stores at Macy’s
locations across the country.
In a Friday statement, Shmidman said the company has increased Toys R Us’ global footprint by more than 50% since the acquisition, with upward of 1,400 stores and e-commerce sites across 31 countries.
One of those stores is its current flagship two-level store at the American Dream megamall in New Jersey. The 20,000 square foot location includes experiences for kids such as a two-story slide, café and ice cream shop.
WHP told CNBC the new flagship stores will be modeled after the American Dream location with “immersive” shopping experiences. But the New Jersey store will likely remain the largest location.
The expansion also will bring stores to airports and cruise lines as the company looks to keep up with the rise of travel retail. The first-of-its-kind store at the Dallas airport, in a partnership with Duty Free Americas, will allow customers to shop for their favorite toys and regional merchandise before hopping on a flight, and the company also plans to offer a range of toys and cruise-themed merchandise for that industry.
The Toys R Us brand generates more than $2 billion in global retail sales annually, WHP said."
Annika Kim Constantino,"Drugmakers spent nearly $500 million on ads for obesity, diabetes drugs in 2023","In this article
Drugmakers spent nearly $500 million on advertisements for obesity and diabetes treatments in the U.S. during the first seven months of this year, up 20% from the same period a year ago, according to new data released Friday. 
The data, from advertising analytics firm MediaRadar, demonstrates the rush by companies to capture new customers after months of hype around Novo Nordisk
’s diabetes drug Ozempic and weight loss counterpart Wegovy. 
Those drugs and similar treatments have soared in demand this year for their ability to help patients lose unwanted pounds. The medicines, known as GLP-1s, mimic a hormone produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite. 
U.S. health-care providers wrote more than 9 million prescriptions for Ozempic, Wegovy, and other obesity and diabetes drugs during the last three months of 2022, up 300% from early 2020.
MediaRadar compiled ad spending from national TV broadcasts, print publications, newspapers and websites, and social media platforms from Jan. 1, 2022 to July 31, 2023. 
The top four drugs advertised were Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, Wegovy and diabetes pill Rybelsus and Boehringer Ingelheim’s own diabetes treatment Jardiance, which is set to face drug price negotiations with the federal Medicare program. 
Together, those treatments accounted for $358 million, or about three-quarters, of total ad spending for obesity and diabetes drugs during the first seven months of this year, according to the data. 
Spending on Ozempic ads was $120 million during that time period, up 23% from the same period last year.
MediaRadar said in a statement that Ozempic’s rise in popularity has had a “positive impact on similar medications.” 
“It’s a classic case of ‘a rising tide lifts all boats,’” MediaRadar CEO Todd Krizelman said in the statement. “As Ozempic’s popularity grows, so does the demand for other weight loss and diabetes drugs, especially Wegovy, which has made a significant mark this year, particularly from Q2 onwards.”
Wegovy accounted for more than $20 million in ad spending during the first seven months of the year, primarily due to a spike in spending from April to July, according to MediaRadar. 
But MediaRadar noted that Novo Nordisk in May paused some key promotional advertising for Wegovy, specifically local and national TV advertising. 
MediaRadar said most of the spending on the drug was for digital advertising, such as online video. "
Michael Wayland,Automakers grow frustrated over pace of UAW negotiations as new strike deadline looms,"In this article
DETROIT – Tensions are rising and accusations are flying between the Detroit automakers and United Auto Workers, as the union threatens to expand U.S. plant strikes – marking two weeks of work stoppages and the dwindling likelihood of an imminent breakthrough.
The UAW is expected to announce additional strike targets at 10 a.m. ET Friday, barring substantial progress in negotiations with General Motors,
Ford Motor
and Stellantis
for contracts covering some 146,000 autoworkers. UAW President Shawn Fain will host a Facebook Live event then to update members on the talks and identify additional strike locations, a source familiar with the talks said.
In the run-up, frustrations remain around key economic demands and what some see as a lack of urgency by the union to reach a deal, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private.
Specifically, GM and Stellantis have grown increasingly frustrated by a lack of participation from Fain and what they say are delays in receiving counterproposals from the union, some of those sources said.
The union set a new Friday deadline before holding any high-level meetings between Fain and the companies, the people said, raising questions about the union’s commitment to reaching a deal and ending the strikes. As of the Wednesday announcement, the UAW also hadn’t put forth counterproposals to offers made by the automakers roughly a week earlier, the people said.
The first high-level, “main table” talks between the union with Fain and the two automakers came only after that Wednesday announcement, in a late-afternoon meeting the same day with GM, without CEO Mary Barra, and a midday Thursday meeting with Stellantis, the sources said.
The union Thursday afternoon confirmed it submitted a counteroffer to Stellantis during the meeting – giving the company less than 24 hours to respond ahead of the fresh deadline.
The lack of urgency is increasingly frustrating company negotiators, many of whom are more accustomed to around-the-clock bargaining to get a deal as soon as possible, the sources said. Such talks have been few and far between as Fain attempts to negotiate with all three companies at once, they said.
Fain has consistently said the union is available to negotiate 24/7, however the automakers have questioned his availability and the union’s tactics broadly, particularly in light of leaked private messages in which the UAW’s communications director, Jonah Furman, described keeping the companies “wounded for months.”
A UAW spokesman declined to comment on the strategy, including on the union waiting a week to respond and giving Stellantis less than 24 hours to respond.
Concerns around the pace of talks follow similar claims by Fain and the union. Before initiating strikes on Sept. 15, Fain heavily criticized the automakers for failing to provide counteroffers to the union’s proposals, which were first delivered to the companies in early August.
All three automakers say they’ve made substantial offers to the union. The deals on the table include hourly wage increases of roughly 20%, thousands of dollars in bonuses and enhancements to the workers already-substantial benefits packages. Ford, for its part, has offered to reinstate prior cost-of-living adjustments to offset inflation.
But the UAW has demanded more, including 40% wage increases, an end to the “tier” system under which new hires spend several years working up to full wages, a 32-hour workweek, and benefits including additional time off and assurances about electric vehicles.
About 18,300 workers, or roughly 12.5% of the UAW members covered by its contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike.
In recent days, union members on the picket lines have reported confrontations, intimidation with guns, hit-and-run vehicle accidents, and vandalism of vehicles and company property.
Five people suffered minor injuries when they were hit by a vehicle that drove through the UAW’s picket line while leaving a GM parts facility in Flint, Michigan, on Wednesday. The vehicle was driven by a third-party contractor doing work for GM at the facility.
GM issued a statement saying that three contractors, including the driver, had been banned from its properties. It urged its other contractors and salaried employees to follow established safety procedures when crossing a UAW picket line.
Separately, Stellantis released a statement on Thursday accusing the UAW of mischaracterizing other incidents that did not – contrary to statements by Fain – involve replacement workers, or so-called scabs.
“Since the UAW expanded its strike to our parts distribution centers last Friday, we’ve witnessed an escalation of dangerous, and even violent, behavior by UAW picketers at several of those facilities, including slashing truck tires, jumping on vehicles, following people home and hurling racial slurs at dedicated Stellantis employees who are merely crossing the picket line to do their jobs,” the statement said.
The company said it has not hired any outside workers to replace striking UAW members: “Only current employees who are protecting our business and third parties making pick-ups and deliveries as they normally would are entering our facilities.”
The company called on Fain and other UAW leaders to help ensure the safety of all Stellantis employees, including those on the picket line."
Michael Sheetz,"Blue Origin, Sierra Space weigh future of Orbital Reef space station","The Orbital Reef space station partnership between Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Sierra Space is on rocky footing, CNBC has learned.
The companies announced Orbital Reef as a co-led project in 2021, but updates about the project dried up in the past year. The pair of private space companies are now navigating a potential end to the Orbital Reef partnership, according to three people who spoke to CNBC about the situation.
Those people, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic matters, emphasized that discussions are ongoing and described the situation as fluid. But other development projects with more significant current contracts – such as Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lunar lander and Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser spaceplane – have taken higher priority for both companies, those people said.
It’s becoming increasingly likely that Blue Origin and Sierra Space will go their separate ways, leaving behind joint efforts to develop Orbital Reef, according to those sources.
Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter.
Shortly after unveiling the Orbital Reef project, Blue Origin won a $130 million contract from NASA for design work on the private space station. That contract was one of three funded Space Act Agreements (SAA) that NASA issued for the first phase of its Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program.
Blue is the prime contractor under that NASA award, with Sierra as a subcontractor.
NASA spokesperson Rebecca Wickes told CNBC in a statement that the agency has so far paid Blue Origin $24 million of the total contract amount for completing specified milestones. As of yet “there are no current plans to transfer the agreement,” Wickes said.
Sierra did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment on Orbital Reef. Neither did Blue Origin, but the company, shortly after being reached by CNBC, posted on social media that it is making “progress on our Commercial Destinations Space Act Agreement with NASA.”
“Our team is currently testing window frames and materials in a relevant space environment,” Blue Origin said, without mentioning Orbital Reef by name.
Blue originally unveiled Orbital Reef alongside Sierra, envisioning a “mixed use business park” in space. The first major pieces of Orbital Reef were scheduled to launch in 2027, with the companies aiming to begin service around the time the International Space Station retires near the end of the decade.
Habitable space stations have long been an interest for Blue Origin, with Bezos’ vision for the company to create a future where “millions of people are living and working in space to benefit Earth.” Similarly, Sierra has been developing an habitat concept for years, known as LIFE (“Large Integrated Flexible Environment”).
Several companies are also working to build private space stations, with competing projects being led by Axiom, Voyager Space, Northrop Grumman
and Vast.
The Orbital Reef team also includes Boeing
, Redwire
, Amazon
, Genesis Engineering Solutions, and Arizona State University underneath Blue and Sierra.
Orbital Reef is not seen as a top priority for either company, according to three people familiar with the companies. Two of those sources pointed CNBC to a shift in Blue Origin’s interests after the company won a $3.4 billion NASA contract to build a crew lunar lander – noting its space station and lunar lander programs compete for resources in the same business unit.
Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith is leaving at the end of the year and new leader Dave Limp will need to execute on other major projects – including its New Shepard and New Glenn rockets, as well as its BE-4 engine production.
Similarly, much of Sierra’s resources are devoted to getting the initial cargo variation of its reusable Dream Chaser spaceplane flying. It has been developing Dream Chaser for more than a decade, under contract to fly cargo for NASA to the International Space Station.
The company earlier this week raised $290 million in new funding and hopes to fly Dream Chaser to the ISS for the first time next year.
There have been signs the Orbital Reef project was unraveling: The website for the project, created jointly by Blue and Sierra, hasn’t published an update on the station’s development in more than a year. As of Thursday, neither company’s careers websites have job openings that mention “Orbital Reef,” despite having dozens of listings mention the project in the past. And Sierra Space dropped references to Orbital Reef in its most recent press releases, focusing solely on its own habitat work.
From NASA’s viewpoint, changes to the structure or involvement of different companies in the first phase of a project like this one are not surprising. For example, Northrop Grumman didn’t rejoin Blue Origin’s team when the company bid a second time for a crew lunar lander. And, more relevant to the CLD program, another space station project called Starlab saw Airbus take the place of Lockheed Martin as the core habitat’s builder.
For its part, Sierra has continued to test and develop LIFE – an inflatable module that made up a major part of the Orbital Reef architecture. Sierra has regularly posted updates about milestones in testing habitats, such as a recent “burst” testing of a sub-scale prototype. Last month, Sierra announced plans to launch a “pathfinder” demonstration mission of its LIFE (Large Integrated Flexible Environment) habitat in 2026."
Melissa Repko,"GameStop’s survival demands ‘extreme frugality,’ CEO Ryan Cohen tells employees","In this article
Just hours after being named GameStop
’s CEO, Ryan Cohen sent out a memo to employees Thursday that emphasized he will take dramatic steps to ensure the struggling video game retailer survives.
“Our job is to make sure GameStop is here for decades to come,” he wrote in the email that was sent to corporate employees and store leaders and obtained by CNBC. “Extreme frugality is required. Every expense at the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated. The company has no use for delegators and money wasters. I expect everyone to treat company money like their own and lead by example.”
Cohen, a billionaire activist investor and founder of direct-to-consumer pet food and supply retailer Chewy
, was named the company’s new leader Thursday morning. He was previously executive chair of GameStop. As of late June, his firm RC Ventures was the company’s largest shareholder with a 12.09% stake, according to FactSet.
Cohen’s CEO announcement previewed the company’s emphasis on slashing costs: He will not receive a salary in his new role.
Cohen became an integral part of the “meme stock” frenzy, as he invested in companies including now bankrupt Bed Bath & Beyond. He joined GameStop’s board in 2021 in the thick of the phenomenon.
Cohen’s new role kicks off the latest chapter of GameStop’s effort to reinvent itself. The Grapevine, Texas-based retailer, which was founded in the 1980s, built its business on selling video games, consoles and other gaming merchandise.
Yet as customers buy video games online, it has fallen from relevance and had to chase new ways make money. It has experimented with new businesses, such as launching an NFT marketplace and striking a partnership with now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
The company has also dealt with major leadership changes. With Cohen on its board, GameStop tapped multiple Amazon veterans, including Matt Furlong, who became CEO, and Mike Recupero, who became chief financial officer.
Yet GameStop fired both of those leaders. Cohen got the top job nearly four months after the company ousted Furlong.
GameStop shares closed at $16.84 on Thursday and have fallen nearly 9% this year. The closing price was less than a quarter of its all-time high close of more than $86 a share in January 2021.
Earlier this month, GameStop reported a second-quarter net loss of $2.8 million, compared to a $108.7 million loss in the prior-year period.
--
Read the full memo below:
Subject: Survival
 
I will be straight to the point.
 
It is not sustainable for GameStop to operate a money losing business. The mission is to operate hyper efficiently and profitably. Our expense structure must allow us to endure any adverse scenario. Whether it’s a difficult economy or revenue deceleration from shrinking software, we must be profitable. Our job is to make sure GameStop is here for decades to come. Extreme frugality is required. Every expense at the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated. The company has no use for delegators and money wasters. I expect everyone to treat company money like their own and lead by example.
 
Prospering in retail means survival. If we survive, we stay in the game. Survival is avoiding the deadly sins that often lead retailers to self-destruct. This is usually a result of the following - buying bad inventory, using leverage, and running expenses too high. By avoiding these self-inflicted mistakes and focusing on the basics, GameStop can be here for a long time.
 
I expect everyone to roll up their sleeves and work hard. I’m not getting paid, so I’m either going down with the ship or turning the company around. I much prefer the latter.
 
It won’t be easy. Best of luck to us all.

Lillian Rizzo,"Endeavor, Fenway Sports consider investment in the PGA Tour","In this article
The PGA Tour is attracting potential outside investors — some of which are considering making a rival pitch to the Saudi-backed Public Investment Fund’s proposal, according to people familiar with the matter.
Endeavor Group Holdings
and Fenway Sports Group are considering investing in the PGA Tour, potentially to rival or coincide with the PIF’s proposed deal, said the people, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the discussions.
The discussions, which are in preliminary stages, stem from a PGA Tour investment vehicle created as part of the framework agreement for its proposed deal with PIF.
“Throughout 2023, the PGA Tour has demonstrated its strength, reach and value as an enterprise. Our focus continues to be on finalizing an agreement with the Public Investment Fund and the DP World Tour, however, our negotiations have resulted in unsolicited interest from other investors,” said a PGA Tour spokesperson.
Representatives for Endeavor and Fenway declined to comment.
Bloomberg earlier reported that Endeavor and Fenway were mulling a rival offer.
In June, the PGA Tour announced a proposed deal that would see it combine with rival LIV Golf following months of lawsuits and competition between the two. The PIF, which is controlled by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, finances LIV.
Under the framework agreement, the tour would hold a permanent controlling interest in the new entity’s board of directors and would maintain that majority share regardless of PIF’s investments. PIF has said it would invest billions into the entity and hold a noncontrolling minority stake.
Specifics of the deal and its valuation are still being discussed. The tour’s board, including player directors, have to sign off on an eventual definitive agreement. Ultimately, the tour and its members will make the decision on the final investment structure, and whether it includes or is led by PIF or alternative investors, one of the people said.
The deal between LIV and the PGA Tour has faced criticism and controversy. It is currently under investigation by a Senate subcommittee. The Saudis have been accused of “sportswashing” to take the focus off the kingdom’s history of human rights violations.
Endeavor recently was behind the combination of its UFC and World Wrestling Entertainment, a newly merged publicly traded company now called TKO
. Fenway is an investment firm that backs several major sports franchises, including Major League Baseball’s Boston Red Sox, the Liverpool Football Club and the National Hockey League’s Pittsburgh Penguins."
Gabrielle Fonrouge,Nike misses revenue expectations for the first time in two years,"In this article
Nike
reported revenue Thursday that fell short of Wall Street’s sales expectations for the first time in two years, but it beat on earnings and gross margin estimates, sending its stock soaring in after-hours trading.
Here’s how the sneaker giant performed during its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended August 31 was $1.45 billion, or 94 cents per share, compared with $1.47 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.
Sales rose to $12.94 billion, up about 2% from $12.69 billion a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter was just shy of the $12.98 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG.
Nike shares rose about 8% in extended trading Thursday.
The retailer maintained its full-year guidance of revenue growth in the mid-single digits and gross margin expansion of 1.4 to 1.6 percentage points.
“We’re closely monitoring the operating environment, including foreign currency exchange rates, consumer demand over the holiday season, and our second half wholesale order book,” said finance chief Matthew Friend on a call with analysts.
“We are cautiously planning for modest markdown improvements for the balance of the year, given the promotional environment,” he added.
For the second quarter, Nike expects revenue growth to be up slightly versus the prior year and gross margins to grow by about 1 percentage point versus the prior year.
Investors have been laser focused on Nike’s recovery in China, its relationship with its wholesale partners and how the resumption of student loan payments will impact sales. 
They’re also keen to see Nike’s margins recover after bloated inventories, high promotions and supply chain woes contributed to lower profits over the last few quarters. 
During the quarter, Nike’s gross margin fell about 0.1 percentage points to 44.2%, but it was higher than the 43.7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. The company attributed the gross margin drop to higher product costs and currency exchange rates, but those trends were offset by price increases, which contributed to the earnings beat.
Sales in China grew by 5% compared to the year-ago period to $1.7 billion, which fell short of the $1.8 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.
During the previous quarter ended May 31, Nike saw China sales jump 16% compared to the year-ago period. But the numbers were against easy comparisons because the region was still under Covid-related lockdown orders during the prior year. 
While Nike remains bullish on China, the region’s economic recovery has so far been a mixed bag. Following a sluggish July, retail sales picked up during the month of August to rise 4.6% compared to the prior year, beating expectations of a 3% growth forecast by Reuters. 
“We feel good about the market there and our position,” said CEO John Donahoe, adding he’s traveled to China twice in the last four months. “Frankly, a couple things stand out. One, sport is back in China, you can just feel it, and that gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment, regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there.”
Nike saw sales jumps in every region besides North America, its largest market by revenue. Sales in North America fell 2% from the year-ago period to $5.42 billion, just above the $5.39 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales were up 8% at $3.61 billion. That compared with the $3.51 billion analysts had expected. Sales in its Latin America and Asia Pacific unit came in 2% higher at $1.57 billion, just shy of the $1.59 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.
The Converse brand, on the other hand, fell well short of expectations for a second quarter in a row. Sales came in at $588 million, down 9% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts had expected sales to be about $660 million, according to StreetAccount.
Nike’s direct channel, which includes its owned stores and its digital channel, led the retailer’s growth during the quarter and was up 6% compared to the prior year. In June, the company noticed that shoppers were shifting towards its stores over its digital channels, signaling consumers are getting closer to pre-pandemic shopping habits.
“We continue to see that consumers want to connect directly and personally with our brands and in fact, member engagement within our direct business is up double digits versus the prior year with increasing average order values,” said Friend.
“Our stores delivered an especially strong quarter with traffic up double digits from last year, and members driving an increasing share of our business as consumers shifted from our digital to physical channels... Our team was nimble in transitioning inventory to capture higher full-price sales across our entire store fleet,” he said.
When it comes to its wholesale revenues, Nike’s relationship with those partners have been rocky. As the company has pivoted to a direct-to-consumer model, it has focused on driving sales online and in its stores at the expense of its wholesale accounts. 
However, as Nike grappled with excess inventories throughout 2023, it relied on those partners to move through that merchandise. It has now restored its relationship with both Macy’s
and DSW
– accounts that it previously cut in favor of its DTC strategy. 
Some analysts expected Nike’s wholesale revenue to be sluggish during the quarter because excess inventories have been a problem throughout the retail industry – and some wholesalers are being more particular in what they order to avoid another backlog. 
Wholesale revenue during the quarter was flat compared to the year-ago period at $7 billion.
Both Donahoe and Friend made it clear to analysts that Nike is ready to meet customers in all channels — including through wholesalers and directly. The retailer shouted out Dick’s Sporting Goods
as one of its key partners and noted that it’s still in the process of resetting its business with Footlocker
, which has seen two quarters in a row of plunging sales and profits.
Despite the shift in how it’s working with wholesalers, Nike insisted that direct sales will pave the way to its future growth.
“Ultimately, we have a segmented portfolio of strong partners across price points and channels. With no single partner representing more than a mid-single digit of Nike’s total business,” said Friend.
“While the ultimate landing spot of digital and direct isn’t as clear, we do believe we’re going to be a more direct and a more digital company, and a more profitable company,” he said. “And there’s a channel mix and channel profitability opportunity that comes with that as well.”
Meanwhile, inventories fell 10% to $8.7 billion. The drop was driven by a decrease in units but offset by product mix and higher manufacturing and production costs.
“On the whole, we’re very comfortable with the level of inventory in the marketplace in relation to the retail sales that we’re seeing as we begin increasing levels of wholesale sell in our second half,” said Friend.
Amid decades-high inflation rates, consumers have been pulling back on apparel and footwear. With the resumption of student loan payments looming ahead, some analysts expect those sectors to take an even greater hit. 
Jefferies conducted a survey on U.S. consumer spending and found 54% of respondents plan to spend less on apparel and accessories. Meanwhile, 46% plan to spend less on footwear, which doesn’t bode well for Nike. 
It’s still too early to gauge the impact of student loan payments on Nike. Its first quarter ended in late August, and payments aren’t set to resume until October.
During the quarter, footwear sales rose 4% to $8.4 billion, making up about 68% of Nike’s total sales. Apparel was down 1% at $3.4 billion.
Correction: Nike’s gross margin fell 0.1 percentage points. An earlier version of this story misstated that figure."
Drew Richardson,NFL tells X it’s concerned about placement of ads on white nationalist accounts,"The National Football League on Thursday responded to a recent report that pointed out its ads were placed on white nationalist feeds on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, formerly known as Twitter.
“NFL unequivocally denounces any form of hate speech and has absolutely no association with these individuals or any group that promotes racism,” NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy told NBC Sports’ Pro Football Talk. “As soon as this was brought to our attention, we immediately expressed our concerns to X to understand and rectify the issue.”
The NFL did not indicate if it would pull ads from the platform, or if X would remove the ads from the white nationalist accounts. X’s press relations email responded with an automated response when CNBC asked for comment: “Busy now, please check back later.”
Left-leaning media watchdog site MediaMatters.org first reported on the ad placements Wednesday. X shares a portion of ad revenue to owners of eligible accounts in which ads appear, if the owner opts in. Media Matters found five white nationalist accounts, with a total of one million followers, where NFL ads appeared.
Since Musk bought the social media company last year, watchdog groups have criticized the company for failing to monitor and remove hate speech.
X has fought back, suing the Center for Countering Digital Hate during the summer, arguing the group illegally accessed company data to claim that harmful content overwhelmed the platform. Earlier this month, the CCDH released a new report saying X continuously fails to remove hate speech and other harmful content from the platform despite being notified the content violated the platform’s hateful conduct guidelines.
The NFL’s statement Thursday comes days after Brian Rolapp, the NFL’s chief media and business officer, praised X and its CEO, Linda Yaccarino. “They are doing great work innovating to make the platform better for @NFLfans and partners,” he posted on the platform.
Yaccarino struggled to answer key questions regarding company matters, including hate speech and antisemitism, at Vox Media’s 2023 Code Conference on Wednesday. When asked about complaints regarding antisemitism on the platform, Yaccarino responded, “Everybody deserves to speak their opinion.”"
Gabrielle Fonrouge,"GameStop names Ryan Cohen as CEO effective immediately, won’t receive salary","In this article
GameStop
said Thursday morning that billionaire activist investor Ryan Cohen would take over as the video game retailer’s chief executive, chairman and president effective immediately — and he won’t be collecting a salary.
Shares of the company fell 1.8%.
GameStop’s board, with Cohen abstaining, unanimously voted to appoint the entrepreneur as the retailer’s top executive on Wednesday. Cohen had previously held the title of executive chairman but will step down from the role upon his latest appointment, according to a securities filing.
Cohen won’t “receive any compensation” for his work, a news release said.
The move comes more than three months after GameStop fired CEO Matthew Furlong, made Cohen executive chairman and appointed longtime company soldier Mark Robinson as its “principal executive officer” and general manager. GameStop didn’t give a reason for Furlong’s dismissal at the time, but it came just months after the company had reported its first quarterly profit in two years with Furlong at the helm.
Several weeks later, the company announced that CFO Diana Saadeh-Jajeh was resigning.
With the latest move, Cohen will also assume the role of principal executive officer from Robinson. He previously served as general counsel and secretary, and he added principal executive officer to his list of duties back in June. Now, he will resume as just general counsel and secretary, according to a securities filing.
Cohen, who founded pet food retailer Chewy
and has become known as the “king” of meme stocks, bought a stake in GameStop in 2020 and joined the board in 2021 – during the height of the meme phenomenon.
As of late June, his firm RC Ventures was GameStop’s largest shareholder with a 12.09% stake, according to FactSet.
Since Cohen joined the company, the business hasn’t shown many signs of a turnaround, albeit with some exceptions. Earlier this month, GameStop reported its second-quarter financial results, posting a narrower loss than it did a year ago, as well as a slight increase in revenue.

Michael Sheetz,SpaceX wins first Pentagon contract for Starshield military satellite network,"The Pentagon has awarded Elon Musk’s SpaceX its first confirmed contract for the Starshield network it’s developing, a military-specific version of the company’s Starlink satellite internet system, the defense agency said Wednesday.
A Space Force spokesperson confirmed that SpaceX on Sept. 1 was awarded a one-year contract for Starshield with a maximum value of $70 million. The award came alongside 18 other companies through a program run by the Space Force’s commercial satellite communications office.
“The SpaceX contract provides for Starshield end-to-end service (via the Starlink constellation), user terminals, ancillary equipment, network management and other related services,” Space Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek told CNBC.
SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on the Starshield contract.
The company unveiled Starshield last year as a new business line. The Pentagon is already a high-value buyer of the company’s rocket launches and had shown increasing interest in its Starlink satellite internet.
SpaceX has given few details about the intended scope and capabilities of Starshield. It markets the service as the center of an “end-to-end,” dedicated offering for national security with capabilities distinct from its Starlink consumer and enterprise network.

SpaceX’s award for Starshield follows its June win of a Pentagon contract to buy an undefined number of Starlink ground terminals for use in Ukraine.
The initial phase of the Starshield contract obligates $15 million to SpaceX by Sept. 30, to provide services that support 54 military “mission partners” across Department of Defense branches, the spokesperson said.
Bloomberg first reported the contract on Thursday.

Leslie Josephs,"Delta CEO says carrier went ‘too far’ in SkyMiles changes, promises modifications after frequent flyer backlash","In this article
Delta Air Lines
CEO Ed Bastian said the airline will make “modifications” in the next few weeks to its loyalty program after a recently announced overhaul that would make it more expensive for many travelers to earn elite status and get into airport lounges was met with a backlash from customers.
“No question we probably went too far,” Bastian said at the Rotary Club of Atlanta on Monday.
The program changes, which Delta unveiled earlier this month, would reward customers with elite status based on how much they spent, a model similar to that of American Airlines
, and reduce access to Delta popular airport Sky Club lounges for many American Express
cardholders.
JetBlue Airways
tried to capitalize on some customers’ anger over Delta’s changes by offering frequent flyer status matching, saying, “we’ve made it easy for you to cozy up to a new loyalty program and see where it goes.”
Delta has been grappling with a surge in elite travelers, bolstered by Covid pandemic and post-pandemic spending, and swarms of travelers trying to get into its lounges, leading to long lines for many customers. The airline and rivals including American and United
have been racing to build bigger airport lounges to cater to swelling numbers of big spenders.
Bastian said the airline will announce the updated program changes in the coming weeks. Spokespeople for both Delta and American Express said they had no further comments on the changes.
“It’s gotten to the point, honestly, where we have so much demand for our premium product and services that are far in excess of our ability to serve it effectively in terms of our assets,” Bastian said.
He said that over the Covid-19 pandemic, the airline doubled the number of Diamond Medallion status members.
David Neeleman, founder and CEO of Breeze Airways and founder of JetBlue, told CNBC on Wednesday that he has Delta Diamond Medallion status and that he tries to use Delta’s airport lounges but that sometimes “there’s a big line and it’s not worth it.”
Delta last year announced several changes to crack down on overcrowding at the clubs, such as barring employees from using them when flying standby with company travel privileges, even if they had qualifying credit cards. The Atlanta-based carrier also raised prices for club memberships for regular customers.
“If everyone’s special, no one feels special,’” Bastian said in an interview with CNBC last December."
Elliot Smith,Saudi soccer league says big-money player purchases are only the first step,"The big-spending Saudi Pro League is aiming to build its global broadcasting presence and become one of the top 10 soccer leagues in the world, its chief operating officer, Carlo Nohra, told CNBC on Thursday.
The league dominated the sports headlines over the summer as Saudi clubs cumulatively spent more than $1 billion in transfer fees and attracted some of the biggest names from Europe’s top leagues with mammoth contract offers.
Brazilian superstar Neymar and Senegalese forward Sadio Mane followed the previous arrivals of former Ballon D’Or winners Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, along with a host of other stars from the English Premier League, Spain’s La Liga, Germany’s Bundesliga, Italy’s Serie A and France’s Ligue 1.
Speaking to CNBC at the APOS conference in Bali, Indonesia, on Thursday, Nohra said that Saudi Arabia’s strategy is “extremely long term,” but that the acquisition of players was the first step.
“While that helps us grow on the pitch, the idea is to grow off the pitch and to commercialize as well, so the strategy takes in every element that we need to focus on to get the Saudi Pro League to where it aspires to be among the top 10 leagues in the world,” he said.
The kingdom’s massive investment in sport is part of a broader effort to diversify its economy away from oil by investing in commercial infrastructure to become a tourism, leisure and entertainment powerhouse.
It is also being used to bolster the country’s global reputation, with critics arguing that the ultimate aim of Saudi Arabia’s investment in soccer, golf, boxing, motor racing, and many other sport and entertainment ventures is to distract from its dismal human rights record.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a recent interview with Fox News, embraced accusations of “sportswashing” and said he did not care about the criticism, so long as the massive sporting investments ultimately yielded a positive contribution to Saudi GDP growth.
Nohra explained that the objectives handed down to the Saudi Pro League’s bosses were to firstly improve on-pitch performance through the acquisition of world-class players, to fill the country’s stadia and ultimately to drive the commercialization of the vastly improved overall product.
“We had a long, hard look at ourselves, we’ve discovered that we need to improve the governance of the league, we need to improve the product itself and the commercialization of that product, better understanding of our fans,” he said.
“The player acquisition presented some issues that needed to be addressed, the clubs’ capabilities needed to improve so we’ve looked at that as well, and equally how we’re organized as a league in order to compete at the global level.”
Along with the domestic revenues the government is hoping to generate through in-person match attendance, capitalizing on Saudi Arabia’s young population’s love of the sport, Nohra also said the Saudi Pro League was looking to expand its broadcast presence around the world.
“Since the introduction of Cristiano Ronaldo into the league in January, we’ve seen global distribution expand to unprecedented levels for Saudi soccer, and through the acquisitions this summer, we’ve had renewals across the board with now the needle moving on the commercialization of those rights across the world,” he said.
“So we’re delighted with where we are at the moment but we still need to continue to deliver for fans across the world what they now wish to have from Saudi football.”"
Michael Sheetz,"FAA closes Blue Origin rocket failure probe, requires 21 ‘corrective actions’","The Federal Aviation Administration closed its investigation into last year’s failed flight of a cargo mission by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, the regulator announced Wednesday.
Blue Origin is required by the FAA to “implement 21 corrective actions,” the regulator said in a statement. The FAA noted that Blue Origin will not be clear to launch New Shepard until after Blue Origin implements “all corrective actions that impact public safety” and receives an updated launch license.
“We’ve received the FAA’s letter and plan to fly soon,” a Blue Origin spokesperson said in a statement.
The 21 required actions include the “redesign of engine and nozzle components to improve structural performance during operation as well as organizational changes.” The FAA did not comment further on specifics of the corrections.
In September 2022, the company’s New Shepard rocket was flying a cargo mission when it suffered a failure. Earlier this year, Blue Origin said the source of the issue was an overheated part in the rocket engine’s nozzle. No people were onboard, as the NS-23 mission was carrying science and research payloads.
Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter.
Blue Origin said its investigation found that NS-23 flight’s engine failure was due to “operational temperatures that exceeded the expected and analyzed values of the nozzle material.” The company recovered fragments of the BE-3PM engine’s nozzle, finding “clear evidence of thermal damage and hot streaks resulting from increased operating temperatures.”
The New Shepard rocket launches from Blue Origin’s private facility in West Texas, carrying people and payloads above 100 kilometers, or more than 340,000 feet, for a couple minutes of weightlessness. The capsule is flown autonomously, with no human pilot, and floats down with the assistance of a set of parachutes to land in the Texas desert. The New Shepard rocket booster is reusable, returning to land on a concrete pad near the launch site.
To date, Blue Origin has flown 31 people past the edge of space with New Shepard.
Blue Origin has said since March that it expects to return New Shepard to flight “soon.” The crucial re-flight of the rocket is planned to carry the same research payloads that didn’t make it to space on the NS-23 mission, without crew."
Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Peloton shares soar on digital content, apparel partnership with Lululemon","In this article
Peloton
and Lululemon
are joining forces.
The two companies announced a five-year partnership Wednesday that will bring Peloton’s content to Lululemon’s exercise app. Lululemon in turn will become Peloton’s primary athletic apparel partner, and a select number of Peloton’s instructors will become ambassadors for the apparel retailer.
The terms of the deal, and whether the two companies will share revenue, were not disclosed.
Peloton’s stock jumped more than 15% in extended trading on the news. Shares of Lululemon — which has a roughly $48 billion market cap compared to Peloton’s $1.7 billion — were flat in after-hours trading.
As part of the announcement, Lululemon said it plans to stop selling Mirror, which allows users to stream workout classes, by the end of the year.
The company had been exploring a sale of the product after sales had come in below expectations and Lululemon was forced to take a $443 million impairment charge related to the equipment, the company said earlier this year.
Peloton’s content will now be accessible through Mirror, it told CNBC, but the fate of the Mirror device and whether the division will be sold off remains unclear.
Meanwhile, sales for Peloton’s connected fitness products have steadily fallen from their pandemic-era highs, so the company has zeroed in on content as its primary value proposition.
Its partnership with Lululemon will mark the first time Peloton has shared that prized content with another company, aside from a smaller partnership with Delta Air Lines that offers meditation and movement classes for fliers.
Lululemon’s app has about 13 million members, nearly double Peloton’s total global member count of nearly seven million. Under the agreement with Lululemon, Peloton will not have access to the members that are consuming its content.
The news comes one day after Peloton announced co-founder and Chief Product Officer Tom Cortese is leaving the company.
In May, CNBC spoke with Cortese and Peloton’s Chief Content Officer Jennifer Cotter about the company’s rebranding strategy and if it has any plans to partner with other businesses to offer its content.
Cotter, the brains behind Peloton’s content machine, said “nothing’s ever off the table” but said “there’s no real need” for such a partnership.
Cortese, for his part, made it clear partnerships weren’t on the horizon — at least in the short term.
“That’s not going to happen,” Cortese replied.
“One thing that has worked very well for Peloton in the past and will continue to work very well for Peloton going forward is our direct relationship with our members. We’re not going to lose our direct relationship with our members,” he continued. “It’s part of how we build community and how we build our business. There is no reason for us to have an intermediary between us and our members.”
Cortese couldn’t be immediately reached for comment following news of the partnership."
Michael Wayland,UAW again threatens to expand strikes if progress isn’t made by Friday,"In this article
DETROIT — The United Auto Workers union will announce expanded strikes at General Motors
, Ford Motor
and Stellantis
plants if the sides don’t make significant progress in negotiations by 10 a.m. ET Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The new union-imposed deadline comes a week after the UAW announced it would expand its initial Sept. 15 strikes at assembly plants of each of the Detroit automakers to 38 additional parts and distribution locations for GM and Stellantis. The UAW did not expand its strikes at Ford
, citing progress in those talks.
Like a week earlier, it’s expected that UAW President Shawn Fain will host a Facebook Live event to announce which plants will walk out at noon Friday, barring progress in the talks.
The strikes currently involve about 18,300 workers, or 12.5% of the UAW’s 146,000 members whose labor contracts expired on Sept. 14.
Fain previously said the union planned to increase the work stoppages, based on how negotiations with the companies were going. The union is calling the work stoppages “stand-up strikes,” a nod to historic “sit-down” strikes by the UAW in the 1930s.
Spokespeople for the Detroit automakers did not immediately respond for comment on Wednesday.
The additional strike plans come despite record contract offers from the automakers that include roughly 20% hourly wage increases, thousands of dollars in bonuses, retention of the union’s platinum health care and other sweetened benefits.
The union’s new deadline comes a day after President Joe Biden joined Fain and union members, becoming the first known sitting president to walk a picket line with striking autoworkers. Biden also voiced support for the union and its demands, including a 40% wage increase during the life of the contract.
The UAW has further demanded a shortened workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, the elimination of compensation tiers and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, among other improvements.
Unlike past strikes, UAW leaders opted for targeted strikes at select plants instead of initiating national walkouts.
The strategy is in an effort to keep the automakers on edge in an effort to pit them against one another to achieve better contracts, according to private messages leaked last week involving UAW communications director Jonah Furman.
The messages, which described a strategy to cause “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” for the companies, were heavily criticized by the automakers."
Annika Kim Constantino,"Merck, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers to engage in Medicare drug price negotiations","In this article
Merck
, AstraZeneca
, Bristol Myers Squibb
and Boehringer Ingelheim on Wednesday told CNBC they will agree to participate in the first round of Medicare drug price negotiations, even after all four drugmakers sued to halt the process last month.
Merck’s Type 2 diabetes drug Januvia, AstraZeneca’s own diabetes drug Farxiga, Boehringer Ingelheim’s diabetes drug Jardiance and Bristol Myers Squibb’s blood thinner Eliquis are among the first 10 drugs selected for price talks with Medicare. 
The four companies appear to be the first manufacturers to indicate that they will comply with the negotiations, which seek to rein in the rising costs of prescription drugs for older Americans. 
Manufacturers of the other six drugs selected have until Oct. 1 to sign an agreement to participate in the process. Those companies did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment about their intentions.
A spokesperson for Merck said in a statement that the company will sign the agreement to participate “under protest,” noting that it disagrees on “both legal and policy grounds” with the negotiations.
But “withdrawing all of the company’s products from Medicare and Medicaid would have devastating consequences for the millions of Americans who rely on our innovative medicines, and it is not tenable for any manufacturer to abandon nearly half of the U.S. prescription drug market,” the spokesperson said. “The choice between doing so and weathering the [Inflation Reduction Act’s] massive fines and taxes is no choice at all.”
If drugmakers decline to engage in the negotiations, they could be forced to pay an excise tax of up to 95% of their medication’s U.S. sales or to pull all of their products from the Medicare and Medicaid markets, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
A spokesperson for Bristol Myers Squibb similarly said the company has “no choice other than to sign the ‘agreement’” due to the penalties outlined by CMS.
An AstraZeneca spokesperson said the company remains “committed to ensuring patients have access to FARXIGA and plan to participate in the process outlined by CMS to communicate the value of FARXIGA to people covered by Medicare.”
Boehringer Ingelheim, which is privately held, said in a statement it is “committed to engaging in open and transparent conversations” with CMS.
Merck, Bristol Myers, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim and other drugmakers like Johnson & Johnson
have filed at least eight separate lawsuits in recent months seeking to declare the negotiations unconstitutional. Another lawsuit from the Chamber of Commerce, one of the biggest lobbying groups nationwide, is seeking a preliminary injunction, which aims to block the negotiations before Oct. 1. 
The pharmaceutical industry fiercely opposes the process because it believes it will threaten its revenue growth, profits and drug innovation. However, analysts expect minimal financial losses for companies, at least initially, since most of the drugs selected already face upcoming patent expirations that will likely weigh on revenue.
For example, Farxiga will lose its market exclusivity in 2026, which will open up the market to generic alternatives. That’s the same year renegotiated prices are set to take effect.
The Inflation Reduction Act, which narrowly passed Congress last year along party lines, empowered Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time in the program’s six-decade history. The law is the central pillar in the Biden administration’s efforts to control rising drug prices and was a major victory for the Democratic Party.
The administration named the first round of drugs set to face price talks last month, kicking off a lengthy negotiation process that will end in August 2024."
Stefan Sykes,Landmark marijuana financing bill clears big hurdle in the Senate,"A new bill that aims to give the marijuana industry access to banking services moved forward in the Senate on Wednesday.
The Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation Banking Act was introduced by a bipartisan group of senators last week. The bill would provide legal protection to banks or other financial institutions that offer services to state-legal marijuana businesses.
The Senate Banking Committee voted 14-9 to advance the measure to the full chamber’s floor.
Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat and lead sponsor of the bill, called its passage a “historic moment” and an “example of significant bipartisan cooperation.”
“Forcing legal businesses to operate in all-cash is dangerous for our communities; it’s an open invitation to robberies, muggings, money laundering, and organized crime—and the only people benefiting from the current system are criminals,” said Merkley in statement.
“I am committed to building bipartisan momentum to finally get a bill signed into law that ends the cannabis cash economy and improves public safety across the nation,” he added.
The bill is also being led by Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.; and Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., as well as Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
“This legislation will help make our communities and small businesses safer by giving legal cannabis businesses access to traditional financial institutions, including bank accounts and small business loans,” the senators said in a joint statement last week.
“It also prevents federal bank regulators from ordering a bank or credit union to close an account based on reputational risk,” they added.
Even as 39 states have legalized marijuana for recreational or medical use, the sector has struggled to scale. Marijuana’s classification as a Schedule I substance, or one with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, along with federal prohibition, pose a risk to banking institutions. This, in turn, has limited access to financing and a broader market.
Moreover, without access to financial services, state-legal cannabis businesses are forced to operate their businesses solely using cash, which can result in robbery, money laundering and organized crime.
Due to the opening of new adult-use markets in individual states, combined U.S. medical and recreational cannabis sales are expected to reach $33.6 billion by the end of 2023, according to analysis from the MJBiz Factbook from industry news outlet MJBizDaily.
The landmark vote Wednesday marked the first time the Senate has considered the legislation. An earlier version of the bill, the SAFE Banking Act, passed in the House seven times previously but has never advanced through the Senate under both Democratic and Republican control. Late last year, lawmakers excluded it from a $1.7 trillion government funding bill.
The bill may face a tougher path to passage if it ends up before the GOP-controlled House.
“I think it probably passes the banking committee, but I think it doesn’t go anywhere in the House,” said Ian Katz, an analyst with Capital Alpha Partners who covers banking and financials.
“Republicans seem to be souring on it,” he added.
The new bill includes stricter requirements for federal regulators, such as prohibiting them from terminating any marijuana-related accounts without “valid reason,” or from denying banking services based on “personal beliefs or political motivations.”"
Annika Kim Constantino,"Ozempic, Wegovy drug prescriptions hit 9 million, surge 300% in under three years","In this article
U.S. health care providers wrote more than nine million prescriptions for Ozempic, Wegovy and similar diabetes and obesity drugs during the last three months of 2022, according to a new analysis released Wednesday.
The report, from analytics firm Trilliant Health, shows that quarterly prescriptions for those drugs increased 300% between early 2020 and the end of last year.
Novo Nordisk
’s weekly diabetes injection Ozempic accounted for more than 65% of total prescriptions as of the end of 2022, and was primarily prescribed off-label for its ability to help patients lose weight. 
The data further confirms the rise in demand for that group of drugs, which have fueled a frenzy among Americans and on Wall Street for their ability to cause significant weight loss. Those treatments, known as GLP-1s, mimic a hormone in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite. 
But the rate of future prescription volumes will largely depend on whether manufacturers of those drugs, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly
, can resolve widespread supply shortages affecting most of their treatments in the U.S., among other factors, according to the report.
The analysis is based on insurance claims data for about 300 million Americans. Among the other drugs prescribed are Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro and an older GLP-1 drug from Novo Nordisk called Saxenda, which isn’t as effective for weight loss as Ozempic and Wegovy.
But the total number of GLP-1 prescriptions is likely an undercount since some health plans don’t cover weight loss treatments like Wegovy, leaving some patients to pay for them out of pocket. 
Some people, such as Hollywood celebrities and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, are wealthy enough to pay for the drugs themselves. 
Ozempic’s list price tops $935 per monthly package, and its weight loss counterpart Wegovy is about $1,300. The drugs are meant to be taken indefinitely to keep weight off, just like cholesterol-lowering drugs or blood pressure medications that have to be taken for life. 
Other drugmakers are jockeying to capitalize on the budding weight loss industry. And analysts say Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro has the potential to overtake drugs from Novo Nordisk after its approved in the U.S. for weight loss. 
More than two in five adults have obesity, according to the National Institutes of Health. About 1 in 11 adults have severe obesity."
John Rosevear,UAW strikes threaten already vulnerable auto parts suppliers,"In this article
As the United Auto Workers’ strike against Ford Motor
, General Motors
and Stellantis
moves through its second week, the economic effects are beginning to ripple through the U.S. automakers’ vast supply base.
While the automakers and their larger Tier 1 suppliers likely have the resources to weather an extended work stoppage, there’s a network of smaller suppliers that could be hit hard by a prolonged strike — or even go out of business entirely.
That network includes about 5,600 companies — most in the upper Midwest — that provide seats, suspension components, wiring harnesses and thousands of other parts used in brand-name vehicles. It’s substantial, employing an estimated 871,000 workers, according to the American Automotive Policy Council.
Those smaller suppliers have only recently recovered from the shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting global shortage of semiconductors. Now, they’re coming under pressure to increase their own workers’ wages — in an environment where higher interest rates have made it more costly to borrow money — and staring down the threat of ongoing auto workers’ strikes.
“We represent a lot of suppliers that are very, very concerned about where this is going,” said Dennis Devaney, a Detroit attorney who has represented both GM and Ford and who once served as a board member for the National Labor Relations Board.
Devaney noted that some suppliers are still struggling with supplies of semiconductors and other components, in part because their Chinese counterparts are still recovering from Covid-related shutdowns and other logistical issues since the global health crisis.
“The last thing they need from an economic perspective is a strike by the UAW,” he said.
Some of the small suppliers may only be able to hold out a few weeks if the automaker factories they support are struck.
Harbour Results, a manufacturing advisory firm near Detroit, estimates that about 30% of those smaller suppliers were in poor financial shape — or “unbankable” in Harbour’s view — as of the end of 2022, with another 21% characterized as struggling.  
The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, or MEMA, a trade group that represents auto suppliers, has asked the White House for aid, writing in a Monday letter to President Joe Biden that it was particularly concerned about smaller suppliers with annual revenues of less than $200 million.
“These suppliers are in every state throughout the U.S. and are often the largest employer in a county or region,” MEMA wrote. “In a recent industry survey, half of these suppliers were identified as financially distressed.”
MEMA asked President Biden to use existing authority to direct the Small Business Administration to provide low-interest loans to suppliers to help them meet payroll so they can restart quickly once the strike is resolved.
“Note that it only takes one component that is unavailable from a supplier to shut down an entire production line,” the association wrote. “We urge you to act now to support the vehicle supplier community.”
In the face of prolonged strikes, some smaller suppliers are already cutting workers or announcing plans to do so.
But layoffs could expose suppliers to another risk: In a still-tight labor market, those laid-off employees might be able to find other jobs quickly, meaning they might not be available to come back once the UAW’s strikes are resolved.
LM Manufacturing, which makes seats for vehicles including the Ford Bronco, temporarily laid off about 650 workers last week in response to the UAW’s strike at the Detroit-area Ford plant that builds the Bronco. The Detroit-based company is a joint venture between privately held LAN Manufacturing and Canadian auto supplier Magna International
, a Tier 1 heavyweight.
As of Tuesday, two additional Detroit-area auto suppliers had already filed notices of potential layoffs with the state of Michigan.
Parts maker CIE Newcor, a subsidiary of Spain’s CIE Automotive, filed a notice with the state of Michigan on Sep. 14 saying that it will lay off nearly 300 workers early next month if the strike continues. Privately held Eagle Industries, a maker of molded foam products for autos, said on Sep. 21 that it may soon need to lay off an estimated 171 of its 230 employees “due to evolving business circumstances.”
“For every GM job, there’s six others in the economy that depend on us running,” GM CEO Mary Barra told CNBC. “We’ve got to get back to work.”
Larger publicly traded suppliers such as Lear Corporation
, Dana, Magna International
and Adient
aren’t expected to come out of the UAW’s strike unscathed. However, they haven’t experienced widespread effects just yet.   
Barclays previously identified Dana as one of the most affected suppliers from the first round of UAW strikes that halted production at one assembly plant each for the Detroit automakers, beginning Sept. 15. The Ohio-based company — a supplier of axles, driveshafts, transmissions and other parts — makes components for several vehicles affected by the strikes.
Dana, which did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment, has reportedly announced temporary layoffs of hundreds of Ohio workers due to striking UAW members at Jeep and Ford plants.
If the UAW’s strike drags on and expands further past its current three assembly plants and 38 parts and distribution centers, Wall Street analysts believe that’s when larger publicly traded suppliers will really start to feel the strain.
Some analysts also warn that automakers may put additional pressure on suppliers to lower costs in an effort to offset expected multibillion-dollar increases in any tentative agreements reached by GM, Ford and Stellantis, also known as original equipment suppliers, or OEMs.
“This creates another tension point in the debate in OEM-supplier commercial discussions,” Barclays analyst Dan Levy told CNBC. “There’s some suppliers that probably legitimately can push back but there’s also probably some suppliers where it does create a little more complexity.”
Historically, automakers have raised prices on new vehicles to offset higher labor costs and protect margins, but inflation as well as higher commodity costs have already pushed vehicle prices up, leaving little room for upward movement.
Barclays expects the new UAW contracts to add between $2 billion and $3 billion of incremental costs annually to the automakers’ balance sheets.
Spokespeople with Lear, Magna and Adient did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment."
Laya Neelakandan,Shoppers face higher orange juice prices as futures hit another record,"Orange juice is the latest item to succumb to higher prices at the grocery store, with futures on the commodity good reaching an all-time high this week.
Future prices for the breakfast staple have been steadily climbing over the past few months, hitting a record high of $3.69 per pound Tuesday morning. That number is up 13% month to date and almost 78% year to date.
With the price hike, the juice joins other major grocery store items facing high prices even as inflation slows, including raw sugar and cocoa.
The drink’s price has shot up due to hurricanes and bad weather that slammed Florida — the main producer of orange juice for the U.S. — last year, which reduced the crop to its lowest level in nearly 80 years. A late freeze at the end of last year also devastated the crops.
In July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it expected Florida to produce just around 15.9 million boxes of oranges this year, down 70% from the 2020-21 season.
Other exporters such as Brazil and Mexico also lowered their estimated yields for the year, citing crop difficulties from warmer weather."

Hollywood writers and studios have finalized the language of a tentative contract that will lead to the end to a nearly 150-day labor strike.
Union leaders “voted unanimously to lift the restraining order and end the strike as of 12:01 am PT/3:01 am ET on Wednesday, September 27th,” the WGA said in a statement.
Talks between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which includes top studios like Disney, Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery, resumed after months of starts and stops, ultimately leading to a preliminary deal.
The deal will last until May 2026 and includes a 5% minimum pay increase upon the ratification of the contract. Another 4% bump will occur on May 2, 2024, and another 3.5% increase will be instituted on May 5, 2025.
Writers were able to gain significant protections against the use of artificial intelligence. Namely, AI cannot write or rewrite literary material and AI-generated material will not be considered source material.
When it comes to streaming, the guild negotiated a new residual based on viewership. High budget subscription video on demand series and films that are viewed by 20% or more of the service’s domestic subscribers in the first 90 days of release get a bonus equal to 50% of the fixed domestic and foreign residual. Views are calculated by hours streamed domestically of the season or film divided by the runtime.
This new structure will go into effect on Jan. 1 and means writers would receive a bonus of $9,031 for a half-hour episode, $16,415 for a one-hour episode, or $40,500 for a streaming feature with a budget of over $30 million budget.
Streamers will also provide the guild the total number of hours streamed both domestically and internationally for self-produced high budget streaming programs like Netflix’s original series.
Across the board, scribes will see an increased contribution rate to their health and pensions as well as increased contributions for writing teams.
The agreement also improved screenwriter compensation, writers’ room minimums and renewed a $250,000 showrunner training program, among other items.
The negotiating committee recommended the agreement and sent it to the Writers Guild of America West Board and the Writers Guild of America East Council for approval. Both the board and council voted to authorize a contract ratification vote by membership.
WGA members will have until Oct. 9 to cast their votes on the contract, the union said.
Once negotiations are wrapped up with writers, the AMPTP will need to pivot to negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The acting guild’s members have been on strike since mid-July and are seeking contract updates similar to those requested by the writers.
The WGA contract could act as a template for SAG-AFTRA to draft its own deal with Hollywood studios.
Similar to writers, actors are looking to improve wages, working conditions, and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV.
SAG-AFTRA has also looked to standardize the self-tape process, which became popular during the pandemic. Previously, actors would have an even playing field with in-person camera tests, but in recent years, actors have seen inequity in auditioning between those who can afford quality camera and lighting equipment and those who can’t.

Diana Olick,Mortgage demand shrinks as interest rates hit highest level in nearly 23 years,"Mortgage interest rates just hit a level not seen since the year 2000. As a result, mortgage demand is now sitting near a 27-year low.
Total mortgage application volume fell 1.3% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume was 25.5% lower than the same week one year ago.
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.41%, from 7.31%, with points decreasing to 0.71 from 0.72 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. The rate was 6.52% one year ago.
The 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage rate increased to 7.34%, the highest rate in the history of the MBA’s jumbo rate series dating back to 2011.
“Based on the FOMC’s most recent projections, rates are expected to be higher for longer, which drove the increase in Treasury yields,” said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, referencing the Federal Open Market Committee. “Overall applications declined, as both prospective homebuyers and homeowners continue to feel the impact of these elevated rates.”
Applications to refinance a home loan fell 1% for the week and were 21% lower than they were one year ago. After record low interest rates throughout the first few years of the pandemic, and a refinance boom, there are precious few borrowers now with mortgage rates high enough to benefit from a refinance.
Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 2% for the week and were 27% lower than the same week year over year.
Today’s potential buyers are facing an unprecedented dynamic of a historically low supply of homes for sale, coupled with both rising interest rates and rising prices. Higher interest rates historically throw cold water on home prices, but the supply and demand imbalance is so severe that it is pushing prices higher even though more and more buyers are unable to afford a home.
Interest rates continued to move higher this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. Even sales of newly built homes, which had been rising due to the short supply on the resale market, took a hit in August, according to another report this week. Sales dropped nearly 9% in August from July’s pace, hitting the lowest level since March."
Melissa Repko,"Target says it will close nine stores in major cities, citing violence, theft","In this article
Target
said Tuesday that it will close nine stores in major cities across the country, citing violence, theft and organized retail crime.
The company will close one store in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood, two locations in Seattle, three stores in the San Francisco-Oakland area and three more in Portland, Oregon. The discounter said it will shutter the stores for good on Oct. 21.
“We cannot continue operating these stores because theft and organized retail crime are threatening the safety of our team and guests, and contributing to unsustainable business performance,” Target said in a news release.
“We know that our stores serve an important role in their communities, but we can only be successful if the working and shopping environment is safe for all.” 
Target, which has nearly 2,000 stores in the U.S., has been outspoken about organized retail crime at its stores. It has said theft has driven higher levels of shrink, an industry term used to describe losses from goods that were damaged, misplaced or stolen.
With its announcement Tuesday, Target also stands apart in its decision to both shutter stores and to explicitly blame that decision on retail crime.
When the company reported fiscal second-quarter earnings in mid-May, CEO Brian Cornell said organized retail crime had shot up at its stores. He added shrink overall is expected to reduce Target’s full-year profitability by more than $500 million compared to the year-ago period. 
When asked if the company plans to close stores because of rising shrink, Cornell stressed Target’s reluctance to shutter locations.
“We do not want to close stores. We know how important our stores are. They create local jobs, they generate taxes, they’re very important for those local shoppers, and they play a critical role in communities across the country,” Cornell said on a call with reporters in May.
“We’ll continue to do everything in our power to keep our doors open,” he added. “At the same time, we’ll be closely monitoring the safety of our team and guests as well as the financial impact to our business as we determine the right path forward at Target.” 
The retail executive’s comments led other companies to speak out on the problem, too, and to advocate for legislative reform. Following the passage of the Inform Act, which requires online marketplaces to disclose the identities of certain high-volume sellers to deter the sale of stolen and counterfeit goods, retailers and trade associations are now pushing for the passage of another bill called the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act. 
The bill, which Target said it supports in Tuesday’s news release, proposes stiffer penalties for theft offenses and calls for a change in the threshold prosecutors must meet before bringing federal theft cases. It would also provide retailers with a formal venue to exchange information with one another and law enforcement through the proposed Organized Retail Crime Coordination Center.
Since 2022, at least nine states — six so far this year — have passed similar laws to impose harsher penalties for organized retail crime offenses. Behind the sweep of legislation are retailers and trade associations, which are using their collective power to get the bills written and past the finish line.
Store closures, or the threat of them, have been a major factor in retailers convincing lawmakers to get on board, policy experts previously told CNBC. 
Target’s business has struggled for more than a year with company-specific challenges, including a glut of unsold inventory, backlash to its Pride merchandise collection and a pullback in consumer spending on discretionary items such as apparel and home goods.
Over the past two decades, Target had not mentioned shrink hitting its margins during earnings calls until August 2022, when the company’s and other retailers’ profits were getting hurt by higher markdowns while trying to unload unwanted merchandise, CNBC previously reported. When inventories rise, shrink tends to increase as well, industry experts told CNBC.
The company previously said its shrink numbers vary widely by location and do not correlate with inventory levels.
Target said Tuesday that it has taken a variety of steps to stop crime at its stores. Those measures include adding locked cases for some merchandise, hiring third-party guard services, training store leaders about how to de-escalate potentially dangerous situations and investing in cyber defense to stop fraud or organized crime.
Yet, Target said at the affected stores, a larger security team and theft-deterrent tools weren’t enough.
“Despite our efforts, unfortunately, we continue to face fundamental challenges to operating these stores safely and successfully,” Target said in the release.
The company said it will work with employees at the closed stores to give them an opportunity to transfer to another Target location. 
It’s not clear what actions the company is taking to improve inventory management. 
Target announced the store closures on the same day the National Retail Federation, the industry’s major trade association, released its latest National Retail Security Survey. The survey found the effect of theft on retailers’ bottom lines is about the same as it has been for years.
Total retail shrink grew to more than $112 billion in 2022, up from $93.9 billion the year before, according to the survey. The metric is calculated using total U.S. retail sales and generally rises as retail sales climb. 
When reported as a percentage of sales as is commonly done, average annual shrink increased to 1.57%, up from 1.44% in 2021. The share is largely in line with past years and is considered a normal and healthy level of shrink by industry experts. Generally, retailers plan for about 1% to 2% of shrink each year. 
Target joins a growing list of retailers that have shuttered stores in major cities, including Walmart
, Nordstrom
and Walgreens Boots Alliance
.
Nordstrom closed its San Francisco flagship store and Nordstrom Rack location in the city this summer after operating there for more than 35 years.
Yet, the company cited market dynamics rather than crime. In a message to employees at the time, then-Chief Stores Officer Jamie Nordstrom said changes in downtown San Francisco had hurt “customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully.”
A brazen smash and grab in August at one of Nordstrom’s other locations, a store in Los Angeles, made national headlines.
On an earnings call in late August, the company was asked about the widely circulated video of the crime. CEO Erik Nordstrom described the incident as “disturbing to all of us,” and said losses from theft are “at historical highs.” But, he added, theft is included in company guidance and not higher than expected.
In a December interview with CNBC, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warned that stores will close if shoplifters aren’t aggressively prosecuted.
Walmart has also closed some stores, including four in Chicago in April, but didn’t blame theft. In a news release at the time, the retailer said it has struggled to make the locations profitable and challenges have intensified. It said the stores “lose tens of millions of dollars a year, and their annual losses nearly doubled in just the last five years.”
Walgreens, similar to Target, specifically pointed to organized retail crime as the reason for shuttering some stores in San Francisco in 2021."
Brandon Gomez,"U.S. Latino economic output grows to $3.2 trillion, according to new study","The U.S. Latino economy continues to grow, reaching $3.2 trillion in 2021, up from $2.8 trillion the year prior, according to a new report by the Latino Donor Collaborative in partnership with Wells Fargo.
Over the last decade, the U.S. Latino economy has grown two and a half times faster than the non-Latino equivalent, surpassing the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom, India, France and Italy, according to the report released Wednesday by LDC, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group focused on reshaping perceptions of U.S. Latinos through data and economic research.
If Latinos were an independent country, their GDP would rank fifth in the world, the study found.
“We have a massive economy that’s under-invested right now, under-engaged,” said Sol Trujillo, Latino Donor Collaborative chairman, in an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”
Lea este artículo en español aquí.
Industry strength for Latinos remains steady in accommodation and food services, construction, administrative support, waste management and transportation.
While growth for the Latino community remains widespread in the U.S. geographically, the community drove particular growth in the states of California, Texas and Florida, amounting to $682 billion, $465 billion and $240 billion of economic impact, respectively.
That is largely due to the Latino community’s strong population share, labor force participation and overall productivity in those states.
“I would say if you look at the charts now that we have in our study, 48 out of the 50 states’ growth is tied to this [Latino] cohort,” Trujillo said.
The California Latino economy alone would rank as the 21st largest economy in the world, between Poland and Switzerland, according to LDC’s analysis.
In Latino emerging markets, South Dakota, North Dakota and New Hampshire have seen a surprising surge, with the highest GDP growth rates since 2011. In South Dakota, the economic impact of Latinos grew at an annual rate of 11.8% in 2021, according to LDC, slightly outpacing its neighbor.
“Businesses operating in these areas must stay ahead of these substantial changes to ensure they remain relevant,” LDC noted in the report. “And be able to meet the needs of their evolving customer base.”
The report also found that Latinos’ wages and salary incomes — totaling $1.67 trillion in 2021 — grew more than those of non-Latinos over the previous decade at an annualized rate of 4.7% compared to 1.9% for non-Latinos.
But despite the rapid growth, a substantial wage gap persists in the country, with the average Latino worker earning 80 cents for every $1 earned by white non-Hispanic employees.
Latinos’ purchasing power in the U.S. was strong and reached $3.4 trillion in 2021. Collective purchasing power of U.S. Latinos grew between 2.1 and 2.4 times faster than non-Latino counterparts, according to the report.
“In the rest of this century, this cohort is only going to get bigger and bigger,” said Trujillo. “So those who want to get in early, think about it. Think about capital and fund structures that could flow.”
The findings were released alongside the L’Attitude conference examining the state of Latino leadership, participation and representation in corporate America, as well as in the public, media and entertainment sectors.
The report is based on data from 2021, the most recent year for which information is publicly available. It includes data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among others."
Melissa Repko,"Costco tops quarterly earnings expectations, even as sales remain soft","In this article
Costco
on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street’s expectations, as shoppers turned to the membership club for groceries but bought fewer big-ticket items.
On an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said shoppers made more trips to the retailer’s stores, even as they spent less. He said sales of pricier items in the U.S., outside of food, were weaker and falling gas prices also weighed on revenue.
Traffic rose 5.2% worldwide and 5% in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis. Costco’s average transaction amount in the quarter dropped nearly 4% worldwide and 4.5% in the U.S., he said.
Here’s what the membership-based warehouse club reported for the three-month period that ended Sept. 3 compared with what analyst were expecting, according to consensus estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
Costco’s net income for the fiscal fourth quarter rose to $2.2 billion, or $4.86 per share, compared with $1.87 billion, or $4.20 per share, a year earlier.
Comparable sales for the company rose 1.1% year over year but only 0.2% in the U.S. Excluding changes in gas prices, the metric rose 3.8% overall and 3.1% in the U.S.
Costco has gained momentum in the past three years, as membership-based warehouse clubs benefited from dynamics such as more Americans cooking from home and more millennials moving into suburban homes with bigger pantries during the pandemic. Inflation has also driven some shoppers to sign up and renew their memberships to clubs, including Walmart
-owned Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club
.
Those favorable membership trends continued in the quarter. Costco ended the period with 71 million paid household members, up nearly 8% from a year ago. That growth outpaced its rate of new store openings, which grew by slightly under 3%.
Costco has also gotten more of those members to spring for its pricier membership. The higher-tier, called Executive Membership, costs $120 on an annual basis compared to $60 for the typical annual membership, and includes some additional perks.
As of the end quarter, Costco had 32.3 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 981,000 since the end of the prior quarter. Those higher-tier members now account for slightly over 45% of all paid membership, Galanti said. They also account for about 73% of its global sales, he said.
In recent quarters, even Costco has spoken about consumers pulling back on some big-ticket and discretionary items, as grocery bills and housing costs remain elevated.
That trend has weighed in particular on Costco’s digital sales. E-commerce sales declined 0.8% compared with the year-ago period. On the earnings call, Galanti said customers are buying less of the items that tend to make up a bigger part of the company’s online sales, such as furniture, small electronics and jewelry.
But some discretionary items have popped on the company’s website, Galanti said. Sales of appliances rose more than 30% year over year in the quarter. And, he added, the company has had trouble keeping a new offering in stock: one ounce gold bars.
“When we load them on the site, they’re typically gone within a few hours and we limit two per member,” Galanti said.
Costco echoed a trend seen at rival retailers, including Walmart
and Target
: Groceries are the category driving sales.
Costco has also tried new approaches to get customers to toss more items in the basket when they’re shopping aisles outside of the grocery department, Galanti said. The retailer has added small-ticket items, such as cheaper, impulse-driven snacks.
It has kept merchandise fresh by carrying popular gaming systems and by the early debut of Christmas items. So far, trees, toys and decor have sold well, Galanti said.
In the U.S., Costco’s biggest market, sales trends have slowed. The majority of Costco’s clubs — nearly 600 of the company’s 861 warehouses — are in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
In the year-ago fiscal fourth quarter, comparable sales rose 15.8% in the U.S., but since then they have largely decelerated. In the past two quarters, comparable sales — an industry metric that takes out the effect of store openings and closures — were roughly flat in the U.S. from the prior-year periods.
Investors have been anticipating a membership fee hike for Costco that hasn’t occurred. Its last bump came in June 2017, and based on its typical practice, the retailer was due to increase it in early 2023. Those fees drive the bulk of Costco’s revenue.
On the earnings call, an analyst asked if a fee increase is part of the retailer’s fiscal plan.
Galanti said a hike in the amount that members pay is “a question of when, not if.” But he declined to specify when that may be.
In addition, Costco plans to open 10 new stores in the next three months, including nine in the U.S. and one in Canada, Galanti said. He said it finished the fiscal year with 23 net new locations, including stores in China, Japan and Australia. 
Shares of Costco have climbed about 21% so far this year, outperforming the 11% gains of the S&P 500. The company’s stock closed on Tuesday at $552.96, down about 1%."
Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Fast fashion is leaning into resale, but a new study finds it may not work","Fast-fashion retailers like Zara, Shein and H&M are using resale platforms to reduce their carbon footprints, but the programs are projected to do little to reduce emissions, a new study released Tuesday found. 
The brands could more effectively reduce their toll on the environment if they redirected those efforts to their supply chain, such as by using more sustainable materials or investing in recycling innovations, according to the analysis.
The study was conducted by Trove, which helps brands like Lululemon
and Canada Goose
implement resale programs, and Worldly, a data analytics firm that focuses on ESG, or environmental, social and corporate governance. The study’s methodology was validated with third parties and reviewed by Deloitte, McKinsey and University of California, Berkeley, among others, Trove’s founder and one of the study’s authors Andy Ruben told CNBC.
The study analyzed five brand archetypes, spanning fast fashion to premium apparel, and how reselling previously owned items could affect their overall carbon emissions between 2023 and 2040.
It found that fast-fashion retailers, which create about 11.5 kilograms (25.3 pounds) of carbon dioxide for every item they make, will only reduce their emissions by 0.7% with resale programs.
In comparison, premium apparel brands like Tory Burch and Ralph Lauren
create about 16 kilograms of CO2 for every item they make, and could reduce those emissions by 14.8% with resale programs, the analysis said. Outdoor brands, like Patagonia and the North Face, create about 12.5 kilograms of CO2 per item and could reduce emissions by 15.8%, according to the study. 
The projections factor in lower production of new items, which would help to cut emissions. Companies could offset decreased sales of new products with revenue gained from reselling a previously owned item. 
The findings come as a slew of companies – from apparel retailers like Gap
to home goods companies like The Container Store
– implement resale programs to capture customers who care about sustainability, or might just be looking for a deal. The initiatives allow companies to make money off of items they’ve already sold and show investors and consumers they’re focused on sustainability, especially as they prepare for new ESG reporting requirements from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Ruben said it takes a lot of work for fast-fashion retailers to implement resale programs, but “you’re not getting a lot of juice for the squeeze.” 
“It really comes down to how many people want your items after you’ve sold them the first time,” Ruben said in an interview with CNBC. “So if you sold an original T-shirt for $8, and you resell it for 20 cents, you’re not offsetting much revenue and you’re doing a lot of activity that adds to the carbon footprint to move it back around.”
Fast-fashion retailers have faced broad criticism for the negative impacts they can have on the environment. Some of the largest players in the space – H&M, Zara and Shein – have started resale programs in a bid to be more sustainable. 
Earlier this year, H&M announced it was partnering with ThredUp
to debut a resale program that allows customers to shop for pre-owned items. Zara and Shein both announced peer-to-peer resale platforms last fall. 
The programs, which some criticized as insufficient, help the environment in the sense that it’s more sustainable to buy a used item than it is to buy a new product. However, the programs can be difficult for fast-fashion retailers to scale profitably, which could limit investments in the efforts. Further, the study indicates resale platforms aren’t enough to meaningfully increase sustainability at fast-fashion companies.
“It’s misplaced effort,” said Ruben. “What they’re basically doing is moving around items that hold none of their value, which is a marketing program.”
Both Zara and H&M are working to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 and have disclosed some of the progress they’ve made in reducing their water consumption and using more sustainable materials, among other initiatives. 
In a statement, an H&M spokesperson said the company agrees with Trove’s report, which is why it’s “working with different levers” to reduce its impact on global carbon emissions.
“We are working towards decarbonizing our supply chain and logistics operations by strengthening the availability and usage of renewable energy and funding the innovation and distribution of technology needed,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said the company is increasing its use of recycled and more sustainably sourced materials, and aims to increase its use of recycled fibers to 30% by 2025.
Zara didn’t return a request for comment from CNBC.
Shein, for its part, often touts its inventory-light model as a crucial factor that reduces waste on the back end. The company has invested in strategies that reduce water use throughout its production process and launched its “evoluSHEIN” product line, which features garments made with recycled polyester, forest-safe viscose and other materials that are more eco-friendly.
“We continue to scale SHEIN’s on-demand business model, which allows us to achieve average unsold inventory rates in the low single digits, dramatically reducing waste, and invest in building circular systems and accelerating sustainable solutions through sustainably focused materials, technologies and production processes,” a Shein spokesperson told CNBC.
“As a fashion leader, we acknowledge our role in creating a more sustainable and responsible fashion industry, and SHEIN Exchange is just one step we are taking as part of our larger commitment to prioritizing waste reduction and circularity,” the spokesperson said.
To reduce their impact on the environment, fast-fashion retailers are better off redirecting their resale investments into recycling innovations and sustainable materials, among other practices that can reduce emissions, said Gayle Tait, Trove’s CEO. 
“What the research is underpinning is that brands have to demonstrate meaningful investment into shifting their model,” said Tait. “When they’re kind of skirting around the edges, by doing either a branded peer-to-peer site or working closely with a marketplace, they’re not actually shifting their model. They’re continuing to do the things that got their carbon emissions.”"
Gabrielle Fonrouge,Peloton co-founder and Chief Product Officer Tom Cortese is leaving the company,"In this article
Peloton
co-founder and Chief Product Officer Tom Cortese is leaving the company and will be replaced by longtime Silicon Valley veteran Nick Caldwell, the company announced Tuesday. 
Cortese, who helped found the connected fitness company alongside former CEO John Foley in 2012, will move into an advisory role beginning Nov. 1, the company said. 
“After nearly 12 years of pouring myself into Peloton and serving our Members, I have decided it is time to move on and create space for new perspectives,” Cortese said in a news release.
“I’m eager for new growth for Peloton and for me personally, but I’m also excited to support and watch this next phase of Peloton’s evolution. I could not be more proud of what we have accomplished, together.”
Caldwell most recently served on the board of tech companies Bitly, HubSpot and True Search and previously did stints at Twitter, Google, Reddit and Microsoft, where he worked for nearly 16 years at the start of his career, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
He’ll oversee global product development and will start the new role Nov. 1. 
“I want to thank Tom for his tireless dedication since launching Peloton nearly 12 years ago as a Co-Founder of the business. We simply wouldn’t be here today without his contributions,” CEO Barry McCarthy said in a statement. “Nick brings impressive engineering, design, and product experience to the Peloton team. Nick joins us at an exciting time as we lean into growing our subscriber base online and on our connected fitness hardware.”
The news comes more than a year into McCarthy’s stint as Peloton’s CEO. Since he took over, he has tapped Leslie Berland as the company’s marketing chief and Dalana Brand as its chief people officer, among other hires. Both Berland and Brand were executives at Twitter before joining Peloton. 
With Cortese’s departure, just two executives from Peloton’s early days remain in its C-suite. Jennifer Cotter, the company’s chief content officer, and Dion Camp Sanders, its chief emerging business officer, have both been with the company since Foley was at the helm. 
During an interview with CNBC earlier this year, Cortese recalled Peloton’s early days and what inspired him and Foley to start the business.
″[In] 2013, so 10 years ago now, I was standing in the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey, my kids thinking that I was a mall retail guy, and we were selling people on the idea of being able to access energetic, remarkable fitness from the most convenient place on Earth: their home,” Cortese told CNBC.
“The reason we were doing that is because what we saw happening in the real world … brick and mortar, was that people were turning to boutique studio fitness as something that was starting to excite them, right? So just going to the gym wasn’t quite doing it … hence the Peloton Bike, and all that goes with it, was born.”
Cortese started as the company’s chief operating officer and took over as product chief in August 2021, according to his LinkedIn. Most recently, he was involved in the development of Peloton’s app and the introduction of new product features on its connected fitness products.
Back in the company’s early days, Peloton was a product-first retailer that made the bulk of its revenue selling its pricey connected fitness products, including its Bike, Bike+ and Tread, as an alternative to the gym. 
However, in the years since, Peloton’s products have undergone numerous recalls for a series of manufacturing flaws, some that left customers injured. 
Its Tread+ treadmill was recalled after a child was killed. The company has since been mired in fines and legal battles related to its products and their recalls. 
When Peloton last reported earnings Aug. 23, executives said they believe the most recent recall of its Bike seat post led to increased membership churn and was costing the company far more than it anticipated. 
These days, subscription revenue is Peloton’s primary revenue driver. Earlier this year, it announced a massive brand overhaul that elevated Peloton’s subscription offerings and signaled the company is just as invested in its app as it is its hardware. 
While the company frequently insists hardware is still one of its primary focus areas, new product development appears to have slowed.
When asked earlier this year if the company had plans to introduce new hardware, Cortese hinted at more to come.
“We maintain a strong hardware development team,” he said. “They are certainly not twiddling their thumbs.”"
Bertha Coombs,Working women spend $15.4 billion more than men in out-of-pocket health costs,"High health-care costs are hitting women in the U.S. workforce much harder than men.
Working women spend $15.4 billion more in out-of-pocket health expenses annually compared to their male counterparts, according to a new analysis of employer-sponsored health plans from Deloitte Consulting.
The study found women spend 18% more than men on copays and deductibles, on average. That’s after excluding costs associated with pregnancy and maternity, according to the new report, and despite total health expenditures for women that are just 10% higher than for men.
“This is a problem we’re identifying that business leaders can actually solve within their own organizations. The takeaway being that women get paid less, and that they pay more for health care,” said Dr. Kulleni Gebreyes, U.S. chief health equity officer at Deloitte Consulting.
The result, she said, is a disproportionate financial burden.
Women tend to utilize more medical care than men, in part due to annual gynecological exams and the high costs of breast cancer imaging.
While annual exams are often fully covered, follow-ups that can result from those visits incur copays and trigger deductibles. Many of those services are often more expensive than the typical deductible, leading to a higher cost-sharing burden.    
Deloitte analysts say employers could close the $15.4 billion cost-sharing gender gap through enhanced benefits design, at an estimated cost of $133 per employee per year, or about $11 per month.
“Our ask is that companies look at their data; examine if and where the gaps exist and step back to have more of an equitable design process to come up with what are the health benefits that would meet the needs of their workforce,” said Gebreyes."

DETROIT — Strikes by the United Auto Workers union against General Motors
, Ford Motor
and Stellantis
will get the presidential treatment this week in Michigan. Twice, in fact.
President Joe Biden visited a picket line Tuesday at a GM parts facility in Belleville following a public invitation Friday from UAW President Shawn Fain, who joined Biden for the visit. Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner among Republicans in the 2024 presidential race, is scheduled to hold a rally Wednesday night at an auto supplier in Clinton Township, Michigan.
Biden and Trump are effectively tied in the polls over a year out from the election. Each 2024 presidential candidate is trying to win over blue-collar voters such as Darius Collier, one of about 18,300 autoworkers currently on strike, who says he’s “indifferent” about the candidates.
“It would be good if they actually show the support that we need to get through this,” said Collier, whose Mopar facility in Centerline, Michigan, is one of 10 parts and distribution centers set for potential closure under a recent contract proposal by Stellantis to consolidate facilities.
Michigan voters helped both Biden and Trump in winning the White House during the past two presidential elections, in 2020 and 2016, respectively. They’ve both gained union support, but in different ways.
While the UAW has historically supported Democrats, including Biden in 2020, Fain is withholding the union’s reendorsement of the president, who has touted himself as the “most pro-union president in American history.” Trump has won support of many rank-and-file union members.
“Both President Trump and President Biden understand the importance that Michigan has electorally and there’s a realization that elections can be very close, so they want to be seen frequently,” said Mark Burton, a partner at Honigman law firm and a former chief strategist of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. “The UAW strike is a wonderful, high-publicity moment to deploy their message and be seen once again.”
Michigan Democrats such as Whitmer and U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell have attended UAW rallies since the UAW’s Sept. 15 strikes began. However, Fain’s politician of choice has been Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran against Biden in 2020.
Fain has appeared with the independent senator from Vermont in Washington, D.C., and during a recent UAW rally in Detroit. He also has echoed Sanders’ messages of fighting “corporate greed” and has positioned the UAW’s collective bargaining with the Detroit automakers as a “war” between the billionaire and blue-collar classes.
Fain invited Biden to join the UAW picket lines days after Trump announced he would skip the second GOP debate to hold a rally in Macomb County, Michigan, where a large contingent of blue-collar autoworkers live.
“We invite and encourage everyone who supports our cause to join us on the picket line, from our friends and families all the way up to the president of the United States,” Fain said Friday during a Facebook Live stream.
Fain has not expressed much support for Biden, many times saying he needs to better prove his claim of being the “most pro-union president.” However, Fain’s made clear his position on Trump.
“Every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers,” Fain said last week in a statement. “We can’t keep electing billionaires and millionaires that don’t have any understanding what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to get by and expecting them to solve the problems of the working class.”
The UAW on Tuesday issued a largely generic press release ahead of Biden’s visit, saying it will “mark the first time a sitting U.S. President has joined striking workers on a picket line,” followed by several paragraphs about the union’s strike and no statement from Fain.
Fain, on the picket line with Biden at the Willow Run Redistribution Center, called the president joining the picket line a “historic moment.” But he did not officially endorse the commander-in-chief for next year’s presidential election.
“Today, I just want to take a moment to stand with all of you with our president and say thank you to the president. Thank you, Mr. President, for coming,” Fain said Tuesday. “We know the president will do right by the working class. And when we do right by the working class, you can leave the rest to us because we’re going to take care of this business.”
UAW is not affiliated with Trump’s Wednesday rally at Drake Enterprises, which is reportedly a non-union supplier of engine, transmission and other components for heavy truck, agriculture and automotive markets. But UAW members have previously attended and participated in Trump’s events in Michigan.
Fain has previously said a second Trump term in the White House would be a “disaster.” However, Trump, as he has in the past, is gaining blue-collar support.
“I like Trump,” said Niko Shinn, another autoworker who’s currently on strike at the Mopar plant. “He’s a good businessman and seems like he knows more about, not politics, but negotiating and stuff like that.”
Trump’s support among union members has increased as Biden’s has fallen in recent months, according to Michigan polling company EPIC·MRA. Trump led Biden 46% to 43% among union members in an August survey, after Biden led Trump 51% to 42% in June, according to Bernie Porn, president of EPIC·MRA.
“With union members, he has been so supportive of just about everything that union members want. The one thing that they’re concerned about is the push towards electric vehicles because they’re concerned about the fewer numbers of employees it takes to build an electric vehicle,” Porn said.
Electric vehicles, or EVs, are expected to require less labor and parts than the traditional vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines. They are expected to be one of several talking points Trump discusses during his Wednesday rally.
“President Trump’s rhetoric in his position stances, I think, stands clearly with the vast majority of the rank-and-file of the UAW who are concerned about their jobs being eliminated by this Biden administration forced transition to electric vehicles,” said Jamie Roe, a Republican strategist based in Macomb County, where Trump’s rally is being held.
Fain has said the union is withholding a reelection endorsement for Biden until the union’s concerns about the auto industry’s transition to all-electric vehicles are addressed.
Biden’s visit may be an olive branch to assist in the UAW’s eventual endorsement as well as potential leverage for the union in its ongoing negotiations with the Detroit automakers.
“I think the president’s visit, particularly if Shawn Fain is joining [Biden] on a picket line, I think it is another stroke of strategy that increases the pressure and increases the overall strength of the union when it comes to the actual negotiations with the autos,” Burton said."
Courtney Reagan,"Retail theft isn’t actually increasing much, major industry study finds","Retail theft has caught the attention of the masses in recent years, from startling smash-and-grab videos during the depths of the Covid pandemic to corporate earnings calls where retailers like Target
and Foot Locker
are discussing losses from organized retail crime more than they ever have.
But the effect of theft on retailers’ bottom lines is about the same as it has been for years, according to the latest data released Tuesday in the widely used industry survey conducted by the National Retail Federation.
Total retail shrink grew to more than $112 billion in 2022, up from $93.9 billion the year before, according to the newest National Retail Security Survey. The metric, which accounts for various types of inventory loss including theft, damage and vendor error, generally rises as retail sales climb.
While retailers and the NRF are increasingly saying crime is cutting into profits, losses from internal and external theft last year were largely on par with historical trends. They made up 65% of total shrink, the survey found.
External theft, which includes organized retail crime, was again reported as the largest source of shrink last year at 36.15%, but that was slightly below 37% in 2021. Internal theft, or goods stolen by employees, rose slightly to 28.85% from 28.5% in 2021. Process and control failures and errors made up 27.29% of shrink in 2022, up from 25.7% the year prior.
External theft (including organized retail crime): 36.15%
Internal/employee theft: 28.85%
Process/control errors: 27.29%
Unknown: 5.88%
Other losses: 1.32%
Source: NRF National Retail Security Survey
Retail shrink climbed in absolute dollars, but when reported as a percentage of sales as is commonly done, average annual shrink increased to 1.57%, up from 1.44% in 2021. The share is largely in line with past years. Average annual shrink was 1.62% of sales before the pandemic in 2019, though it was as low as 1.33% in 2017, according to previous surveys.
The NRF conducted the online survey of senior loss prevention and security executives in the retail industry. The results for 2022 include 177 retail brand respondents, which the organization said accounted for 22% of retail sales in 2022.
The NRF report said 78% of the retailers that responded to the survey do not include e-commerce goods in their shrink calculation and 57% don’t include supply chain losses, so “the actual dollar loss associated with shrink (and with theft in particular) is likely heavily underreported.”
It’s not necessarily the amount of theft taking place that most concerns the industry, but rather the increased violence associated with it.
“Far beyond the financial impact of these crimes, the violence and concerns over safety continue to be the priority for all retailers, regardless of size or category,” David Johnston, vice president for asset protection and retail operations at the NRF, said in a press release.
Sixty-seven percent of respondents reported more violence associated with organized retail crime than a year ago. In the last survey, 81% reported an increase in violence.
Meanwhile, 45% of retailers in the survey said they have reduced specific store hours to deal with crime and violence, nearly 30% said they somehow changed store product selection, and 28% reported closing a specific location because of crime.
Companies identified Los Angeles, San Francisco/Oakland, Houston, New York and Seattle as the five cities and metropolitan areas most affected by retail crime.
Unsurprisingly, nearly all respondents, 93%, support some type of federal organized retail crime legislation. Congress passed one law, called the Inform Act, that aims to deter the sale of stolen goods online, and lawmakers have introduced another that calls for stiffer penalties for theft offenses. The NRF supports the bill and previously told CNBC it helped to write it.
Internal, or employee theft, also concerns retailers because “an employee who decides to steal or collude with outsiders to steal often does so at a higher loss per incident than external thieves.” Some companies have identified goods stolen by workers as a major issue and taken steps to address it, even as the industry focuses more on external theft in public, CNBC previously reported.
The NRF study said the average dollar loss reported for an internal theft was $2,180 per investigation in 2022, in line with 2021 and 2020 levels. The average dollar loss for external shoplifting incidents, for comparison, was $1,063 per incident.
It’s not only high-value products that are being stolen, but also consumable items that are easy to resell and often difficult to track. So while luxury items often get the “smash and grab” attention, energy drinks, beauty products, candles and detergent are also among the products thieves target."
Drew Richardson,"Diller rips WGA deal, says fair use needs to be redefined to address AI","Slamming the tentative labor deal between Hollywood writers and studios, media mogul Barry Diller on Tuesday laid out his biggest bone of contention with generative artificial intelligence.
Diller, chair of IAC and Expedia, called for the law to be redefined to protect published material from capture in the knowledge bases of artificial intelligence.
“Fair use needs to redefined, because what they have done is sucked up everything and that violates the basis of the copyright law,” Diller said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “All we want to do is establish that there is no such thing as fair use for AI, which gives us standing.”
Diller’s complaints came as prominent authors, including George R.R. Martin and Jodi Picoult, have sued OpenAI for copyright infringement. His remarks also followed on the heels of the Writers Guild of America’s tentative agreement with Hollywood studios to end a nearly 150-day strike.
Diller isn’t a fan of the deal.
“They spent months trying to craft words to protect writers from AI and they ended up with a paragraph that protected nothing from no one,” Diller said.
The details of the tentative deal between the WGA and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have not been made public. Hollywood studios are expected to walk away with the right to use and train AI models using writers’ work, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the negotiations. On the other hand, writers are expected to be guaranteed compensation for work they do on scripts, even if the studios employ an AI tool, the Journal report added.
Legacy media and AI companies, most notably ChatGPT creator OpenAI, have clashed on what content should be allowed into the knowledge base of generative artificial intelligence. Critics of AI point to the fair use doctrine under U.S. copyright law, which permits limited portions of a work to be used without a license or compensation. Generative AI and language-based model systems index entire bodies of work within their knowledge base, a violation of fair use, some argue.
According to Diller, that’s one of his key points of contention with Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.
“The thing that Sam and I disagree and have talked about is that he believes fair use allows him to take all of a publisher’s [work],” said Diller. “We believe that it doesn’t.”
Altman, who also served on the Expedia board with Diller, testified before senators in May to discuss regulations on AI.
“We think that creators deserve control over how their creations are used, and what happens sort of beyond the point of them releasing it into the world,” Altman said during the hearing. “We need to figure out new ways with this new technology that creators can win, succeed and have a vibrant life, and I’m optimistic that this will present it.”
CNBC has reached out to OpenAI for a response to Diller’s remarks.
Shutterstock, a stock media service and OpenAI partner since 2021, set up a contributors fund for creators which provides compensation if their intellectual property is used during AI content generation. Altman also said that Shutterstock was critical in the training of OpenAI’s generative media AI, DALL-E."
Diana Olick,"Sales of newly built homes reverse course, drop nearly 9% in August","Sales of newly built homes fell 8.7% in August from July to a seasonally adjusted annualized pace of 675,000 units, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
That is the slowest pace since March. Sales were still 5.8% higher than August 2022.
The Census count is based on signed contracts during the month, and mortgage rates took a sharp jump higher. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan ended July at 7.04%, according to Mortgage News Daily. By Aug. 22, it was at 7.48%.
“Very stretched affordability means demand will be unable to recover in the near term, causing new home sales to fall back from 675,000 annualized in August to 600,000 annualized by the end of the year,” wrote Imogen Pattison, assistant economist at Capital Economics.
The median price of a newly built home sold in August was $430,300, a drop of 2% compared to August of last year. Homebuilders have been lowering prices as well as offering more incentives, such as buying down mortgage rates. They had slowed those incentives last spring, when rates went below 7%, but they are ramping them up again.
One of the nation’s largest homebuilders, Lennar, recently reported strong earnings, but that was for a quarter where mortgage rates hadn’t hit their highest yet. Lennar Chairman Stuart Miller, however, noted buyer incentives in the release.
“Homebuilders continued to use incentives, including buy-downs, to offset rising interest rates and tighter capital, which limit affordability,” said Miller.
Homebuilders continue to benefit from the extremely tight supply of existing homes for sale, but that boost may finally be overcome by higher interest rates. Builder sentiment dropped into negative territory in September for the first time in seven months, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ monthly survey.
In September, 32% of builders said they cut prices, compared to 25% in August. That’s the largest share of builders reducing prices since December 2022, when 35% were doing so.
The average price cut was 6%.
“High mortgage rates are clearly taking a toll on builder confidence and consumer demand, as a growing number of buyers are electing to defer a home purchase until long-term rates move lower,” Robert Dietz, NAHB’s chief economist, said in a release."
