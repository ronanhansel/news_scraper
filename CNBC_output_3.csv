Robert Frank,The number of people with at least $100 million has doubled since 2003,"The population of the super wealthy, or those worth $100 million or more, doubled over the past 20 years as asset prices soared around the world, according to a new report.
There are now 28,420 so-called centi-millionaires worldwide, up 12% over last year and more than twice the number in 2003, according to a new report from Henley & Partners, a wealth and migration advisory firm, which used data from New World Wealth.
The surge in centi-millionaires reflects the rapid rise in asset values fueled by low interest rates, which boosted the values of everything from real estate and land to stocks, private companies and art. The rise of tech wealth, especially in the U.S., has also helped fuel the growth in the super wealthy. The number of billionaires in the world has skyrocketed from under 500 people in 2003 to more than 2,600 people today, according to Forbes and other wealth-tracking firms.
Low interest rates and the resulting flood of money across the world since the 2008 financial crisis have also made the money effectively worth less, which has added to the growth of centi-millionaires in terms of dollars.
“The value of money has declined, so in dollar terms, you would expect more centi-millionaires,” said Andrew Amoils, head of research at New World Wealth. “It has also been fueled by strong growth in the U.S. and Asia.”
Amoils said most of today’s centi-millionaires made their fortunes by starting their own companies or helping fund startups. The U.S. is still the dominant capital of entrepreneurship and centi-millionaires, with 38% of the global population worth $100 million or more, according to the report.

With the era of ultra-low interest rates gone for now, the growth rate for centi-millionaires may slow. The report projects the centi-millionaire population will grow 38% over the next decade, from 28,420 people to about 39,000 people by 2033.
“It does look like the next 10 years will be slower than the past 10 years,” Amoils said.
Although the media tends to focus more on billionaires, the report said centi-millionaires are more representative of the world’s super wealthy. The dollar threshold for what it means to be “super wealthy” has increased rapidly over time, said Juerg Steffen, CEO of Henley & Partners.
“Not long ago, in the late 1990s, $30 million was considered by most banks as the fortune that was needed to meet this status,” he said. “However, asset prices have risen significantly since then, making $100 million the new benchmark.”
While many smaller, less-developed countries have very few billionaires, they may have dozens or even hundreds of centi-millionaires. Amoils said there is often little visible difference in lifestyle between a person worth $100 million and a billionaire.
“They might fly on a private jet and have multiple homes,” he said. “And aside from maybe philanthropy,” their lifestyle would basically look the same.”"
Michael Wayland,"Canadian autoworkers strike against General Motors, joining UAW","In this article
DETROIT — Labor strikes are now an international issue for General Motors
after the Detroit automaker failed to reach a tentative agreement by Monday for roughly 4,300 workers represented by Canadian union Unifor.
The Canadian autoworkers will join roughly 9,200 United Auto Workers members who are on strike in the U.S. at two assembly plants and 18 parts and distribution centers for GM. The U.S. strike started Sept. 15 and has since expanded.
The new strikes in the Canadian province of Ontario affect an assembly plant that produces light- and heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado trucks; production of some V-6 and V-8 engines used in a variety of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox; and a stamping facility that produces parts for various cars and trucks.
Unifor National President Lana Payne said GM “continues to fall short on our pension demands, income supports for retired workers, and meaningful steps to transition temporary workers into permanent, full-time jobs.”
Unifor, which represents 18,000 Canadian workers at the Detroit automakers, took a more traditional approach to its negotiations than its U.S. counterpart. The Canadian union is negotiating with each automaker separately and using a deal first reached last month with Ford as a “pattern” for GM and Chrysler parent Stellantis
.
Payne said in a release early Tuesday that GM is “stubbornly refusing to meet the pattern agreement.”
GM, in a statement, said the company is “disappointed” that a deal couldn’t be reached following “very positive progress on several key priorities over the past weeks.”
“We remain at the bargaining table and are committed to keep working with Unifor to reach an agreement that is fair and flexible,” GM said.
Ford’s three-year deal included hourly wage increases of up to 25%, reactivation of a cost-of-living allowance to battle inflation and a shorter progression for workers to reach top pay, among other new or altered benefits.
The agreement, which covers more than 5,600 workers at Ford facilities in Canada, was ratified by 54% of workers who voted. 
That traditional patterned bargaining approach runs counter to the UAW’s new strategy of bargaining with all three automakers at once.
The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began, after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand-up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts in which all plants simultaneously strike.
Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike. UAW President Shawn Fain previously said the union would increase the work stoppages based on progress in the negotiations.
Thousands of other UAW members have been laid off as a result of the strikes, including roughly 2,175 workers at other GM facilities. Most notably, the Detroit automaker was forced to idle production of a Kansa assembly plant that produces Chevrolet Malibu sedans and Cadillac XT4 crossovers."
Drew Richardson,‘Shark Tank’ star Daymond John’s Black Entrepreneurs Day to return,"“Shark Tank” star Daymond John is looking to give Black business owners a boost for the fourth year running.
The FUBU CEO’s Black Entrepreneurs Day, billed as a celebration of Black business, will return Nov. 1. The event will feature a lineup of celebrity guests such as Whoopi Goldberg and Shaquille O’Neal and insights from top Black business leaders.
Eight winners of a $25,000 entrepreneurship grant will also get the opportunity to appear alongside John during the event. The event will take place at the Apollo Theater in Manhattan and will also be broadcast online via livestream.
This year marks the fourth year of the event, which was first created in part to address “frustration over injustice” after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Black Entrepreneurs Day was launched later that year to “celebrate” Black business owners amid a focus on systemic racism and economic inequities.
“I remember when Rodney King happened,” John told CNBC. “I did not go and burn businesses — I built one.”
Since 2020, Black Entrepreneurs Day has attracted big-name corporations including JPMorgan Chase
’s Chase for Business and Shopify
.
As the event enters its fourth year, enthusiasm among corporate sponsors has not matched what it was in 2020, when it launched on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic and widespread Black Lives Matter protests pushing for racial equity.
“It was very easy [to get corporations on board] the first year,” John said. “I said, ‘Will you stand by me and say that you are on the right side of this discussion?’”
Many of the companies standing behind Black Entrepreneurs Day have launched initiatives to support the Black community. Chase allocated $30 billion as part of a racial equity commitment in 2020, which has since been used to deploy 15,000 small business loans, among other initiatives.
John said companies need to show continued support for Black businesses beyond a one-time commitment.
“If you don’t have people in your organization that look like the ones you are serving, then you’re going to chase what’s shinier every day,” John said. “You may think that the systemic issues were solved” by the donation you gave.
John lauded brands including Chase, T-Mobile, The General Insurance and Shopify, which he said have stayed on the “right side” of the issue. He said the companies don’t just hand over money, but also go the extra mile to invest in the Black community.
This year, Black Entrepreneurs Day will feature a star-studded guest list including Goldberg, O’Neal, Cedric the Entertainer, Anthony Anderson and Rick Ross, to discuss their journey as Black entertainers and entrepreneurs.
“People want to know what they did at their lowest point and how they got out of circumstances that many of us have been in or are currently in,” John said.
Black Entrepreneurs Day will partner with the NAACP to give eight entrepreneurs $25,000 issued through the NAACP Powershift Entrepreneur Grant. Business owners who apply and win one of the eight grants will be able to get mentorship from John and join him during the event broadcast.
The grant gets tens of thousands of applications, even outpacing the entries submitted to “Shark Tank,” a globally recognized show, John told CNBC.
The Shopify Pitch Competition will return to this year’s Black Entrepreneurs Day. Current Shopify merchants will have the chance to pitch to three judges live during the broadcast. Winners will be awarded $25,000 and mentorship from John.
Black-owned businesses were hit especially hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and when federal assistance became available, Black business owners saw less of that money than their white counterparts.
“When the money was issued throughout Covid, a lot of Black farmers and African American businesses got a very small percentage of it and it took them much longer to get it,” John said.
Paycheck Protection Program loans largely failed to reach areas with the highest concentrations of Black-owned businesses, CNBC reported in 2020.
Several businesses have flourished with the money and mentorship provided by the grant, John said, and some business owners are now able to keep their businesses open due in part to the grant funds.
Programming note: John will appear on CNBC’s “Mad Money” at 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday."
Sarah Whitten,Hollywood writers ratify new contract with studios,"The Writers Guild of America has officially ratified its new three-year contract with Hollywood studios.
The guild on Monday announced that 99% of its membership voted to ratify the new deal, with 8,435 votes for “yes” and only 90 for “no.” The terms of the new agreement go from Sept. 25 through May 1, 2026.
“Through solidarity and determination, we have ratified a contract with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of our combined membership,” said Meredith Stiehm, president of Writers Guild of America West.
The WGA secured pay increases in each of the next three years, artificial intelligence restrictions and a new residual system for streaming based on viewership. The guild also negotiated higher contribution rates to health benefits and pensions, as well as a guaranteed number of writers in writers’ rooms for television shows.
The first productions to return after the strike ended were late-night heavyweights Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert, followed by John Oliver, host of “Last Week Tonight.”
Now it’s the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists’ turn. The actors guild began negotiations with the likes of Disney, Paramount, Netflix
, Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery last week.
“Until the studios make a deal that addresses the needs of performers, WGA members will be on the picket lines, walking side-by-side with SAG-AFTRA in solidarity,” said Lisa Takeuchi Cullen, president of Writers Guild of America East.
SAG-AFTRA is looking to improve wages, working conditions and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV. The guild is also looking to standardize the self-tape process.

Sarah Whitten,‘The Exorcist: Believer’ now faces its biggest foe: Taylor Swift,"In this article
“The Exorcist: Believer” possessed the box office during its opening weekend, but industry experts wonder if it will continue to turn heads in the weeks to come.
The Universal
and Blumhouse collaboration, the first of three planned films, tallied $26.5 million during its debut, making it the top-grossing film of the weekend. Yet that haul fell just shy of the $30 million prediction set by box office analysts. With international ticket sales, the film has generated $44 million.
Still, on a production budget of just $30 million, “The Exorcist: Believer” could prove profitable if it continues to lure moviegoers in the coming weeks.
There’s just one complication: Taylor Swift.
“The Exorcist: Believer” fled from its original release date (Oct. 13) because Swift announced her Eras Tour concert film would arrive in cinemas that day. The film quickly snared the coveted, higher priced, premium format screens, leaving little room for “The Exorcist: Believer” to eke out a solid opening.
“Moving from Friday the 13th to the 6th was a good move since the inherently strong marketing hook and advantage of having a horror movie opening on this classic day of superstitious importance would’ve likely been outweighed by the overwhelming dominance of that Swift film,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
Representatives for Universal declined to comment.
There was a brief notion that the two films could have partnered to become “Exorswift,” an opposites attract double feature like the summer’s “Barbenheimer” (“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer”). The potential same-day opening was almost immediately shut down when “The Exorcist: Believer” moved its release date up a week. Even producer Jason Blum, head of Blumhouse, was open to the idea.
Dergarabedian threw cold water on how well the combination would have worked, however.
“The notion that an ‘Exorswift’ mashup could have somehow been comparable to the ‘Barbenheimer’ phenomenon is patently absurd given the unlikelihood that legions of Swifties would have an interest in a very R-rated horror movie like ‘The Exorcist: Believer,’” he said. “Thus going all in on a head-to-head matchup with Swift might have proved disastrous.”
After all, Swift’s Eras Tour concert film is already a $100 million blockbuster — and that’s just from presales from AMC Entertainment cinemas which doesn’t include dozens of other theater chains’ sales.
In moving the week before Swift’s film opening, “The Exorcist: Believer” was able to control a higher number of premium screens and more audience attention. Around 34% of all theatrical foot traffic over the weekend was for the film, according to data from EntTelligence. Competition for that traffic included a new “Paw Patrol” film and a number of R-rated features like “Saw X,” “The Nun II,” “The Equalizer 3” and “Expend4bles.”
Box office analysts foresee a sharp drop in ticket sales from “The Exorcist: Believer’s” opening weekend to its second week. A decline is typical for horror movies, but Swift’s film will exacerbate it, the predict.
Word of mouth could also be a factor. Horror movies are usually review-proof, often performing well theatrically despite critical panning. As of Monday, “The Exorcist: Believer” holds a 22% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics and a 59% audience rating. With several more weeks before Halloween, the film could still pull in moviegoers looking for a fright.
There’s a good reason why Universal couldn’t take the risk on Exorswift. The studio badly needs “The Exorcist: Believer” and its planned sequels to be hits. (The next film, “The Exorcist: Deceiver,” is due April 2025.)
Universal and its streaming partner, Peacock, paid more than $400 million for the rights to The Exorcist brand. Through that investment, the studio has planned a trilogy of films. The company is also able to place previous Exorcist films on Peacock and integrate the IP in other ways, like Halloween Horror Nights at its domestic theme parks.
Still, no movie in the franchise, except for the original, has grossed more than $42 million domestically, according to Comscore. In fact, not counting “Believer,” all of the five sequels and prequels since the first movie have grossed under $150 million combined.
How “Exorcist” films have fared at the domestic box office:
Source: Comscore
*Special edition re-release of the original
“The Exorcist is not a brand or series that’s been prevalent in the pop culture consciousness for decades now, and its few sequels beforehand never lived up to the iconic box office run of the 1973 original,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “The industry may have gotten a little carried away in expecting a bigger run just because this Exorcist sequel has the Blumhouse name on it.”
“The Exorcist,” released on the day after Christmas in 1973, grossed $193 million domestically, and the “Version You’ve Never Seen” re-release, which featured additional scenes, scored $40 million in 2000.
Otherwise, the franchise is cursed at the box office. “Exorcist II,” which was made in 1977 without creator William Peter Blatty’s involvement, is widely considered one of the worst sequels ever made. Blatty, who died in 2017, wrote and directed 1990′s “The Exorcist III,” but he said the movie’s production company, Morgan Creek, forced him to severely compromise his vision. (The movie has since grown in stature among fans and critics.)
Then there was an ill-fated attempt to produce a prequel film in the 2000s that resulted in two wildly different movies. A generally well-regarded TV series ran on Fox for two seasons in 2016 and 2017, but it was canceled after a significant decline in ratings.
“Will the franchise have a higher ceiling in the years to come? That remains to be seen,” Robbins said. “It will largely come down to creative decisions and how the studios make an effort to attract modern horror audiences rather than leaning on a brand that a big portion of today’s moviegoers haven’t been regularly exposed to.”

Lillian Rizzo,"Nelson Peltz increases Disney stake, reignites potential proxy battle","In this article
A proxy battle between Nelson Peltz and Disney
is brewing for the second time this year.
Peltz’s activist firm, Trian Fund Management, has increased its stake in Disney to about 30 million shares, valued at roughly $2.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The stake makes Trian one of the largest shareholders in Disney.
The move comes less than a year after Peltz dropped his initial proxy fight with Disney, and days after the company’s stock reached a 52-week-low.
The firm plans to push for multiple seats on the board this time, including one for Peltz, the people said. Earlier this year, the firm sought only a spot for Peltz.
The nomination window for new board members opens on Dec. 5 and runs until Jan. 4, according to public filings. If Disney rejects Trian’s proposal, the firm could nominate directors during the open window to be voted on at the company’s annual meeting in spring 2024.
A Disney representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Peltz increased his Disney stake.
It’s been nearly a year since Bob Iger returned as Disney’s CEO. The company has struggled to make its streaming unit profitable and has announced other initiatives to turn around its business.
Iger has opened the door to selling some of Disney’s assets, particularly its TV networks business. He has also considered looking for an investor in sports channel ESPN.
“After coming back, I realized the company is facing a lot of challenges, some of them self-inflicted,” Iger told CNBC’s David Faber in July.
Iger managed to ward off Peltz in February after the company unveiled a vast restructuring plan that included cost cuts and 7,000 layoffs. Disney said it would slash $5.5 billion in costs, consisting of $3 billion from content, excluding sports, and another $2.5 billion from non-content costs.
When Trian launched its proxy fight in January, the firm had owned about 9.4 million shares valued at roughly $900 million. Peltz had criticized Disney’s $71 billion acquisition of Fox in 2019, its failed succession planning and what he called “weak corporate governance” over the years that has depleted shareholder value.
It’s unclear if Trian has any specific operational ideas for Disney that Iger hasn’t already proposed or has privately rejected. Trian released a slide presentation in January showcasing Disney’s stock underperformance and the activist fund’s own track record of improving corporate valuation.
The fund spent several slides noting how Disney’s acquisition of the majority of 21st Century Fox’s assets has failed to generate a return for shareholders.
Trian also focused on Disney’s inability to find a successor for Iger. The Disney board and Iger have been vetting succession candidates since Iger returned to the CEO job in November, according to people familiar with the matter, and have targeted early 2025 as a logical time to set up that transition.
In July, Disney extended Iger’s contract by another two years to 2026. The succession process has remained a key issue for the company and its leader. Iger returned to Disney following a fallout with Bob Chapek, has handpicked successor."
Leslie Josephs,"Airlines cancel Israel flights, tours scramble to change trips after attacks","Several airlines have suspended service to Israel after surprise attacks by Hamas and Israeli retaliation left hundreds dead and thousands injured.
State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday that nine U.S. citizens were killed. Some U.S. citizens are still unaccounted for “and we are working with our Israeli partners to determine their whereabouts,” he said.
A National Security Council spokesperson said that the U.S. is not “actively” considering an evacuation of U.S. citizens.
Meanwhile the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday sent a notice to pilots stating “operators are advised to exercise extreme caution when operating” in the Tel Aviv area because of the attacks.
United Airlines
, Delta Air Lines
and American Airlines
each scrubbed service to Tel Aviv.
Delta said Monday that it would suspend its nonstop flights to and from Tel Aviv through at least the end of October and said it will work with customers to get them out of Israel through partner airlines.
United Flight 954, which departed San Francisco Friday night for Israel, turned back near Greenland, according to flight-tracker FlightAware.
“Our Tel Aviv flights will remain suspended until conditions allow them to resume,” United said on Sunday.
American flights scheduled for early this week were also canceled.
Germany-based Lufthansa Group said all of its flights, including those on Swiss International Air Lines and Austrian Airlines, were suspended into Tel Aviv.
Swiss International Air Lines is planning to send an Airbus A321 with seating for 219 passengers to Tel Aviv on Tuesday in coordination with the Swiss government “intended to offer Swiss nationals in Israel the opportunity of a prompt return to their home country.”
All scheduled commercial service on the airline is canceled through at least Saturday.
“We regret having to do so,” the airline said in a statement. “We are monitoring developments closely and remain in close contact with the relevant authorities.”
British Airways
also canceled flights this weekend and reduced service early in the week. Air France said its Tel Aviv service was canceled “until further notice,” while European budget airlines Wizz
and easyJet
canceled flights to Tel Aviv through at least Monday.
Israeli airline El Al said Sunday that its flights were “operated as scheduled” and said it was expanding its schedule to help offset the cancellations. Emirates Airline also continued to operate flights between Tel Aviv to Dubai, and Turkish Airlines flew between Tel Aviv and Istanbul.
El Al and other carriers also offered travel waivers for customers to delay or cancel their trips.
Cruise operator Royal Caribbean
said it adjusted several itineraries to bypass the area because of the attacks. “Impacted guests are being notified directly,” the company said in a statement.
Some tour operators worked to get travelers out of the country quickly.
Nadav Peretz, founder of OUTstanding Travel, a Tel Aviv-based tour company that caters to the LGBTQ+ community, said he had more than 30 clients in the country at the time of the attacks and that customers quickly found flights out of the country and were refunded for the rest of their trips.
“Unfortunately, we had to send people back to the airport after two or three days of their trip,” Peretz said by phone.
Intrepid Travel said it “had a small number” of travelers in the country when the attacks began on Saturday and that all guides and customers are accounted for.
Zina Bencheikh, managing director of Intrepid Travel’s Middle East and Africa business, said that the company’s customers who were in the middle of a tour in Israel during the attacks had mostly left the country, with the exception of one who was set to leave on Monday.
The company canceled its tours in Israel through the end of the month."
Laya Neelakandan,Cruise prices are way up as operators meet surging travel demand,"In this article
As vacationers emerge into a post-pandemic travel world, cruises have made a spectacular comeback — and ticket prices are surging.
Cruise operators such as Carnival
and Royal Caribbean Cruises
are setting some ticket prices higher than pre-pandemic levels and are indicating they may raise them further, even as they post pre-Covid profits.
According to data from Cruise Critic, a cruise review site owned by Tripadvisor, the average price of a five-night cruise in the Caribbean for December of this year is $736, roughly 37% higher than the average price a year earlier. Compared to 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic decimated the cruising industry, December ticket prices are up 43%.
Carnival CEO Josh Weinstein said during a call with Wall Street analysts at the end of September that the company’s third-quarter net revenue per passenger per day reached a record high. The company’s booking volumes likewise hit an all-time high, pushing cruise occupancy and revenue beyond 2019 levels, he said.
Especially as costs of labor, food and fuel continue to rise, Carnival executives noted on the call, the company, which owns multiple major cruise brands, is “well-positioned to drive 2024 pricing higher.”
A Carnival spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s specific future pricing actions but said in a statement to CNBC that the company has been able to deliver a value of 25% to 50% over “comparable land-based vacation alternatives.”
Carnival sees “ample headroom” to close that gap, the spokesperson said.
Royal Caribbean CEO Jason Liberty echoed the sentiment, saying on that company’s post-earnings call in July that his company is also considering increasing prices to meet the surge in demand.
Aaron Saunders, a senior editor at Cruise Critic, said part of what’s driving the price surge is the comparison to high airfares.
As inflation surges, airfare tickets have reached sky-high prices, with international airfare up 26% from 2019, according to an August estimate by fare-tracking company Hopper.
With travelers facing higher costs across the broader sector, and considering cruises typically include additional amenities such as meals and entertainment, consumers are likely to gravitate in that direction, Saunders said.
That demand is being driven by both seasoned cruisers and first timers, he said, a dynamic the industry hasn’t historically seen much of. Even so, Saunders said he believes the high prices might be here to stay.
″[The higher prices] are likely subject to fluctuation — but what we’re seeing, generally speaking, is that the higher prices are here today, but those higher prices will ping pong around throughout different sectors,” Saunders said, noting that the Caribbean market is currently one of the most popular sectors. “Cruise lines aren’t being required to drop prices the way they used to … they’re just simply not having to lower fares or to really offer too many incentives because people are just booking.”
Truist Securities analyst Patrick Scholes said while rising oil prices are important to monitor for context for the cruise industry, there’s not enough of a correlation between that increase and the increase in cruise prices to explain the propped-up tickets.
“They’re raising prices naturally — fuel or no fuel, the demand is there for them to be raising prices,” Scholes said.
While in a pre-pandemic world, last-minute bookings meant cheaper deals to secure a cabin, Scholes said, the prices are now so high that they’ll only increase more as the vacation date nears.
For now, the record-high ticket prices show no signs of slowing, according to Ashley Kosciolek, senior cruise writer at The Points Guy. Kosciolek noted that the industry is also seeing higher prices for beverage packages and add-on amenities that used to be included in fares.
“Let’s also not forget that the industry’s three largest parent companies — Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings
— are still paying off billions in debt incurred during the pandemic,” she said."
Brandon Gomez,"Hispanic inclusion in corporate America lagged in 2022, new survey finds","Hispanic inclusion in corporate America lagged last year, particularly in three key areas — C-suite representation, talent development and supplier procurement — according to the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility’s 2023 Corporate Inclusion Index.
While Hispanics make up 18% of the U.S. workforce, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they are overrepresented in nonexempt positions, which represent 73% of the Hispanic workforce according to HACR’s research.
Nonexempt positions often offer fewer benefits, limited autonomy and fewer advancement opportunities, which can stifle the ability of Hispanic workers to advance within companies.
″There’s no precise way to define success in the case of these things,” said Lisette Garcia, HACR chief research officer. “It’s more about ensuring that people feel engaged and committed and valued and that their voice matters, but that’s where benchmarking and doing these surveys matter.”
The corporate advocacy group’s annual report, which measures Hispanic inclusion in employment, procurement, governance and philanthropy, was provided exclusively to CNBC ahead of its wider release.
It includes data from 92 companies — many within the Fortune 500 — collected between January and April.
A key finding from HACR: The lack of representation typically begins right at the start of the pipeline.
While all companies that participated in the survey reported offering internship programs, only 13% of interns in 2022 identified as Hispanic.
Garcia clarified that number may in reality be higher since demographic data collection around interns isn’t always conducted.
While the vast majority of companies say they prioritize “mentorship” and “succession planning initiatives,” at 91% and 97% of respondents, respectively, almost one-third of companies said they do not have clearly defined goals or metrics to evaluate the success of internal talent development and program success.
“One way of combatting issues related to Hispanic inclusion in corporate America is investments in internship programs as a way of attracting new employees,” HACR noted in its report.
Hispanic representation on corporate boards was even more troubling, according to the findings. Just 7% of board seats at respondent companies were held by Hispanics according to HACR, and only 2% of seats were held by Latinas.
Almost half the companies surveyed had no Hispanic board directors.
As for supplier diversity, HACR found fewer than 1% of companies supplying to survey respondents were Hispanic in 2022, and just slightly more than 1% of total spend was with Hispanic-owned businesses.
Garcia also noted those results amount to best estimates, not perfect numbers, since companies aren’t required to collect demographic information for their supplier pool. She also shared in her research that the companies collecting this data and sharing their results are often those committed to leading the charge.
“Companies who really understand the value of this work for their business bottom line are going to be the ones that keep moving forward,” she said. “The sheer numbers of population growth and buying power tell us that companies aren’t going to really have a choice.”
While Hispanic inclusion lagged, HACR noted survey participation was up 12%, offering hope for future improvement.
“In spite of everything that’s happening in society at large with attacks on DEI work and attacks on marginalized people in the United States, we’re seeing companies be interested in benchmarking,” said Garcia.
“There’s this renewed interest in saying, ‘Hey, where am I? What do I need to do to get better,’ and for me, that’s all I need to hear.”
Disclosure: CNBC’s parent company Comcast is among the companies that participated in HACR’s annual survey."
Lillian Rizzo,"For U.S. investors seeking an edge in European soccer, the cheaper the better","For U.S. investors looking to score an investment in a European soccer club, some of the focus is shifting toward the clubs with lower valuations and typically not in the marquee tier of the sport overseas.
Some investors, particularly in the U.S., are shifting toward a so-called multi-club model, or investing in smaller clubs with lower valuations, as they try to take a piece of the international sports market at smaller deal valuations.
This comes as deep-pocketed investors — from top U.S. private equity and venture capital firms to global rivals like sovereign wealth funds — have intensified competition.
“In terms of private equity and high net worth individuals, soccer is more of a global sport than almost any U.S. sport,” said Charles Baker, co-chair of law firm Sidley’s entertainment, sports and media group. “There are huge populations that can be accessed — in both the regions they play in and the world.”
That global nature of soccer fans — and the growing popularity in the U.S. — often translates into higher revenue opportunities from broadcast media rights deals to merchandising.
The owners behind clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea FC and Newcastle have seen revenue multiples step up, and in many cases valuations have doubled, PitchBook noted in a report that concluded most clubs would sell at a premium.
Deal valuations across the top five European soccer leagues have exploded from more than $70 million in 2018 to roughly $5.2 billion in 2022, according PitchBook. Meanwhile, more than one-third of the clubs in the so-called “Big Five” leagues in Europe are backed by U.S. investors, including private equity and venture capital firms.
The spike in 2022 came from a consortium led by U.S. investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital acquiring the English Premier League’s Chelsea for more than $5 billion, as well as RedBird Capital Partners’ takeover of Italy’s AC Milan from Elliott Management for nearly $1.3 billion.
“These recent transactions have set a precedent in terms of club valuation but also prompted many owners to consider selling to [private equity],” according to an analyst report from PitchBook.
Some firms, like Sixth Street Partners, have found different outlets into taking a stake in European soccer, particularly in Spain’s LaLiga. The firm acquired a stake in the Spanish broadcast rights of FC Barcelona, the former longtime home of superstar Lionel Messi, and also paid about $380 million for a stake in Real Madrid’s stadium operations.
The shift is happening as soccer clubs have been looking for fresh capital following the distress stemming from the earlier days of the Covid pandemic. Revenue decreased as coronavirus restrictions kept fans out of the stands and costs rose, which led to an opening for more U.S. investors to take a stake in the increasingly popular global sport.
Last month, U.S. investor Fenway Sports Group sold a minority stake in Liverpool FC to Dynasty Equity, in a move to help it pay down debt stemming from the pandemic and costs from upgrading the team’s home field and buying high-profile players.
Various English Premier League clubs have been reportedly open to discussions with buyers, including recently Sheffield United and Manchester United.
This has led some U.S. investors to find creative ways into the European sports market.
Lower tier leagues like England’s Championship League and League One are attractive plays at smaller valuations, and each have teams open to buyers and investors, noted Neil Barlow, an attorney at Clifford Chance.
“One thing to be mindful of is relegation — it’s taken PE firms and other financial buyers a bit of time to get more comfortable with that. At the same time, they understand the upside of promotion,” said Baker. In soccer, teams face relegation to lower leagues if they have a disappointing season.
Irwin Raij, also co-chair of law firm Sidley’s entertainment, sports and media group, said the firm has seen plenty of investors with business plans to take lower tier teams to a higher level through investment. “It sounds easier than it is to implement. We’ve seen interest from a broad variety of investors in that space,” Raij said.
There’s also rising interest in other teams across Europe, letting U.S. middle-market investors snap up multiple teams and move toward a so-called “multi-club” model.
Valuations across these teams are typically in line with each other. It also allows for a model in which players can be transferred throughout the various clubs owned by the same investor, building up their talent and potentially being sold to a higher league — similar to the minor leagues in the U.S.
Through this method, investors “can find synergies between comparable clubs,” either on the same continent or across the globe, while also leveraging governance, technology and data sharing between the clubs, Barlow said.
“It’s a strategy a lot of other U.S.-based investors are circling around deploying,” Barlow said.
City Football Club is a multi-club outfit that includes Abu Dhabi United Group as its majority investor. It’s also backed by U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake, and Chinese investors hold a small stake.
City Football Club owns the Premier League’s powerhouse and recent champion Manchester City, as well as Major League Soccer’s New York City Football Club and Australia’s Melbourne City.
But as larger private equity firms chase the top teams, middle-market firms are looking to raise funds to chase the multi-club strategy, Barlow noted.
One U.S. firm that has been using this strategy is 777 Partners.
The Florida-based company recently agreed to buy a majority stake in the Premier League’s Everton for a reported $685 million, after building its portfolio with other European soccer clubs in the past few years.
In 2018, the firm took a stake in the Spain’s Sevilla FC, and followed suit with investments in clubs in various countries from Genoa C.F.C. in Italy and Red Star FC in France to clubs in Brazil and Australia.

Michael Wayland,UAW Mack Trucks union members to join striking Detroit autoworkers on picket lines after voting down tentative deal,"In this article
DETROIT – About 3,900 United Auto Workers members with Mack Trucks will go on strike Monday after a majority of members rejected a tentative agreement reached last week by the union and company.
The tentative agreement was voted down by 73% of UAW members who voted, the union said Sunday night. Workers at facilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Florida will strike starting at 7 a.m. Monday, UAW announced online.
The Mack Trucks workers will add to tens of thousands of other striking UAW members, most notably more than 25,000 employees with General Motors
, Ford Motor
and Stellantis
. The union launched targeted strikes at select facilities against the Detroit automakers beginning Sept. 15. The union’s since expanded the strikes at each of the automakers.
The Mack Trucks deal was viewed as a potential test of the willingness of workers to ratify a deal that didn’t meet raised expectations set by UAW President Shawn Fain for record contracts for hourly pay increases, equal pay for equal work, inflation protection and shorter work weeks.
The tentative deal with Volvo Group
-owned Mack Trucks fell significantly short of what the union is demanding in negotiations currently being held with the Detroit automakers, leading some workers last week to tell CNBC that they would vote against the deal.
One Mack Trucks worker descried the deal as “disgraceful” and an “insult” compared to their expectations and what’s currently being negotiated by UAW international leaders with the Detroit automakers, also known as the Big Three.
“We are low man on totem pole, and we are getting no backing from international,” said a more than 10-year material technician on Friday. “They are just pushing this [tentative agreement] through so they don’t have to deal with us while the Big Three are negotiating.”
While Mack Trucks is a separate company and a different part of the union than the section that covers members with the Detroit automakers, some workers were expecting that they would receive similar increases and benefits as their union brethren at the Detroit automakers.
The Mack Trucks tentative agreement varies by location and job but for many workers, it includes a roughly 19% wage increase over the five-year deal, including 10% upon ratification; $3,500 ratification bonuses; increased 401(k) company payments; and other benefits. It does not include the elimination of wage tiers (it only has a one-year reduction that would bring the steps to five years); re-instatement of traditional pensions; cost-of-living adjustments to battle inflation; or shorter work weeks.
Demands by UAW negotiators with the Detroit automakers have included 40% pay increase, inflation protection in the form of cost-of-living allowances (COLA), work/life balance and other bonuses and benefits.
Fain, who has publicly laid out the demands for Detroit autoworkers, said COLA, job security, wage progression and a host of other topics as outstanding issues in the talks with Mack Trucks.
“The members have spoken, and as the highest authority in our union, they have the final word,” Fain said Sunday in a message released by the union. He said the union “remains committed to exploring all options for reaching an agreement, but clearly we are not there yet.”
Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy said the company is “surprised and disappointed that the UAW has chosen to strike, which we feel is unnecessary.”
“We are committed to the collective bargaining process, and remain confident that we will be able to arrive at an agreement that delivers competitive wages and benefits for our employees and their families, while safeguarding our future as a competitive company and stable long-term employer. We look forward to returning to negotiations as soon as possible,” he said Sunday night in a release."
Stefan Sykes,U.S. drinkers are flocking to Mexican brands — here’s what’s driving growth,"People in the U.S. are drinking less alcohol than they used to, but when they do indulge, they’re more likely than ever to opt for a beverage originating from Mexico.
The U.S. is the largest market for Mexico’s agave-based spirits and its top beers. In recent years, Mexican brands have begun to dominate the U.S. alcoholic beverages industry as drinkers develop a thirst for premium-priced products with authentic backstories.
Last year, Mexico’s native agave-based spirits tequila and mezcal overtook American whiskey to become the second-fastest growing spirits category by revenue and volume within the U.S., according to analysis by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, an industry trade association. In 2022 alone, nearly 30 million 9 liter cases of tequila and mezcal were sold in the U.S.
Experts say the segment is poised to pass vodka in 2023 to become the country’s fastest-growing spirits category in terms of volume.

“Tequila has been such a national treasure here in Mexico,” said Guilherme Espagnoli Martins, global brand director of Diageo-owned Don Julio Tequila. “Now, it’s breaking through geographies and flying to other countries as well.”
“It’s putting Mexico on the map,” he said.
The rise of Mexican alcoholic beverages into the mainstream U.S., more than 20 years in the making, is the result of authentic, savvy marketing aimed at making Mexican brands palatable to consumers outside of the brands’ home country, while still resonating with their traditional market.
Other factors driving the higher sales include consumers’ increasing willingness to spend more on higher-quality products across wine, spirits and beer.
The growth of tequila and mezcal in particular has been propelled by sales of premium or high-end brands such as Casamigos and Don Julio, which are priced higher at retail and are produced with 100% agave, without flavoring or additives.
The George Clooney-founded Casamigos, which came into the market a decade ago and paved the way for other celebrity-owned premium tequilas, is so far this year’s top-selling tequila across the alcohol e-commerce site Drizly, a Drizly spokesperson told CNBC. Don Julio was the second.
Since 2003, the tequila and mezcal category in the U.S. overall grew 273% in volumes, or at an average rate of 7.2% per year, while premium agave-based spirits skyrocketed 1,522%, DISCUS found. All the products driving the tequila boom originate from Mexico. While some brands such as Casamigos are based outside the country, the spirit legally has to be produced there.
Don Julio, a more than 80-year-old Mexican business now owned by British spirits giant Diageo, is rebranding and finding fresh success amid the new wave of appreciation for tequila. Martins said Don Julio’s smooth taste, versatility and perception as a purer, cleaner spirit has boosted the product.
This year-end, the brand saw double-digit growth in global sales and is up 20% in 2023 compared to last year, a spokesperson told CNBC. Last month, it debuted a new look and promotional film as it seeks to replicate the success it has had in the U.S. overseas.
“As we take this brand global, there is a huge responsibility for us to put modern Mexico on the world stage,” Martins said of the campaign.
It’s not just tequila and mezcal — Mexican beer is booming, too.
Mexican beer imports into the U.S. are up 10.6% in 2023, according to alcohol research firm Bump Williams Consulting.
Earlier this year, Mexico’s Modelo Especial became the best-selling beer in the U.S., dethroning Bud Light, which held the top spot since 2001.
“Once [the beer’s owner] Constellation got their hands on Modelo, the company was really able to step up marketing investment and drive tremendous growth,” said TD Cowen analyst Vivien Azer.
Constellation Brands
acquired Modelo in 2013 following an antitrust deal that blocked rival Anheuser-Busch InBev
from buying the brand. Its rise to the top started before the conservative boycott against AB InBev’s Bud Light that began this spring.
Modelo, along with Constellation’s Corona Extra, has benefited from the U.S.′ steadily growing Hispanic population, Azer said. But the company sought growth outside of Hispanic drinkers as well.
“It was a deliberate strategy by Constellation to diversify away from Hispanic consumers and toward a wider market,” said Azer.
A spokesperson for Constellation told CNBC that Mexican beer sales grew as Hispanic culture gained a stronger foothold around the world.
“The popularity of Mexican beers can in part be tied to the Hispanic population growth and influence on culture,” the spokesperson said. “Younger generations are increasingly bicultural and Latin culture has had a huge impact on the mainstream.”
Constellation on Thursday reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates, driven by the surge in demand for its Mexican beer brands.
The companies behind the lagers’ growth also attributed their success to a simple factor: taste. Mexican beers are “very easy to drink,” said Jonnie Cahill, chief marketing officer at Heineken USA, which distributes the Mexican beers Dos Equis and Tecate.
Cahill said that not only are Mexican beers riding on the tailwinds of changing consumer preferences toward lighter-tasting, more expensive imported lagers, but also the category has been lifted by “authentic” marketing, such as the pairing of lime and beer, which is played up in advertisements, at bars and for holidays such as Cinco de Mayo.
“We focus on authentic Mexican flavors whenever we innovate and we avoid randomness, because that’s the opportunism that people often reject,” Cahill said of Heineken’s Dos Equis brand, which peaked in the mid-2000s with its iconic The Most Interesting Man in the World campaign.
It’s a competitive space, admitted Cahill. Sales for Dos Equis have declined in recent years. In the week ending Sept. 9, Dos Equis retail sales off premise were down 1.7%, while Modelo and Corona were up 10.6% and 3.3% respectively, according to Bump Williams Consulting.
Cahill said the brand is trying to ramp up distribution across the U.S. in hopes of competing with rivals.
Eduardo “Lalo” González grew up in the agave fields where his grandfather Don Julio began a tequila empire that would reach all parts of the world.
“I always had this dream and this idea of continuing this legacy of my family,” said González. “Believe it or not, there’s a lack of Mexican ownership in tequila brands.”
Diageo acquired Don Julio in 2015. In 2020, González launched LALO Tequila, a blanco tequila free of flavors or additives and made with 100% agave distilled in González’s home region of Jalisco, just one of five Mexican states where tequila can be legally produced.
“It’s all about embracing family and embracing legacy and embracing traditions,” González said, as the brand begins to find its footing in the U.S. “We’re building our own story by honoring our ancestors, and also by bringing people into our culture.”
What’s next for the category?
Tequila and mezcal prices may increase as American demand continues to surge and the agave plant suffers some shortages, said González. Agave takes about seven years to grow and can only be planted in certain Mexican regions.
González said more farmers have begun harvesting the succulent as the industry plants the seeds for similar growth in overseas markets."
Annika Kim Constantino,"Novavax’s updated Covid vaccine can still catch up to Pfizer, Moderna shots","In this article
Americans can finally get their hands on Novavax
’s newest Covid vaccine after U.S. regulators greenlighted the shot this week.
The vaccine’s arrival comes nearly three weeks after new jabs from Pfizer
and Moderna
reached the public, and after more than 4 million patients rolled up their sleeves to get a shot in September. But Wall Street analysts aren’t worried about that delay.
They said Novavax appears well positioned to catch up and compete this fall with the other companies in the U.S. Covid vaccine market, particularly after logistical issues hampered the rollout of the other shots and a Food and Drug Administration label that allows for wide accessibility to Novavax’s jab, among other factors.
“I’m really not concerned about the timeline or lag relative to the other shots,” B. Riley Securities analyst Mayank Mamtani told CNBC. He added that regulators cleared Novavax’s new shot only slightly later than what the company had estimated, which was late in the third quarter.
That’s good news for Novavax, which is working to strengthen its financial position after raising doubts about its ability to stay in business at the beginning of the year. The biotech company is banking on sales of its updated Covid vaccine — its only commercially available product — and a broad cost-cutting push to help it stay afloat. 
Public health officials see Novavax’s vaccine as a valuable alternative for people who don’t want to take messenger RNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna, which teach cells how to make proteins that trigger an immune response against Covid. Novavax’s shot fends off the virus with protein-based technology, a decades-old method used in routine vaccinations against hepatitis B and shingles.
Silvia Taylor, Novavax’s chief corporate affairs and advocacy officer, told CNBC that the company has collected data showing that 25% to 30% of people prefer a protein-based vaccine.
“We look forward to meeting this demand and more in the wake of new variants and rising COVID cases,” Taylor said in a statement.
Shares of Novavax jumped more than 10% on Tuesday after the FDA cleared its new shot. But the company’s stock is still down more than 25% year to date after shedding more than 90% of its value last year.
The FDA authorized Novavax’s updated vaccine — which targets the omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 — for emergency use in people ages 12 and older. Patients previously vaccinated with an older Covid vaccine are eligible to receive one dose of Novavax’s new jab, while unvaccinated people can receive two doses, according to the authorization.
The FDA similarly approved the new shots from Pfizer and Moderna for people ages 12 and older, but the agency also authorized those vaccines for emergency use in children ages 6 months through 11 years old.
Still, Mamtani said the authorization label for Novavax’s new vaccine is “broad and without any notable restrictions for the first time,” which will likely make the shot as widely accessible to teens and adults as the new mRNA jabs. That puts Novavax on more of a level playing field with Pfizer and Moderna this fall, even as a late entrant to the game.
The label for Novavax’s last Covid booster was far more restrictive. Last year, the FDA authorized it as a first booster dose for people ages 18 and older who couldn’t receive a new mRNA shot for accessibility or clinical reasons. That “basically disqualified a lot of people” from getting it last fall, according to Mamtani. 
“Finally, after three years, Novavax has a label that puts its vaccine at parity with the mRNA shots,” Mamtani said. “I think the most powerful words on that label was that people can get it regardless of their previous Covid vaccination history.” 
Novavax’s vaccine is entering the market after Pfizer and Moderna had a bumpy start to the rollout of their shots. Insurance and supply-related issues left many Americans unable to find or access the new mRNA vaccines for free, which may give Novavax an opportunity to catch up and get more people to take its shot. 
“We know that a lot of people have tried to get an mRNA vaccine, but they aren’t able to because of logistical challenges of access and distribution,” Jefferies analyst Roger Song told CNBC. “So, that’s one reason why the two or three weeks delay won’t necessarily be a hurdle for Novavax.” 
There’s no way of knowing whether the rollout of Novavax’s new shot will see similar logistical snags or if it will have a smoother launch. The federal government shifted Covid vaccine distribution and coverage to the private market for the first time this fall. That has proved to be a tricky transition for the U.S. health-care system. 
However, health-care providers and pharmacies have signaled that they are ironing out logistical issues and will be better equipped to handle them in the future.
Last week, a group of insurers told the Biden administration they were “largely, if not completely,” done with fixing delays in insurance coverage for the new Covid shots. Those delays had resulted in some patients getting charged up to $190 for a shot at pharmacies.
“Should further issues arise, we stand ready to swiftly implement system improvements,” the insurers said in a letter. 
Some pharmacies, like Walgreens
, also appear to be resolving supply disruptions, which left many stores without any new Covid shots for patients to receive.
What’s more, Novavax’s new shot might actually be arriving at just the right time: a month before Covid vaccine demand is expected to peak in the U.S. this fall and winter. 
Jefferies’ Song said the peak could follow a similar pattern as last season when most Covid boosters were administered in November. That’s partly because there is “less urgency” among Americans when it comes to Covid shots compared to early on in the pandemic, which could cause them to get vaccinated later rather than earlier.
“During the first season of Covid, everyone rushed to get vaccinations because it was really an emergency state. But now people have a mindset where they’re saying, ‘OK, I will wait and see how bad Covid really gets,’” Song said.
By November, Novavax’s new shot will likely be as widely available as shots from Pfizer and Moderna at pharmacies, doctor’s offices and other vaccine distribution sites. 
But the biggest uncertainty this fall for all three companies is how many Americans will decide to get another Covid vaccine, Song said.
Last year’s uptake was already feeble: Only about 17% of the U.S. population — around 56 million people — received last year’s boosters, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“We don’t know how big the overall pie will be because we’ve never been in a commercial market for Covid vaccines,” he told CNBC. “This fall will set a new benchmark for the entire Covid vaccine space.”"
Michael Wayland,UAW Mack Trucks workers to vote on deal amid heightened expectations,"In this article
DETROIT — United Auto Workers members with Volvo Group
-owned Mack Trucks will vote this weekend on a tentative agreement that falls significantly short of what the union is demanding in negotiations currently being held with Detroit automakers.
The Sunday vote by roughly 3,900 union members could test the willingness of workers to ratify a lesser deal compared to raised expectations set by UAW President Shawn Fain for hourly pay increases, equal pay for equal work, inflation protection and, potentially, shorter work weeks.
While Mack Trucks is a separate company and a different part of the union than the section that covers members with General Motors
, Ford Motor
and Stellantis
, some workers were expecting that they would receive similar increases and benefits as their union brethren at the Detroit automakers.
“In my opinion, the master contract is not horrid. It’s not a bad contract, but it’s nowhere near what we were expecting,” a 12-year Mack Truck worker at the company’s Lehigh Valley Operations in Pennsylvania told CNBC.
The worker and several other UAW members with Mack Trucks who asked not to be identified due to fear of retribution from the union or company said they plan to vote against the deal. Their reasons included the tentative agreement not meeting expectations, the length of the deal being a year longer than before and the pay increases and bonuses not being enough to offset inflation or reward them for working through the Covid-19 pandemic.
“When we were going in, we were following basically like the automakers,” the worker said. “They’ve changed some things for the better but, in my opinion, not enough.”
The Mack Trucks tentative agreement varies by location and job but for many workers, it includes a roughly 19% wage increase over the five-year deal, including 10% upon ratification; $3,500 ratification bonuses; increased 401(k) company payments; and other benefits. It does not include the elimination of wage tiers (it only has a one-year reduction that would bring the steps to five years); re-instatement of traditional pensions; cost-of-living adjustments to battle inflation; or shorter work weeks.
The Mack Trucks tentative agreement isn’t a bad deal, but it’s not close to the 40% pay increase, inflation protection, work/life balance and other bonuses and benefits Fain has set as the standard for negotiations with the Detroit automakers. For the Detroit automakers, pay tiers also have been at least cut in half from eight years — a time frame Fain, a former auto worker, said Friday was “not acceptable.”
Mack Trucks and UAW announced the tentative agreement early Monday, followed by releasing “highlights” of the deal later in the week to members. Neither UAW nor Mack Trucks have publicly released the tentative contract ahead of employee meetings to detail the agreement and voting this weekend. 
Another Mack Trucks worker descried the deal as “disgraceful” and an “insult” compared to their expectations and what’s currently being negotiated by UAW international leaders with the Detroit automakers, also known as the Big Three.
“We are low man on totem pole, and we are getting no backing from international,” said a more than 10-year material technician. “They are just pushing this [tentative agreement] through so they don’t have to deal with us while the Big Three are negotiating.”
UAW declined to comment on the comparison in contracts between Mack Trucks and the Detroit automakers. Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy, in a Monday statement, said the tentative agreement “would deliver significantly increased wages and continue first-class benefits for Mack employees and their families,” while keeping the company competitive.
Another veteran worker at Mack Truck’s Lehigh Valley Operations in Pennsylvania said they were not expecting the same raises and benefits as what’s being negotiated with the Detroit automakers, but they were looking for more than what’s in the current tentative agreement.
“We pay dues just like the Big Three,” said the roughly 20-year Mack Trucks employee who has worked several positions with the company. “We should get at least the same type of negotiation options.”
One of the “options” mentioned by Mack Truck workers was conducting target strikes like what’s happening at the Detroit automakers to fight for additional wages and benefits, specifically, the reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments to combat inflation.
“My honest opinion, I thought we were going out on strike because there’s no COLA in it,” the worker said. So, in five years, we’re going to be right back in the same hole.”
Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who specializes in labor issues, said it’s important to note that Mack Trucks is not in the same position as the Detroit automakers. However, inflated expectations from union members can be a problem.
“The UAW can be a victim of its own success,” he said. “They get a good deal here and everybody’s going to say we want the same thing … but they operate in different industries or different segments of the larger industry that have different financial considerations, and I think that’s just what you’re seeing here.”"
Alex Sherman,The NBA can shift the balance of power in media with its next rights deal,"In this article
The National Basketball Association’s upcoming decision on which companies will acquire the TV and streaming rights for its live games could transform the entire media industry.
Based on preliminary discussions between media executives and league officials, Comcast
’s NBCUniversal, Google
’s YouTube TV, Amazon
, Apple
and even Netflix
may challenge or join the incumbents as rights holders, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Spokespeople at NBCUniversal, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and Netflix declined to comment.
Every media rights renewal for the NBA is an important event because it only happens about once a decade. The last rights deal was announced in 2014. The NBA’s current rights deal ends after the 2024-25 season.
All expressions of interest between media partners and the NBA have been preliminary because league officials can’t officially negotiate with interested partners until April, when the league’s exclusive negotiating window with incumbent media rights partners Disney
and Warner Bros. Discovery
ends.
But with the National Football League’s media rights locked up until 2033, the NBA has a unique opportunity to play media kingmaker. Live sports have continuously increased in value for decades as advertisers clamor for live events where commercials can’t be skipped. The NBA will likely get a significant increase on its new media deal. Former ESPN head John Skipper predicted earlier this year the league could get between 200% and 350% more in its new agreement.
“Our next set of media deals will help shape the future of our league and how fans consume NBA basketball for years to come,” an NBA spokesperson said.
Netflix’s potential interest in the NBA could be industry-shaking. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos has repeatedly said Netflix hasn’t encountered a viable path to carrying live sports that would appeal to its shareholders.
“We’ve not seen a profit path to renting big sports,” he said in December.
But Sarandos has recently softened his stance from disinterest in the NBA to potential interest, according to people familiar with the matter. What that means is still unknown. It’s unlikely the NBA would hand over its largest package of streaming games to a provider that’s never had experience with live sports, said the people.
Netflix has contemplated buying sports rights before. The world’s largest streamer unsuccessfully bid for live Formula 1 racing rights last year.
But the biggest change for Netflix is the company’s push to add customers to its advertising-supported tier, which launched in November. About 5 million subscribers had signed up for its ad tier, which costs $6.99 per month, Netflix announced in May.
Netflix said earlier this year it makes more money off subscribers who select the cheaper ad-supported tier than its $15.49 standard tier, which doesn’t include advertising. The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for the advertising tier would likely rise even more if Netflix added a package of NBA games, which would command premium-priced ad rates unlike anything currently on Netflix’s service.
Disney and Amazon have also adjusted their streaming offerings to account for the media industry’s recent revelation that there’s enough digital advertising demand to push ARPU just as high as or even higher than their higher-priced no-ad subscription products. Disney is increasing its ad-free pricing on Disney+ by 27% later this month while keeping the price of ad-supported Disney+ stagnant. Amazon plans to inject commercials into its previously ad-free Prime Video in 2024.
The NBA would be a particularly valuable addition to an ad-supported streaming service because its season runs from October to June, including playoffs. That’s an effective churn reducer for fans, who won’t be able to binge-watch a season of live games like they do with on-demand entertainment series.
Netflix sells an ad-supported plan in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
That global reach is appealing for the NBA, which features an assortment of international stars, including Slovenian Luka Dončić of the Dallas Mavericks, Serbian Nikola Jokić of the NBA champion Denver Nuggets and French rookie Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs.
It’s also possible the league could decide to maximize its domestic reach by striking a new deal with NBCUniversal, which has both a broadcast network and a streaming service, Peacock, that could serve as homes for live games. NBC has a nostalgic relationship with fans, dating back to the Michael Jordan-dominated days of the 1990s’ “The NBA on NBC.” CNBC first reported NBCUniversal’s interest in again airing NBA games earlier this year.
Still, Peacock has just 24 million subscribers, fewer than Disney’s ESPN+ or Warner Bros. Discovery’s Max, and is only available within the U.S.
Broadening reach is important to league officials, who are intrigued by Google’s YouTube TV as a potential streaming partner, according to people familiar with the matter. YouTube TV struck a deal to be the NFL’s exclusive “Sunday Ticket” provider earlier this year. NBA executives have been impressed with the production quality and user experience, said the people.
While YouTube TV, a subscription bundle of linear channels a la traditional pay TV, is only available in the U.S., the league already has an existing global partnership with YouTube that includes providing highlights, game recaps, full-length games and produced segments. YouTube has more than 2.7 billion global monthly active users and can market the sport to a younger audience than Amazon or Apple can do with their subscription services. The average age of an NBA viewer is 49, and 26% of viewers are under 35, according to Nielsen.
Between Amazon and Apple, league officials are currently more comfortable with choosing Amazon as a potential streaming partner, according to people familiar with the matter. Amazon has proven to the NBA it is serious about making a large investment in live sports, including its $1 billion per year contract to carry “Thursday Night Football.” While Apple has deals to carry Major League Soccer and “Friday Night Baseball” for Major League Baseball, the NBA isn’t convinced Apple will prioritize marketing the league’s games in the same way other streaming services might. Apple TV+ has never disclosed how many subscribers it has.
Apple will have a chance to make its pitch directly to the league if and when the NBA begins discussions with other partners after its exclusive window with incumbents expires. It’s possible Apple or Netflix could get a smaller package of games from the NBA as a test run for a future larger partnership. Still, that would run counter to the league’s preference to limit the number of packages it wishes to dole out.
The NBA will have to balance demand against restricting supply to maximize the price for rights. The league probably wants to have just two or three media partners to serve broadcast, cable and streaming eyeballs, according to people familiar with the matter.
Spreading packages between too many media partners will potentially confuse and annoy consumers, who will need to sign up for multiple services and then find where games are streaming on a given day. Currently, an NBA game could appear on Disney’s ESPN or ABC, Warner Bros. Discovery’s TNT, NBA TV, NBA League Pass or a regional sports network. Add new streaming services to the mix, and consumers could easily become overwhelmed with options.
Likewise, if the NBA doesn’t reach a new deal with either ESPN or TNT and goes in another direction, it may accelerate the deterioration of the cable bundle — as live sports is one of the last pillars keeping it alive.
The league hopes to mitigate some of this complexity by marketing its NBA app and NBA.com as digital “front doors” to discover content, according to people familiar with the matter. The league hopes to get fans in the habit of first opening the app or NBA.com before being directly ported to a streaming service that’s broadcasting the game or potentially staying and watching games in-app, depending on partnership arrangements. This is a similar concept to what ESPN has considered, as CNBC reported earlier this year.

The 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing for weeks, reaching a 16-year high of 4.89% Friday after the September jobs report showed that employers were still hiring aggressively. Investors poured more than $1 trillion into new T-bills last quarter, according to Bloomberg.
The playbook, according to Rosner, takes advantage of the presumption that interest rates will be higher for longer than markets had expected earlier this year. If that sentiment holds true, longer-duration Treasuries like the 10-year should offer better yields next year as the yield curve steepens, she said.
“You get to collect a 5% coupon for the next year,” she said. “Then, in a year, you may have opportunities [in longer-duration Treasuries] at greater than 5% in government securities or potentially in [corporate bonds] that are now properly priced.
“You could then get a double-digit yield, but be confident about valuation, unlike now,” she added.
While 10-year Treasuries have crashed in recent weeks, other fixed income instruments including investment-grade and high-yield bonds haven’t fully reflected the change in rate assumptions, according to Rosner. That makes them a bad deal for the moment, but could create opportunities down the road.
The upheaval that’s punished holders of longer-dated Treasuries in recent weeks has professional managers reducing the average duration of their portfolios, according to Ben Emons, head of fixed income at NewEdge Wealth. 
“Treasury bills are in high demand,” he said. “Anyone out there who needs to manage duration in their portfolio, you do that with the 1-year T bill. That’s what BlackRock
is doing, it’s what I’m doing.”"
Michael Wayland,UAW will not expand strikes at Detroit automakers after last-minute GM proposal,"In this article
DETROIT – The United Auto Workers will not expand strikes against the Detroit automakers this week amid progress in the talks, including General Motors
agreeing to include battery cell workers under the company’s national agreement.
This is the first week since targeted strikes by the UAW started on Sept. 15 that the union will not expand the work stoppages at GM, Ford Motor
or Chrysler-parent Stellantis
.
Fain said the union was planning to shut down GM’s Arlington Assembly plant that produces highly profitable full-size SUVs until a last-minute proposal by the company to place the automaker’s battery cell workers under its national agreement.
“Just that threat has provided a transformative win,” Fain, wearing an “EAT THE RICH” T-shirt, said during an online broadcast Friday. “We’ve been told for months that this is impossible ... and now we’ve called their bluff. What this will mean for our membership cannot be understated.”
GM declined to immediately comment on the battery cell workers, citing the ongoing negotiations: “Our goal remains to reach an agreement that rewards our employees and allows GM to be successful into the future.”
GM, with its battery plant in Ohio, is the only Detroit automaker with a joint venture battery plant in operation and unionized in the U.S. The automaker has announced plans for two other U.S. battery cell plants with LG Energy Solution as well as one with Samsung SDI.
GM’s agreement will put pressure on crosstown rivals Ford and Stellantis to do the same, as the UAW tends to pattern agreements off one another for members to receive “equal pay for equal work,” a longstanding motto of the union.
“The plan was to draw down engine and transmission plants and permanently replace them with low-wage battery jobs,” Fain said. “We had a different plan, and our plan is winning at GM. And we expect it to win at Ford and Stellantis as well.”
Electric vehicle battery plants have been a major point of contention in this year’s talks between the union and the three Detroit automakers. Each automaker has formed joint ventures with battery makers to manufacture EV batteries in the United States — a move the union has characterized as a plan to shut it out of the new factories, many of which are under construction now.
Officially, because they’re owned by joint ventures, the battery plants aren’t covered by the automakers’ agreements with the union. The automakers have said that because of that status, the plants shouldn’t be a factor in contract negotiations with the union.
But the UAW has made a “just transition” — meaning, a plan to protect their members as the industry shifts to electric vehicles — a centerpiece of this year’s negotiations, something that has frustrated the automakers. Ford CEO Jim Farley said last week that the UAW is “holding the deal hostage over battery plants.”
Ford declined to comment following Fain’s comments Friday, referring to a statement issued earlier in the week that the company remains “open to the possibility of working with the UAW on future battery plants in the U.S., reminding that these are multibillion-dollar investments and have to operate at sustainably competitive levels.”
Fain said in his Friday presentation that the union had expected to announce an expansion of the strike against GM. “But today, because of our power, GM has agreed to lay the foundation for a just transition,” he said.
UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began, after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts in which all plants simultaneously strike.
“I wish I were here to announce a tentative agreement at one or more of these companies, but I do want to be really clear: We are making significant progress,” Fain said. “In just three weeks, we have moved these companies further than anyone thought was possible.”
Fain said Ford has offered a 23% raise over the life of the expected four and a half year contract, while GM and Stellantis are at around 20%. Stellantis and Ford also have agreed to reinstate a cost-of-living adjustment that the union lost more than a decade ago, among other enhanced proposals by each of the companies.
Stellantis North America Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart, who’s overseeing the negotiations, said the sides “are making progress, but there are gaps that still need to be closed.”
“While we still have some work to do, I remain optimistic that our discussions are providing a pathway to a tentative agreement,” Stewart said.
Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike. Fain previously said the union would increase the work stoppages, based on progress in the contract negotiations.
The strikes began at an assembly plant for each of the Detroit automakers, followed by 38 parts and distribution centers for GM and Stellantis. A week ago, the union expanded strikes to assembly plants for GM in mid-Michigan and Ford in Illinois.
“We’ve been very careful about how we escalate this strategy,” Fain said.
Vehicle production impacted by the strikes include Ford’s Ranger midsize pickup and Bronco, Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs; Stellantis’ Jeep Wrangler SUV and Gladiator small pickup; and GM’s Chevrolet and GMC midsize pickups, Chevrolet Traverse, Cadillac XT4 and Buick Enclave SUVs and Chevrolet Malibu sedan. The Malibu and XT4 production were idled due to parts shortages caused by the strike.
GM this week said the UAW’s strike cost it $200 million in lost production during the third quarter.
UAW negotiators have received counter proposals from each of the Detroit automakers during the past week, starting with Stellantis a week ago before Fain’s Friday strike announcement. Ford followed early in the week with a proposal and then GM submitted a counteroffer Wednesday night."
Robert Hum,Clorox and MGM Resorts aren’t the only companies dealing with cyberattack damage,"In this article
It has been a very eventful couple of weeks for cyberattack-related news.
It all kind of started Wednesday of last week when Johnson Controls
revealed it had been hit by a cyberattack. The company warned it “experienced disruptions in portions of its internal information technology infrastructure and applications.” And while the financial impact of that attack has not yet been determined, it also cautioned, it “is assessing whether the incident will impact its ability to timely release its fourth quarter and full fiscal year results.”
But why is this specific cybersecurity incident of particular interest? Many of Johnson Controls’ customers are federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. That agency is reportedly investigating if any floor plans and security information were exposed as a result of the attack.
Then on Wednesday of this week, Clorox gave a shocking earnings warning. The culprit was a significant cybersecurity breach from August — “which caused wide-scale disruption of Clorox’s operations, including order processing delays and significant product outages.”
What’s more, while it drastically took down fiscal first-quarter numbers, the company is “in the process of assessing the impact of the cybersecurity attack on fiscal year 2024 and beyond.” Clorox is now expecting a hefty year-over-year sales decline as well as a quarterly loss thanks to the incident.
And Thursday night, MGM Resorts
revealed that the cyberattack it experienced in September will cost the company about $100 million. It explained that the incident caused “impacts to occupancy due to the availability of bookings through the company’s website and mobile applications.”
MGM noted that it was mostly contained to the month of September. It does expect that impact beyond the third quarter should be “minimal” and that, overall, it won’t be material to operations and results for the full year. It also reportedly refused to pay ransom.
Unlike its competitor, Caesars
paid a $15 million ransom after suffering its own September data breach. It was fortunate, though, that the incident didn’t impact casino or online operations. The company has not yet disclosed a financial impact.
While those companies all shed light on developments in recent days, keep in mind some of the other marquee names we’ve seen throughout this year alone that have experienced significant cybersecurity issues as well. It’s been a problem all year for a variety of companies.
Campbell Soup
didn’t suffer the same ugly fate as Clorox after experiencing a cyberattack that affected one of its facilities over the summer. The food maker said the incident had a minimal impact on operations and was immaterial to financials.
Another food maker — Dole
— also suffered a cyberattack back in February. It absorbed $10.5 million in costs from the event, which also had a limited impact on operations.
Brunswick
had to temporarily halt some operations after a June cybersecurity incident. That event cost the company about $85 million and caused second-quarter numbers to be “lower than initial expectations.” It apparently took more than a week for operations to resume.
Tempur Sealy
and Estee Lauder
also had to shut down some IT systems after getting hit by separate cyberattacks in July.
Back in March, Sysco
disclosed a data breach that happened in January. While customer and employee data were stolen, there was no operational impact.
Likewise, miner Freeport-McMoRan
suffered a cyberattack in August, but production impact from that was limited."
Michael Sheetz,Amazon launches first internet satellite prototypes,"In this article
Your Amazon
order of internet satellite prototypes have shipped.
More than four years since the tech giant announced its ambitious plan to invest heavily in building a global satellite internet network, Amazon on Friday saw the first pair of satellites for its Project Kuiper system launch into space.
“We’ve done extensive testing here in our lab and have a high degree of confidence in our satellite design, but there’s no substitute for on-orbit testing,” Project Kuiper vice president of technology Rajeev Badyal said in a statement before the launch.
Project Kuiper is Amazon’s plan to build a network of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit, to provide high-speed internet access anywhere in the world. The company plans to invest upwards of $10 billion to build Kuiper, and recently broke ground on a $120 million pre-launch processing facility in Florida.
Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter.
Called “Protoflight,” Friday’s mission saw United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket carry two satellites – Kuipersat-1 and Kuipersat-2. The rocket launched from ULA’s pad SLC-41 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
Amazon twice switched rides for the pair of satellites before finally deciding to go with the immediately available, albeit far overpowered, Atlas V rocket for the Protoflight mission. Amazon originally planned to launch on ABL Space’s RS1 rocket, before delays in RS1′s development moved the satellites to United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket, but delays to Vulcan’s debut moved the satellites to Atlas V.
Information about the size and design of the pair of Amazon’s satellites has been scarce – with the company only sharing photos of the shipping containers that delivered the spacecraft to Florida. Even ULA’s details about the launch are limited, with the info provided comparable to when the rocket company flies classified spy satellites for the U.S. government.
Last year, Amazon announced the biggest corporate rocket deal in the industry’s history to launch Kuiper satellites, signing launch contracts with ULA, Arianespace, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. As part of that deal, Amazon expects to pay about $7.4 billion for Kuiper launches over the next five years. 
It has booked 77 launches – deals that include options for more launches when needed – from that trio of companies to deploy the satellites fast enough to meet regulatory requirements. That massive purchase has come under scrutiny from an Amazon shareholder lawsuit, which alleges the company snubbed SpaceX for valuable satellite launch contracts because of Jeff Bezos’ personal rivalry with Elon Musk.
Amazon is playing catch up to SpaceX, which has grown its Starlink satellite internet service to more than 2 million customers. Crucially, SpaceX says it is no longer absorbing the cost of the Starlink antennas it sells with the service, and the more than 5,000 satellites its launched so far now serve consumer, enterprise, and government customers.
Earlier this week, Amazon reiterated that its first production Kuiper satellites are on track to launch in the first half of next year – with plans to begin beta testing the network with customers by the end of 2024.
Protoflight represents an “end-to-end” test of Kuiper. Amazon will look to verify the prototype satellites can connect to ground antennas and relay that connectivity on to its small customer terminals.
This year Amazon revealed a trio of satellite antennas that it plans to sell to Kuiper customers. The company has yet to say what it expects to charge customers for the hardware or service. Earlier field testing of Amazon’s Kuiper antennas saw download speeds of up to 400 Mbps.
The company’s main Kuiper facilities are near Seattle – in the Washington cities of Redmond and Kirkland. Amazon has other locations in San Diego, Austin, Texas, New York City and Washington, D.C."
Lillian Rizzo,Streaming companies add Spanish-language sports to capture Hispanic viewers,"In this article
Streaming platforms are chasing live sports rights to grow their audiences. Increasingly, those audiences are watching in Spanish.
Media companies that were already geared toward Hispanic audiences, like TelevisaUnivision and fledgling Canela Media, are bulking up on sports rights and content, while traditional English-language streamers, like NBCUniversal’s Peacock that features Telemundo content, Disney’s
ESPN+ and Amazon’s
Prime Video are adding simulcast content in Spanish.
It’s an effort to diversify viewership and advertising opportunities — and to capitalize on a growing Hispanic streaming audience.
“Sports is the pinnacle of premium content that can really help a streaming service,” said Shirin Malkani, co-chair of the sports industry group at law firm Perkins Coie. “If you offer it in Spanish as well as English you may not be doubling your audience but you’re certainly growing it by a large percentage. You are reaching an audience I would argue maybe we haven’t done a great job getting sports content to.”
Lea este artículo en español aquí.
Hispanic audiences spend nearly nine hours per day consuming media, the majority of which is TV viewership, according to a recent study from Nielsen based on viewership habits from July. The study noted the Hispanic audience has been at “the forefront of cord-cutting,” making it a growing majority of streaming viewership, too.
According to the findings, Hispanic viewers spend more than 50% of their time consuming TV through streaming, eclipsing the general population, at nearly 40%.
“When I think about the Latino space in particular ... I think it’s an amazing opportunity,” said Eli Velazquez, executive vice president of Telemundo Deportes. “Latinos are pretty much the youngest demographic of all groups by about 13 years, and they’re early adopters of technology. They like to consume content on streaming platforms.”
Traditional media companies across the board have been doling out cash for sports as live games still command the highest traditional TV viewership. These companies are also fighting to make their streaming outlets profitable, with sports representing a key subscriber driver.
Chief among the value drivers is the rising popularity of soccer in the U.S.
Hispanic audiences have long been loyal fans of the sport, which is now gaining steam in American households, helped of late and in part by the arrival of soccer legend Lionel Messi to Major League Soccer’s Inter Miami.
Disney’s ESPN+ recently bought the rights to Spanish league LaLiga in both languages for an eight-year period.
Leaning into Spanish-language broadcasts allows media companies to not only build up their streaming subscriber bases across various demographics but also opens up new advertising opportunities as ad-based subscription tiers help streaming platforms inch toward profitability.
“You can really have a personalized, customized ad load for the Spanish audience, and potentially a different set of advertisers,” Malkani said.
Peacock, for one streamer, has already reaped the benefits of its sports offerings.
Parent company Comcast
touted the growing portfolio — Spanish-language sports, included — during a recent earnings call, noting that the 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup in Qatar helped the company to add 5 million subscribers during the fourth quarter.
Streaming made up 30% of total viewership for the 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup, compared to 9% in 2018, according to Telemundo Deportes.
Telemundo and Peacock aired the matches in Spanish. Fox
holds the English-language rights.
Peacock, which has relied heavily on its cheaper, ad-supported offering, had 24 million subscribers as of June 30. Other streamers like Netflix and Disney+ have followed suit with ad-supported subscription options.
“I think accessibility and convenience is why we’re leaning more into the streaming product,” Velazquez said, noting he often works with the NBC Sports and Peacock teams to figure out the best streaming strategy for Telemundo’s sports.
Peacock also airs Spanish-language broadcasts of some Premier League soccer games as well as the NFL’s “Sunday Night Football.”
NFL media rights across languages are sold to U.S. media companies, who are then able to sub-license them to other companies if they don’t have a Spanish-language outlet.
Amazon
’s Prime Video, the exclusive home of “Thursday Night Football,” has a Spanish-language simulcast each week, too.
“It’s really cool when you have that hardcore fan base that’s learning [the sport] and follows the Thursday night broadcast,” said Rolando Cantu, a former NFL player and analyst on “TNF en Espanol.” “Now we’re part of the Latino culture, and Spanish-speaking people want to engage and consume our broadcast.”
Meanwhile, TelevisaUnivision will air the Super Bowl in Spanish in 2024, although it’s unclear if it will be available on both traditional TV and streaming via the company’s Vix platform, which launched in 2022.
Paramount
’s broadcast network CBS will air the English-language version of the game on TV and streaming.
TelevisaUnivision has been snapping up more sports rights in a bid to expand its audience. Streaming offers an additional platform to air more games.
High-profile soccer matches featuring the English Premier League, LaLiga and Serie A often take place at the same time making it difficult to land space on traditional broadcast channels.
“Five years ago it was very difficult for us to put anything on screen, because if you’re a soccer fan you know that most soccer happens on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and sometimes Monday. So obviously there’s overlap, right?” said Olek Loewenstein, global president of sports at TelevisaUnivision, adding that it was difficult to cater to various audiences and soccer fan bases.
“That’s where streaming comes into play. We can suddenly cater to Argentinians with the Argentinian league and Brazilians with the Brazilian league,” Loewenstein said.
TelevisaUnivision recently renewed its deal for the rights to UEFA’s Champions League, paying about $225 million over three years, according to a person familiar with the matter. TelevisaUnivision will also air major soccer events including the Copa America tournament and UEFA’s Euro games next summer. That’s happening on top of the rights to broadcast other soccer leagues, such as Liga MX.
“Over the past 10 years, premium rates [for sports rights] have gone up exponentially and non-premium rights have started to disappear,” Loewenstein said. “People are betting on the premium rights out there, because those are the ones that drive either audience or subscriptions.”
Loewenstein said the amount being invested in sports now is the most he’s seen joining TelevisaUnivision in 2011. Having more to offer the viewer, he said, has played a key role in Vix’s growth.
“I need to be able to convince you to come back the next month or the next week. And I think that’s where sports plays a great role,” Loewenstein said. “For us, sports has been a very key component of the strategy of growth for the base.”

Hugh Son,‘Rate shock’: Why borrowing costs for nearly everything are surging,"Violent moves in the bond market this week have hammered investors and renewed fears of a recession, as well as concerns about housing, banks and even the fiscal sustainability of the U.S. government.
At the center of the storm is the 10-year Treasury yield
, one of the most influential numbers in finance. The yield, which represents borrowing costs for issuers of bonds, has climbed steadily in recent weeks and reached 4.88% on Tuesday, a level last seen just before the 2008 financial crisis.
The relentless rise in borrowing costs has blown past forecasters’ predictions and has Wall Street casting about for explanations. While the Federal Reserve has been raising its benchmark rate for 18 months, that hasn’t impacted longer-dated Treasurys like the 10-year until recently as investors believed rate cuts were likely coming in the near term.
That began to change in July with signs of economic strength defying expectations for a slowdown. It gained speed in recent weeks as Fed officials remained steadfast that interest rates will remain elevated. Some on Wall Street believe that part of the move is technical in nature, sparked by selling from a country or large institutions. Others are fixated on the spiraling U.S. deficit and political dysfunction. Still others are convinced that the Fed has intentionally caused the surge in yields to slow down a too-hot U.S. economy.
“The bond market is telling us that this higher cost of funding is going to be with us for a while,” Bob Michele, global head of fixed income for JPMorgan Chase’s asset management division, said Tuesday in a Zoom interview. “It’s going to stay there because that’s where the Fed wants it. The Fed is slowing you, the consumer, down.”
Investors are fixated on the 10-year Treasury yield because of its primacy in global finance.
While shorter-duration Treasurys are more directly moved by Fed policy, the 10-year is influenced by the market and reflects expectations for growth and inflation. It’s the rate that matters most to consumers, corporations and governments, influencing trillions of dollars in home and auto loans, corporate and municipal bonds, commercial paper, and currencies.
“When the 10-year moves, it affects everything; it’s the most watched benchmark for rates,” said Ben Emons, head of fixed income at NewEdge Wealth. “It impacts anything that’s financing for corporates or people.”
The yield’s recent moves have the stock market on a razor’s edge as some of the expected correlations between asset classes have broken down.
Stocks have sold off since yields began rising in July, giving up much of the year’s gains, but the typical safe haven of U.S. Treasurys has fared even worse. Longer-dated bonds have lost 46% since a March 2020 peak, according to Bloomberg, a precipitous decline for what’s supposed to be one of the safest investments available.
“You have equities falling like it’s a recession, rates climbing like growth has no bounds, gold selling off like inflation is dead,” said Benjamin Dunn, a former hedge fund chief risk officer who now runs consultancy Alpha Theory Advisors. “None of it makes sense.”′
But beyond investors, the impact on most Americans is yet to come, especially if rates continue their climb.
That’s because the rise in long-term yields is helping the Fed in its fight against inflation. By tightening financial conditions and lowering asset prices, demand should ease as more Americans cut back on spending or lose their jobs. Credit card borrowing has increased as consumers spend down their excess savings, and delinquencies are at their highest since the Covid pandemic began.
“People have to borrow at a much higher rate than they would have a month ago, two months ago, six months ago,” said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector investing at Goldman Sachs
asset and wealth management.
“Unfortunately, I do think there has to be some pain for the average American now,” she said.
Beyond the consumer, that could be felt as employers pull back from what has been a strong economy. Companies that can only issue debt in the high-yield market, which includes many retail employers, will confront sharply higher borrowing costs. Higher rates squeeze the housing industry and push commercial real estate closer to default.
“For anyone with debt coming due, this is a rate shock,” said Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group. “Any real estate person who has a loan coming due, any business whose floating rate loan is due, this is tough.”
The spike in yields also adds pressure to regional banks holding bonds that have fallen in value, one of the key factors in the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. While analysts don’t expect more banks to collapse, the industry has been seeking to offload assets and has already pulled back on lending.
“We are now 100 basis points higher in yield” than in March, Rosner said. “So if banks haven’t fixed their issues since then, the problem is only worse, because rates are only higher.”
The rise in the 10-year paused at midweek and picked up Friday, after a much stronger than expected jobs report. The yield climbed 11 basis points to 4.83%.
But after piercing through previous resistance levels, many expect that yields can climb higher, since the factors believed to be driving yields are still in place.
That has raised fears that the U.S. could face a debt crisis where higher rates and spiraling deficits become entrenched, a concern boosted by the possibility of a government shutdown next month.
“There are real concerns of ‘Are we operating at a debt-to-GDP level that is untenable?’” Rosner said.
Since the Fed began raising rates last year, there have been two episodes of financial turmoil: the September 2022 collapse in the U.K.’s government bonds and the March U.S. regional banking crisis.
Another move higher in the 10-year yield from here would heighten the chances something else breaks and makes recession much more likely, JPMorgan’s Michele said.   
“If we get over 5% in the long end, this is legitimately another rate shock,” Michele said. “At that point, you have to keep your eyes open for whatever looks frail.”"
Lillian Rizzo,Arizona Coyotes local games move to broadcast – the latest big shift in sports TV,"In this article
The Arizona Coyotes are skating to a new TV home for local games – showcasing the pressure on cable TV bundles due to cord cutting while broadcast stations look to nab more sports media rights.
The NHL team reached a multi-year deal with broadcast station owner E.W. Scripps Co.
on Thursday that will see its local games air on over-the-air networks. The NHL season begins Tuesday.
The transition to broadcast from cable TV came as Diamond Sports Group, the largest owner of regional sports networks, opted to reject its contract with the Coyotes, according to court papers. Diamond is under bankruptcy protection.
A streaming option will be available to fans soon, Scripps and the Coyotes said in a release.
The Coyotes’ local games aired on Bally Sports Arizona. However, earlier this year the other professional teams that aired on the network – MLB’s Arizona Diamondbacks, the NBA’s Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury – exited for new TV homes for local games after Diamond rejected their contracts.
Terms of the deal between the Coyotes and Scripps were not disclosed Thursday.
By rejecting the Coyotes’ contract, Diamond leaves Bally Sports Arizona defunct. The move came after the company said it determined the network “was not profitable,” which is why it rejected the contracts with the other teams, too.
The Suns and Mercury reached a similar deal earlier this year with broadcast station owner Gray Television
, and are launching a direct-to-consumer streaming option. MLB began running the distribution of the Diamondbacks, as well as the San Diego Padres, another contract rejected by Diamond, earlier this year.
Broadcast station owners like Scripps and Gray have been vying for the rights to local games, especially as there may be more that become available due to the Diamond bankruptcy filing, CNBC previously reported. Scripps has already reached deals to carry the NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights – who won the Stanley Cup earlier this year – and a set of WNBA games on its networks.
Meanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery
is on the way to exiting the regional sports network business – which it inherited in the 2022 merger between Warner Media and Discovery – by the end of the year, which has put another handful of teams up for grabs. Recently, MLB’s Houston Astros and NBA’s Houston Rockets said they acquired AT&T SportsNet Southwest and will relaunch it as Space City Home Network.
Even though most consumers watch broadcast networks as part of their cable bundles, the channels are free over-the-air, therefore increasing the teams’ reach and potential viewership.
Still, the economics behind the regional sports network business model has long propped up the leagues and teams with high fees. It remains unclear whether deals with broadcast stations can replicate that model.
The landscape for local games has dramatically shifted as consumers flee the traditional cable TV bundle and opt for streaming services. Diamond filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, and stopped paying rights fees for some of the teams on its channels.
The company has said it’s looking to renegotiate other rights payments deals while under bankruptcy protection. Earlier this week Diamond asked the bankruptcy court to extend the amount of time it has to file a reorganization plan.
Diamond said its rights fees to the Coyotes total “tens of millions of dollars annually and increase yearly,” and the company would have owed “a substantial payment” to the team as of Oct. 1, with additional payments in subsequent months, had it not rejected the contract."
Laya Neelakandan,Hyundai and Kia to adopt Tesla’s EV charging tech next year,"In this article
Hyundai Motor
and Kia announced Thursday they will soon adopt Tesla’s
electric vehicle charging system, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the United States.
Hyundai and Kia join others like Ford
and General Motors
to integrate the Tesla charging ports, called North American Charging Standard, into their electric vehicles, allowing drivers to use any Tesla charging stations. The charging tech has gained steam in recent months toward becoming a unified charging standard among electric vehicle makers.
The South Korean automakers said all new electric vehicles built in 2024 and beyond will incorporate Tesla’s NACS technology to gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
“Our collaboration with Tesla marks another milestone in our commitment to delivering exceptional EV experiences to our customers,” said José Muñoz, president and global COO of Hyundai. “This new alliance will provide Hyundai EV owners confidence in their ability to conveniently charge their vehicles and complements our joint venture company to create a new, high-powered charging network with at least 30,000 stations across North America.”
Additionally, owners of current Hyundai and Kia electric vehicle models will be able to access Tesla Superchargers using adapters beginning in the first quarter of 2025.
GM CEO Mary Barra has said the automaker expects to see up to $400 million in savings by adoption the NACS technology."
Melissa Repko,"Levi Strauss cuts full-year sales forecast again, as inflation takes a toll","In this article
Levi Strauss
on Thursday cut its full-year sales forecast, as it missed Wall Street’s quarterly revenue expectations and was dragged down by weaker shopping trends at department stores and big-box retailers across the U.S.
Shares fell slightly in extended trading.
The company’s more cautious outlook comes just three months after it already slashed its full-year profit outlook. It said it now expects net revenues to be flat to up 1% year-over-year compared with a prior range of between 1.5% to 2.5% growth. It said it anticipates adjusted earnings per share to be on the low-end of the previously shared range of $1.10 to $1.20.
In an interview with CNBC, CEO Chip Bergh said shoppers – pinched by inflation, rising mortgage rates and gas prices – have bought fewer items from retailers that carry Levi’s apparel.
“All the things that are impacting that middle-income consumer are impacting our wholesale business,” he said.
Here’s how the denim retailer did in its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
Net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 27 was $10 million, or 2 cents per share, compared with $173 million, or 43 cents per share a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were 28 cents.
Sales were roughly in line from the $1.52 billion in revenue that the company reported in the year-ago period.
Chief Financial and Growth Officer Harmit Singh said on the earnings call that the company took a conservative approach with its outlook, despite seeing continued momentum in its direct-to-consumer business and improving trends in its wholesale business in the first part of the fiscal fourth quarter.
Like other retailers, Levi — which also includes Dockers and Beyond Yoga — has coped with a tougher sales backdrop in the U.S. Levi sells its items directly on its website and in its own stores across the globe, but also sells many items through chains retailers like Macy’s, Kohl’s
and Target
. Those retailers, which buy wholesale items from Levi to carry on their stores and websites, have seen weaker discretionary sales.
Bergh said its value-based denim lines, Signature by Levi Strauss and Denizen, have especially been softer. In the third quarter, he said sales of those brands, which are carried by Walmart and Target, were down double digits, he said.
“Clearly, that’s an indication that that value consumer is under pressure,” he said.
For Levi, direct sales and international sales have been the stronger parts of its business. Like Nike
, Levi has tried to control its own destiny by driving more of its overall sales through its own stores and website.
In the fiscal third quarter, net revenues from Levi’s direct-to-consumer business increased 14% compared with the year-ago period. E-commerce revenuer shot up by 19% year over year, as the company posted double-digit growth across all of its brands.
Direct-to-consumer drove 40% of total net revenues in the fiscal third quarter. It has pledged to get that up to 55% by fiscal 2027.
Net revenue from wholesale dropped 8% year-over-year, as sales gains in Asia and Latin America weren’t enough to offset declines in North America and Europe.
Along with driving more direct sales, Levi is looking to expand in international markets. On an earnings call with investors, Levi CEO-in-waiting Michelle Gass, tapped to succeed Bergh, said the company is poised for growth because its brand resonates across the world, especially with younger consumers. 
The brand is already sold in 110 countries, but she said Levi can gain market share in countries such as Mexico and India. In Mexico, for example, sales have shot up nearly 40% compared with pre-pandemic levels, she said.
Levi can capitalize on its fashion reputation by selling more of other types of clothing like chinos, tops and outerwear, along with jeans, she said.
Bergh told CNBC unseasonably warm weather in the U.S. and Europe likely played a role in worse wholesale trends, too.
Most of the Levi apparel that Walmart
, J.C.Penney, Macy’s
and others carry are jeans, he said.
“It’s hard to sell blue jeans when it’s 110 degrees outside,” he said on a call with CNBC.
At its own stores, he said, Levi can has a wider range of clothing, such as tank tops, skirts and shorts it can swap out based on customer trends — and the temperature. Plus, he said, it draws shoppers who have higher incomes and are willing to pay more for fashion-forward premium denim.
“We know that $100,000 and up consumer is a little bit less impacted by what’s happening from a macro [economic] standpoint,” he said. “We’re all being affected, to be clear, but they’ve got a little bit more income to spend and the people that are coming into our stores they want to buy Levi’s.”
Levi made an unusual move in recent months: Cutting prices of about half a dozen more price-sensitive items sold by other retailers to try to jumpstart sales. Bergh said in July that Levi would lower the price of select pairs of jeans from $79.50 to $69.50. That price is still higher than its pre-pandemic price of $59.50, Bergh said.
Retailers had control over when to cut those prices, but some took effect in early August — the final month of the third quarter, Bergh said.
“As retailers have reflected price reductions to the consumer on those particular fits, the trends have improved,” he said.
He said the company is “cautiously optimistic” that as new styles debut and the holiday season approaches, customers may be more willing to open their wallets.
One factor that could help Levi this holiday season? Cleaner inventories across the retail industry, Bergh said. In the year-ago period, many retailers’ biggest holiday wish was to clear through a glut of unsold merchandise. That led to lots of deep discounts and less profitable sales.
Bergh said he expects a “slightly less promotional environment than a year ago.”
“We’re not gonna lead aggressive promotions, but we will be competitive,” he said.
Shares of Levi have fallen about 14% so far this year, underperforming the 11% gains of the S&P 500. The company’s stock closed on Thursday at $13.21, down nearly 2%."
Michael Sheetz,Washington reusable rocket startup Stoke Space raises $100 million,"Washington-based startup Stoke Space raised $100 million in new funds, the company announced Thursday, as it aims to develop a fully reusable rocket called “Nova.”
Stoke’s latest investment round was led by Industrious Ventures – with the firm’s Steve Angel, chairman of chemicals giant Linde
, joining the Stoke board of directors. The space company’s fundraise was also joined by investors including the University of Michigan, Sparta Group, Long Journey, Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, YCombinator, Point72 Ventures, NFX, MaC Ventures, Toyota Ventures and In-Q-Tel.
Founded in 2019, Stoke had previously raised $75 million to date. A company spokesperson declined to comment on Stoke’s post-money valuation.
“The priority is to be able to keep the pedal to the metal and continue to develop in order to get to market as soon as possible and really fortify what is still a very fragile commercial space economy,” Stoke co-founder and CEO Andy Lapsa told CNBC.
Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter.
Stoke’s fresh backing comes weeks after the company completed a low altitude launch of its vehicle “Hopper2,” in which the rocket-powered prototype flew to about 30 feet before landing successfully after 15 seconds.
While a number of U.S. companies are aiming to develop reusable rockets to compete with the success of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Stoke is taking a different approach from its rivals. Lapsa explained that the company has been developing and testing the second stage of the rocket before the first stage, because “it’s not something that can be tacked on and added later.”
“First of all, the technology solution wasn’t out there yet, [and, second,] we wanted to know what that looked like in order to build the right first stage to go under it,” Lapsa said.
Stoke is developing Nova to be a “medium” class rocket that can deliver 5,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. That puts Nova in the middle of the launch market, between Rocket Lab’s “light” Electron and SpaceX’s “heavy” Falcon 9 in terms of capability.
Stoke has 95 employees currently, with a manufacturing and engineering facility in Kent, Washington, and a test facility in Moses Lake, Washington.
Earlier this year Space Force assigned Stoke with a launchpad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, which Lapsa said the company is starting to develop. Next up will be evolving its “Hopper2” vehicle “into an orbit-ready second stage,” Lapsa said, and building the large first stage of the rocket, all of which should be “coming together pretty soon.”
“We’re trying to position ourselves to provide the best value to the satellite industry, in order to really shorten the time from factory to revenue,” Lapsa said."
Laya Neelakandan,Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert film surpasses $100 million in ticket sales,"In this article
Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert film is already a $100 million blockbuster — and it hasn’t even hit theaters yet.
AMC
announced Thursday that global advance ticket sales for the pop singer’s movie surpassed the jaw-dropping threshold this week.
“Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is set to hit the big screen on Oct. 13 in more than 100 countries across the world, distributed by AMC.
AMC said audience demand for the movie has been exceedingly high since the film was announced, shattering the theater chain’s U.S. record for the highest ticket sales revenue during a single day.
Box office analysts projected the film could rake in $100 million on its opening weekend, with some expecting the movie to remain in theaters longer than its scheduled run due to the high interest.
The film will chronicle Swift’s experience during her record-breaking Eras Tour."
Michael Wayland,"GM’s stock hits three-year low amid UAW strike, potential air bag recall","In this article
DETROIT – General Motors’
stock price fell below $30 a share during intraday trading Thursday for the first time in more than three years amid ongoing strikes by the United Auto Workers union and a report of a potentially costly airbag recall for the automaker.
Since the UAW union’s targeted strikes began Sept. 15, shares of the Detroit automaker have fallen by about 10%. The stock closed Thursday at $30.31 a share, down by 2.4%.
The most recent share decline occurred midday Thursday following The Wall Street Journal reporting GM has at least 20 million vehicles built with a potentially dangerous air-bag part that the government says should be recalled before more people are hurt or killed.
The potential recall of roughly 52 million air-bag inflators from Tennessee-based auto supplier ARC Automotive had been reported about previously, but the number of affected GM vehicles had not.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration held a public meeting Thursday on its determination that the air-bag parts are defective and should be recalled, according to the report. Automakers, including GM, have until later this year to file responses on the matter.
GM has recalled about 1 million vehicles due to the problem. The company reiterated Thursday that it “believes the evidence and data presented by NHTSA at this time does not provide a basis for any recall” beyond the ones the company has already done.
“Neither the affected automakers nor NHTSA, despite eight years of study and investigation, have identified a systemic design or manufacturing defect in ARC frontal airbag inflators,” the company said in an emailed statement. “If GM concludes at any time that any unrecalled ARC inflators are unsafe, the company will take appropriate action in cooperation with NHTSA.”
GM said it “will continue to work collaboratively with NHTSA, other manufacturers, and ARC to monitor and investigate the long-term performance and safety of ARC airbag inflators.”
While many Wall Street analysts have said a strike by the UAW was already priced into GM shares, the automaker’s stock has only experienced five positive trading days out of 14 sessions.
GM confirmed Thursday it had made a counteroffer to the union, marking its sixth since the start of negotiations. It comes a day after the automaker said the strike cost it $200 million in lost production during the third quarter.
“We believe we have a compelling offer that would reward our team members and allow GM to succeed and thrive into the future. We continue to stand ready and willing to negotiate in good faith 24/7 to reach an agreement,” the company said Thursday in an emailed statement.
The last time shares of GM dropped below $30 a share during intraday trading was on Oct. 2, 2020, according to FactSet."
Lillian Rizzo,Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy’s TGL golf league will air on ESPN,"Disney’
s ESPN has nabbed the broadcast rights to air matches from TGL, the startup golf league led by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.
TGL, which is in partnership with the PGA Tour, will have its debut Jan. 9 as part of a multiyear deal. A preview show will air on Disney’s broadcast network ABC on Dec. 30.
The early games of the TGL season will air near other sports events and appear on Disney’s ESPN+, a move that allows the streamer to bulk up on more live sports rights.
The inaugural match will air the night after the College Football Playoff’s title game, and the second will come the following evening after an NFL wild-card playoff game. Both TGL matches will air on traditional TV’s ESPN and streamer ESPN+. The rest of the matches will air on ESPN’s TV networks, as well as ESPN+.
The launch of the new league comes as professional golf finds itself at a major crossroads following a proposed deal between the Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund-backed rival LIV Golf in June. The agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV has yet to be finalized. The Tour has attracted potential outside investors, including Endeavor Group Holdings and Fenway Sports Group, CNBC recently reported. Some of the outside investors are considering making a rival pitch to PIF’s proposal.
TGL, a new primetime, high-tech golf league created by Woods, McIlroy and former NBC Sports executive Mike McCarley, has attracted stars from the PGA Tour. In addition to Woods and McIlroy, other top players including Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Matt Fitzpatrick, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Xander Schauffele, Max Homa, Rickie Fowler and Billy Horschel have committed to play. More players are expected to be announced.
The PGA Tour is an investor in the new league, and the new league has said the event timing will be complementary to the players’ schedules in the Tour.
Steve Cohen, billionaire and owner of Major League Baseball’s New York Mets, is also an investor after buying the founding rights to the New York team in TGL. His team will be managed by his family office, Cohen Private Ventures.
The league will feature the Tour players split into six teams, who will play two-hour, head-to-head match-play matches in a specially built arena in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The matches will incorporate live action as well as the latest golf technology."
John Rosevear,Rivian shares fell over 20% after the EV maker said it plans to raise $1.5 billion,"In this article
Shares of Rivian Automotive fell sharply on Thursday, after the company surprised investors with a plan to offer $1.5 billion in convertible notes.
It also provided a preliminary estimate of its third-quarter revenue that was in line with Wall Street estimates.
Shares closed down over 22% on Thursday.
In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Rivian said it expects its third-quarter revenue to come in between $1.29 billion and $1.33 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street estimates of $1.3 billion, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.
Rivian also estimated that it had cash and equivalents of $9.1 billion as of Sep. 30, down from $10.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
Rivian took steps earlier this year to slow spending and bolster its balance sheet, including a 6% staff reduction in February and a $1.3 billion sale of convertible notes in March. The company also delayed the launch of its upcoming smaller R2 vehicle platform to 2026, from 2025. But news of the latest offering came as a surprise to investors.
Rivian plans to offer $1.5 billion worth of senior, unsecured “green” convertible notes due in 2030. Buyers will have the option to purchase up to an additional $225 million worth of notes, the company said.
Rivian on Monday reported third-quarter deliveries that were better than Wall Street had expected. The EV maker will report its third-quarter earnings after the U.S. markets close Nov. 7."
Drew Richardson,Clorox shares slide after company says cyberattack hit sales hard,"In this article
Shares of Clorox
fell more than 5% Thursday, a day after the company said an August cyberattack significantly weighed on sales and profits during the prior quarter.
The stock hit a 52-week low and is down more than 11% so far this year.
While the Pine-Sol and bleach maker said it had contained the hack, which severely hampered its production, it said it continues to deal with the fallout even as its operations gradually get back to normal.
Raymond James also downgraded the stock to market perform Thursday morning, citing the larger-than-expected material effect the attack had on the company.
Raymond James said it struggles “to see a recovery in the stock near-term, as it would be based on a view of a quick sales and profit bounce back from the attack during a period in which consumers appear to be making more price conscious choices and as commodity costs start to move upward again.”
Clorox said after the bell Wednesday that it expects to report a 23% to 28% decline in sales during the quarter that ended Sept. 30.
Clorox also said it estimates its gross margin for the quarter will be down from the year-ago period. It expects to post a per share loss of 35 cents to 75 cents. On an adjusted basis, it projects a loss of up to 40 cents a share."
Stefan Sykes,Constellation Brands beats on earnings as Modelo-fueled beer momentum continues,"In this article
Constellation Brands
on Thursday reported earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations for its fiscal second quarter of 2024.
The Mexican beer powerhouse, owner of the Modelo Especial and Corona Extra brands, reported double-digit sales growth in its beer business as the division continues to dominate the overall beer and high-end categories. Meanwhile, sales of wine and spirits lagged.
The company raised its fiscal 2024 earnings per share outlook to a range of $9.60 to $9.80, up from a prior range of $9.35 to $9.65.
Here’s what Constellation reported for the three months ending Aug. 31, compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
Constellation’s beer portfolio posted 12% sales growth, boosted by 8.7% growth in shipments. The Modelo brand family was a particular bright spot: Modelo Especial grew nearly 9%, while Modelo Chelada brands posted growth of more than 40%.
Modelo Especial remains the best-selling brand in the U.S. beer category, the company said.
The company’s wine and spirits brands, however, underperformed year over year.
The category posted a 14% decrease in sales and a nearly 8% decrease in depletions, an industry term for the number of cases sold to retailers by a distributor.
On a conference call with analysts Thursday, CEO Bill Newlands said the company’s wine and spirits business continued to face lower demand, primarily among its mainstream brands, as consumers continue to favor premium-priced beverages.
The division wasn’t without its standout brands, though: Constellation’s Meiomi and Kim Crawford wine brands saw 7% and 6% depletion growth, respectively, while its craft spirit, Mi Campo Tequila, reported more than 60% depletion growth.
Newlands added that the wine and spirits business should begin to benefit from price increases and a boost from direct-to-consumer channels.
“The benefits of our wine and spirits strategy continue to take hold. We expected net sales growth and operating income growth of that business to ramp up through the remainder of fiscal ’24,” said Newlands. “And as we look to the coming years, we anticipate our wine and spirits business to further gain momentum and achieve stronger results.”
Back in June, the company delivered an earnings beat and reiterated its forecast. In its previous quarter, beer sales rose 11% year over year driven by stable consumer demand and higher pricing."
Annika Kim Constantino,"Weight loss drugs may be linked to stomach paralysis, study says","In this article
Blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic may be associated with an increased risk of three rare, but severe, stomach conditions in non-diabetic patients, according to a new epidemiological study released Thursday. 
The study, published in the research journal JAMA, comes as Novo Nordisk
’s Wegovy, Ozempic and similar treatments skyrocket in popularity in the U.S. for their ability to cause dramatic weight loss over time. But those drugs, known as GLP-1s, are also facing increased scrutiny after some patients reported experiencing stomach paralysis and suicidal ideation while taking them. 
GLP-1s work by slowing digestion to suppress a person’s appetite but can cause problems if that process slows down too much.
Researchers at the University of British Columbia said the conditions in the study include one disorder not named in the warning labels for those drugs: stomach paralysis, which slows or completely stops the movement of food from the stomach to the intestine and can cause symptoms like persistent vomiting. 
The study also notes an increased risk of bowel obstruction, a disorder where food is blocked from passing through the small or large intestine, and pancreatitis, which refers to pancreas inflammation. The labels for the drugs already include warnings about pancreatitis and certain types of bowel obstruction.
The researchers specifically examined semaglutide – the active ingredient used in Wegovy and Ozempic – and another GLP-1 called liraglutide against another weight loss treatment called bupropion-naltrexone, which works differently to help patients lose weight. Wegovy is specifically approved for weight loss in the U.S., while Ozempic is only approved for diabetes.
Their research is the first large, population-level study to examine the risk of serious stomach conditions in non-diabetic patients specifically using GLP-1s for weight loss. 
Previous studies have highlighted the risk of those conditions in diabetic patients taking GLP-1s, according to the researchers. People with diabetes are also at increased risk of experiencing stomach paralysis and pancreatitis overall, even without the treatments. 
“That’s why we kind of wanted to take diabetes out of the equation,” said Mohit Sodhi, one of the authors of the study. “In addition to the fact that millions of people around the world are using these drugs to help them lose weight.” 
A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk noted that some of the gastrointestinal side effects in the study are already included on the labels for its GLP-1s, adding that the company “stands behind the safety and efficacy of all of our GLP-1 medicines when used consistent with the product labeling and approved indications.”
“We recommend patients take these medications for their approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional,” the spokesperson said. “Treatment decisions should be made together with a healthcare provider who can evaluate the appropriateness of using a GLP-1 based on assessment of a patient’s individual medical profile.”
The study findings are based on an analysis of health insurance claim records for roughly 16 million U.S. patients. 
Researchers specifically looked at people with a recent history of obesity who were prescribed semaglutide or liraglutide between 2006 and 2020. They excluded those with diabetes or patients who had been prescribed another diabetes drug. 
Most patients in the study were prescribed liraglutide, but researchers said the increased risks they observed could apply to the entire GLP-1 drug class. 
“Our data end date was the end of 2020, while the recent boom in semaglutide happened in the last year,” Sodhi said. “Nonetheless, we believe it is a class effect.” 
The researchers measured the rate at which patients developed four different serious stomach conditions while taking semaglutide, liraglutide and bupropion-naltrexone, which are stomach paralysis, pancreatitis, bowel obstruction and biliary disease, a group of conditions affecting the gall bladder.
Compared with bupropion-naltrexone, GLP-1s were associated with a 9 times higher risk of pancreatitis, a 4 times higher risk of bowel obstruction and a more than 3 times higher risk of stomach paralysis, according to the study. The findings suggest the risks of those conditions are higher in patients specifically taking GLP-1s rather than other weight loss medications that work differently.
Around 7 out of every 1,000 patients experienced stomach paralysis while taking liraglutide, and nearly 10 out of every 1,000 patients experienced that condition while taking semaglutide. 
And Sodhi noted, “the number just continues to climb when you blow it up to the population level.” 
“When you have more than a million people taking the medication worldwide, that’s 10,000 people who could potentially experience gastroparesis according to the incidence rate for semaglutide,” he told CNBC. “It’s rare, but that’s still a lot of people.”
Almost 5 out of every 1,000 patients experienced pancreatitis while taking semaglutide, while roughly 8 out of every 1,000 patients experienced that condition while taking liraglutide. 
Meanwhile, around 8 out of every 1,000 patients experienced bowel obstruction while taking either of those GLP-1s. 
The researchers also found a high rate of biliary disease in patients taking either liraglutide or semaglutide, but they said the difference was “not found to be statistically significant.”
The researchers hope the study will inform health-care providers prescribing GLP-1s about the potential drawbacks of taking the drugs. 
“We’re all big proponents for informed patient consent,” Sodhi said. “If someone has decided they would like to take a GLP-1 for weight loss, we encourage them to have a conversation with their provider about how it may help them achieve their goals. But they should also be made aware of the potential drawbacks of taking this medication.” "
John Rosevear,Lucid’s shares fall after company launches a cheaper version of the Air EV,"In this article
Shares of Lucid Group fell on Thursday after the company launched a cheaper version of its Air electric luxury sedan in a bid to stoke demand.
The stock closed down about 7% on Thursday following the news.
Lucid said it will now offer a single-motor, rear-wheel-drive version of its Air Pure sedan starting at $77,400 with 410 miles of range. That’s $5,000 lower than its previous lowest-cost model, the dual-motor all-wheel-drive version of the Air Pure, which is still available.
The new single-motor Air Pure is available for order immediately, Lucid said.
Lucid’s shares are down over 24% since the beginning of 2023 through Thursday’s close as concerns linger about ongoing demand for the Air. While the Air has received strong reviews and can claim the longest range of any electric vehicle currently available in the U.S., it’s expensive, a growing concern as consumer borrowing costs have risen and as rivals including EV giant Tesla have cut prices sharply over the past several months.
The new rear-wheel-drive version of the Air Pure is the first Lucid offering to start below $80,000. At the high end, the 1,234 horsepower Sapphire version of the Air costs $249,000.
Lucid hasn’t yet released its third-quarter production and deliveries totals. It’s expected to report its third-quarter financial results in early November."
Robert Frank,Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos retires after boosting sales sixfold,"Torsten Muller-Otvos, the Rolls-Royce CEO who turned an aging brand into a coveted badge of success for pop stars, athletes and young entrepreneurs, is retiring after 14 years.
Rolls-Royce announced Thursday that Muller-Otvos, 63, the longest-serving CEO of Rolls-Royce in nearly a century, will retire on Dec. 1. He will be succeeded by Chris Brownridge, currently chief executive officer of BMW UK.
Muller-Otvos brought new shine to the Rolls-Royce brand and became a leader in the luxury world by attracting a new generation of wealthy buyers. With sleek models like the fastback Wraith, and edgy design schemes like Black Badge, Rolls-Royce’s sales grew more than sixfold during his tenure, from 1,000 cars sold in 2010 to more than 6,000 last year.
The average age of a Rolls-Royce buyer fell from 56 to 43. One in 5 buyers today is a celebrity.
“The brand is contemporary today, I would say cool again,” Muller-Otvos told CNBC. “That indicates to me that we got it right, not just me but the entire team. That makes me extremely proud as I look back and see what a fabulous, fabulous journey we had.”
Muller-Otvos also launched Rolls-Royce into its next big chapter with last year’s unveiling of the first fully electric Rolls, called Spectre. The two-door, 577-horsepower behemoth can do zero to 60 in 4.4 seconds and is already sold out in the U.S. through 2025, despite its steep price of more than $413,000.
The big question going forward for Rolls is whether it can maintain its cool factor, and strong sales, if the U.S. economy starts to falter. The U.S. remains its largest market, and while Mutter-Otvos said demand and orders remain strong, the company is always prepared for a correction.
“The luxury market is not immune against any recessionary developments,” he said. “For us, the business is still very strong, but it is on a different level compared to what it used to be right after the pandemic. I would say that has normalized now to levels we are used to, but we are still in a very strong position.”
Muller-Otvos is the longest-serving CEO of Rolls-Royce since Claude Johnson, who brought Charles Rolls and Henry Royce together in 1904 and served until 1926.
Muller-Otvos said when he joined Rolls-Royce, it was an elite brand that was aging fast. Its signature, the four-door Phantom, was designed for chauffeurs to ferry around members of the graying leisure class smoothly and silently. Muller-Otvos visited private bankers around the world to find out how the wealthy were quickly changing — especially with the rise of tech wealth.
“That was quite an eye-opening moment,” he said. “All the private banks told me their clients were getting younger, far more informal and with a lot more women. We said to ourselves, we need something to attract this younger consumer. It needed to be rejuvenated. That’s not something you can do in just two years. That is a long, long story that takes many years to achieve.”
In 2013, Rolls-Royce unveiled the Wraith, a racy, two-door coupe with a twin-turbo V12 that was designed for the wealthy to drive, rather than to be driven in.
That was followed in 2015 by the Dawn convertible, and in 2019 by the Cullinan SUV, which became a favorite of NBA stars and other big athletes. Rolls-Royce debuted the Black Badge line in 2016, featuring higher performance and an all-black color scheme (including the famous Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament).
Muller-Otvos also ushered in a new era of customization, which lured new customers and bigger profit margins. Dubbed “Bespoke,” the program allows Rolls-Royce buyers to choose their own fabrics, paint colors, materials and interior lighting schemes to make a one-of-a-kind Rolls.
The customization program is one reason the average sale price of a Rolls-Royce has doubled since Muller-Otvos took over, to about 500,000 euros ($527,000).
“None of our clients want just a product off the shelf,” he said. “They want it to carry their individual signature and their individual story. We have put a lot of resources into Bespoke and now every car leaving [our factory] is fully bespoke.”"
