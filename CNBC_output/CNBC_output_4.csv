Sarah Whitten,"With booze, furniture and candles, Dungeons & Dragons makes itself at home","In this article
It’s not every day that a spilled beer can start a company. But that’s exactly how Christoff Visscher got the idea for Cantrip Candles.
An avid Dungeons & Dragons fan, Visscher was hosting a game when a beer got knocked over during a rowdy tavern interaction. The malty scent added to the ambiance of the scene and inspired him to start making his own candles and fragrances to elevate his friend’s tabletop gaming experience.
Some seven years later, Visscher’s Cantrip Candles has a physical storefront in Hollywood and nearly two dozen custom scents — from the airy, pine-scented Walk in the Woods to the rich, smoky whiskey and firewood aroma of Black Hound Tavern.
Inspired by fantasy games and settings like those seen in Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder and other popular tabletop role-playing games, Cantrip Candles has created its own lore to pair with its scents. They include Library Scriptorium (parchment, aged wood, leather), Den of Thieves (smoke, red wine, aged leather) and Forest of Fae (jasmine, neroli, tomato leaf and amber), all locations that could be found in any fantasy world.
“We always make it our own,” said Visscher. “And that’s how we can be an authentic to ourselves. Sometimes, we create environments that aren’t the most traditional fantasy environments. We have a scent called Goldwheat Bakery.” It smells like yeast, bread and flour.
Products from the company range from $15 for wax melts all the way up to $99 for 20-ounce centerpiece candles. Cantrip Candles also partners with other small businesses to sell wick trimmers, matches, notebooks, plush and apparel.
Sellers need to be on their game with these customers, too.
“They expect you to respect, understand and anticipate their needs, even though the problems you’re solving can be extremely niche,” said Ed Maranville, co-founder of Wyrmwood, a tabletop gaming accessory and furniture company.
The customer base is growing, and it’s hungry for elevated, luxury merchandise that celebrates and enhances their fandom. It’s more than just T-shirts and special dice. There is a desire to live the fantasy, or at least incorporate it into day-to-day life. Crafters and hobbyists have turned into entrepreneurs creating unique and bespoke merchandise like wooden lamps shaped like 20-sided dice (commonly called d20s), custom wall art and just about any item you can find in a kitchen: cutting boards, glasses, spoons, you name it.
It’s part of a wider trend among many different entertainment franchises, from Marvel and Star Wars to Harry Potter and “Friends,” as well as for fans of regency era romance novels, the horror genre and Broadway musicals.
Dungeons & Dragons was created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in the early 1970s. It is a structured but open-ended role-playing game often played around a table. Players solve puzzles, go on quests and battle enemies. In recent years, due in large part to Covid social-distancing protocols, many games are played virtually using video-conferencing tools.
Hasbro
, which owns the Dungeons & Dragons brand through its subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, has boasted that the game has more than 50 million active players. These consumers have consistently boosted sales for Wizards, pushing the division’s revenue to over $1 billion in each of the last two years.
Hasbro acquired Wizards of the Coast, the company that owned the rights to Dungeons & Dragons, in 1999. The Rhode Island-based toymaker is protective of its intellectual property. It recently tried to revamp its game license to crack down on third-party content creators and boost revenue. However, those plans were shot down in January, as the D&D community balked at the new terms, which were largely viewed as overreaching and unfair.
The company did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment.
The shopper cohort that stocks up on fantasy-themed lifestyle merch is often grouped as “kidults.” Essentially, this customer is 12 or older and spends money on collectibles, toys or merchandise. Last year, these kids-at-heart were responsible for one-quarter of all toy sales annually, around $9 billion worth, and were the biggest driver of growth throughout the industry, according to data from the NPD Group.
Kidults buy other products linked to their interests, like furniture, art and even alcohol. And there are plenty of companies offering up unique, quality products for fantasy tabletop gamers.
“In this community, in most fandoms, if you build something that’s premium, a luxury feeling item, people respond,” said Matthew Lillard, co-founder of Find Familiar Spirits. “The industry sort of discounts their buying power. They’re like, ‘Oh, they just want dice,’ but the reality is that I want something that speaks to me as a modern human. I want to be able to live it on my own.”
Lillard, who rose to fame in the ’90s and early ’00s for roles in films like “Scream” and “Scooby-Doo,” is an avid Dungeons & Dragons player and fan of the fantasy role-playing genre. This week his new company, Find Familiar Spirits, which he founded alongside screenwriter Justin Ware, is launching its first in a series of limited edition whiskeys.
Distilled in Indiana and Kentucky, the first whiskey edition, which has an initial run of 5,000 bottles, is called Paladin, named for the playable class in classic tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. It’s a bourbon whiskey blend with notes of vanilla, fruit and a little spice and will retail for $150.
Three other whiskeys — Rogue, Warlock and Dragon — will roll out at later dates under the banner Quest’s End Whiskey. Early interest in the product has led the company to expand the number of bottles produced going forward.
In total there will be 16 whiskeys, released every three to four months over the course of four years. Each bottle is paired with a booklet that contains a chapter of a new and original fantasy saga called “Dawn of the Unbound Gods.” With every release, a new chapter will be unveiled.
Similarly to Cantrip Candles, Found Familiar Spirits is creating its own lore.
“Our whole thing is that we’re creating an immersive unboxing experience that goes along with the whiskey,” Lillard said. “It does no good to create a beautiful bottle and a s--- whiskey.”
Lillard is no stranger to selling products to this community. In 2018, he co-founded Beadle & Grimm’s, a gaming company that offers licensed expanded editions of Dungeons & Dragons modules, Magic: The Gathering sets and other games in the tabletop role-playing game space.
The company started by selling premium $500 boxes filled with high-end miniatures, maps and props tied to specific Dungeons & Dragons campaigns.
“Our belief is that if you create a high-end premium experience for a whiskey connoisseur, that also loves Dungeons & Dragons, people will turn out to buy and support that,” Lillard said.
Other companies have found similar interest from consumers, particularly those looking to meld their fandom with their dining rooms.
That’s where Wyrmwood Gaming comes in, offering products that serve multiple needs for consumers. In this case, a place to play weekly tabletop role-playing games and have dinner every night.
“Gaming tables serve a need that most consumers have, which is to save space and give them flexibility in their life,” Wyrmwood’s Maranville said. “While some are fortunate enough to have a dedicated space for gaming, for most of us, space is at a premium, and your space for playing games is in either your living room, kitchen or dining area.”
Wyrmwood is known for its high quality wooden accessories and gaming tables, which feature modular pieces that can transform furniture from a dining space to a fantasy landscape. The company first launched on independent online marketplace Etsy
in 2012, offering products that could bring gamers “out of the basement.” The company now has its own website.
“As lifelong gamers, there weren’t a lot of options for finely made accessories,” Maranville said. “Gaming could often still feel like a childish hobby, despite the enormous passion and seriousness that many gamers bring to it, along with their grown-up tastes and budgets.”
Prices range from $600 to more than $10,000 based on table size, shape, wood and other customizations. The company also sells accessories with magnetic components including cup holders, card and poker chip holders, dice trays and bottle openers. Wyrmwood recently extended its line to include a customizable modular desk.
Maranville said he knew the company would thrive nearly a decade ago when Wyrmwood first attended the PAX East convention in 2014. He said patrons gravitated toward the brand because it took their passion seriously and provided merchandise for everyday use.
“We sold out of everything, I completely lost my voice, and our little booth was inundated with attendees all weekend long,” he said."
Mike Calia,‘The Exorcist: Believer’ and Hispanic audiences: A match made in horror movie heaven,"In this article
Take it on faith. The new “Exorcist” movie will draw big Hispanic audiences.
Universal is seeing stronger-than-average Hispanic interest for “The Exorcist: Believer” as the movie heads into its opening weekend, according to people familiar with the matter. This fits a pattern among recent religious-horror releases such as “The Nun II” and “The Pope’s Exorcist.”

“They like the emotions. They like the scary aspect of it. It’s something that’s unique in our culture,” Rolando Rodriguez, the Cuban-born chairman of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said of Hispanic and Latino crowds. “We expect big things out of ‘The Exorcist.’”
“The Exorcist: Believer,” a sequel to the classic 1973 original, tells the story of two girls who disappear for three days in present-day Georgia and end up possessed by a demon, or demons, traumatizing their families and resuming an old battle that is rooted in the first movie. It stars Leslie Odom Jr. of “Hamilton” fame.
The new film is slated to open in more than 3,600 theaters Friday, including Imax
and other premium formats. It’s expected to pull in up to $30 million in its first weekend. While that should be enough to send it to No. 1 at the domestic box office for the weekend, it remains to be seen whether the film and the next two entries in a planned trilogy will pay off for NBCUniversal. The company’s movie studio and streaming service, Peacock, shelled out $400 million for the movies.
“The Exorcist: Believer” also faces a formidable foe in its second weekend: Taylor Swift, who’s releasing the concert film version of her megahit Eras Tour. “Believer” is also entering a crowded horror movie marketplace. Hollywood and indie studios are releasing scary flicks just about every week as Halloween approaches.
“The horror genre is as popular and plentiful as ever, with a consistent demand from audiences driving studios to keep the pipeline flowing with scary movies big and small, with both major and independent studios supplying the seemingly insatiable demand from an adoring fanbase of thrill-seeking moviegoers,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
Hispanic and Latino viewers will have a big say in how “The Exorcist: Believer” does at the box office, no matter what. They tend to represent 26% of horror movie audiences, compared with 20% for other genres, according to the Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak Audience Survey.
“Horror films are a communal experience for Latinos, especially in big cities with multiple cinemas located within blocks of one another,” said R.C. Jara, a film writer who has been published on sites such as Hear Us Scream and Dread Central.
Hispanic audiences’ taste for horror goes back a long way in Hollywood.
In 1931, Universal released a Spanish-language version of the Bela Lugosi film “Dracula,” made with a different cast and crew, that has become a cult classic in its own right. The Oscar-winning career of Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (“Pan’s Labyrinth”) is full of macabre and fantastical tales. Hispanic viewers made up a whopping 44% of the audience during the opening weekend for the new “Saw X.”
Beyond the movies, creepy folk tales about bogeyman El Cucuy and weeping ghost La Llorona go back even further.
“We are a unique blend of ‘the old ways’ and modern Christianity, with a large portion of our members practicing Catholicism specifically,” Angel Melanson, an editor at horror publication Fangoria, told CNBC in an email. “These horror stories aren’t saved for once we come of age and ‘can handle’ them. Instead, they’re freely shared right from the start.”
Religion is at the core of much of the fervor for spooky stuff among the rapidly growing Hispanic population in the United States. As of last year, Catholics accounted for the biggest religious bloc among Latinos, according to Pew Research Center.
The original film “The Exorcist” and its source novel — both written by the late William Peter Blatty, a devout Catholic — are set within the dogma and rituals of Roman Catholicism. They tell the story of a preteen girl (played by Linda Blair in the movie) whose possession by a demon leaves her mother (Ellen Burstyn, who returns in the new film) with no choice but to petition priests (Jason Miller and Max von Sydow) to perform an exorcism.
Some of the story’s most shocking moments come when the demon says blasphemous things and performs profane acts, particularly during a notorious scene involving a crucifix.
“Religious horror is flirting with danger. Something maybe your abuela would yell at you for watching, but doesn’t that make it all the more appealing? Forbidden fruit. A horror story based on things we grow up learning are true and possible,” Melanson said.
Religious horror films resonate deeply with Latino moviegoers in large part because of the emphasis on rituals, experts say.
“Even for modern Latinos who don’t practice Brujeria or cleansings, Catholicism is rife with ritual. So there’s this concept of being able to defeat the demon with ritual, a how-to-survive guidebook of sorts,” Melanson said.
But it’s not unusual to hear atheistic or agnostic horror fans say “The Exorcist” made them believe, if only for two hours. The original movie, released the day after Christmas in 1973, was the kind of must-see event that resulted in lines of moviegoers of all faiths wrapping around blocks to wait for a screening. Hollywood hadn’t released anything like it before, not even Alfred Hitchcock’s classic slasher “Psycho” or the similarly satanic “Rosemary’s Baby,” in terms of shock value.
“The Exorcist” grossed more than $193 million, according to Comscore data. That would still be a big haul for a movie released these days, especially one as explicitly graphic as “The Exorcist.” At its heart, though, the movie is a tense, confrontational theological drama.
“I believe very strongly in God and the power of the human soul,” the late William Friedkin, who directed “The Exorcist,” once said in an interview. “I also believe that they are unknowable. But the film, ‘The Exorcist,’ is primarily about the mystery of faith, the mystery of goodness, that mystery which is inexplicable, but it’s there.”
The new movie’s director, David Gordon Green, is looking to tap into similar ground.
“Whatever faith you subscribe to, there’s always that curiosity, always that interest in the unknown,” Green, who also co-wrote “The Exorcist: Believer” and is set to helm its sequels, told CNBC.
Indeed, Green, who grew up Presbyterian and helps steer HBO’s evangelical comedy “The Righteous Gemstones,” took a small-c catholic approach to the story of the new “Exorcist.” The film opens up the religious sandbox beyond Jesuit priests, also embracing voodoo and evangelical rituals. Catholics don’t have a monopoly on the subject, after all. Possession, Green said, comprises a “huge world” of myths and ideas, from various cultures.
“We may have doubt, we may have certainty, but until we experience something, we don’t really know. There’s something beautiful about that,” he said.
The franchise’s branching out from its Catholic roots mirrors what’s happening among Latinos in the U.S. According to Pew, while Catholicism remains the largest faith among the group, the share of the population who identify as Catholic has fallen dramatically in recent years. Meanwhile, the number of Latinos who aren’t affiliated with any religion is surging. In fact, those ages 18 to 29 are more likely to be unaffiliated than Catholic, according to the study.
“Speaking on behalf of my profoundly Catholic family members, films about serial killers, monsters and especially demonic possession are a means of facing evil vicariously through fiction,” said Jara, reflecting on the genre. “But those of us, like myself, who are agnostic towards the existence of a higher power have found a primary home in horror.”
Still, even as beliefs shift, it’s not “The Exorcist” without religion. The next entry in the planned trilogy is scheduled for release on April 18, 2025 — Good Friday.
Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC and Universal Pictures, the distributor of “The Exorcist: Believer.”"

Popeyes has overtaken KFC as the No. 2 chicken chain in the U.S., a decade after Chick-fil-A first unseated KFC from the top spot.
Chicken chains’ battle for stomachs — and dollars — has become more aggressive in recent years. Chick-fil-A moved from a regional player to a nationwide chain that trails only McDonald’s
and Starbucks
in annual sales. Restaurant Brands International
’s Popeyes launched a chicken sandwich in 2019 that turned into a blockbuster menu item and ushered in the chicken sandwich wars. Burger chains such as McDonald’s and Wendy’s
jumped onto the trend and added their own offerings, leading to poultry shortages.
In the fray, Yum Brands
’ KFC has lost ground. In the past year, its U.S. market share fell to 11.3% from 16.1%, according to Barclays research.
Similar to KFC, Popeyes lost market share in the past year, but still retained enough to leapfrog its rival. The chain saw its U.S. market share shrink to 11.9% from 15%, according to Barclays.
Blame Chick-fil-A, which saw its market share expand to 45.5% from 38.3%. The privately held Atlanta-based chain is more dominant than ever. Chick-fil-A is still closed on Sundays, but industry experts credit its customer service, short menu and efficient drive-thru lanes for its success.
KFC’s domestic business has struggled to keep up with the competition. It took more than a year for KFC to respond to Popeyes’ chicken sandwich. The chain also lost longtime U.S. leader Kevin Hochman last year to Brinker International, where he now serves as CEO.
KFC did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment.
Popeyes, on the other hand, has used the popularity of its chicken sandwich to introduce customers to other menu items and to fuel new restaurant openings. More recently, the chain’s Sweet ’N Spicy Wings became its most popular launch since the chicken sandwich.
“Game on, Chick-fil-A,” Restaurant Brands International Chair Patrick Doyle said in mid-September at Scotiabank’s Back to School Conference, responding to a question about the chain’s new spot as the No. 2 chicken chain.
Popeyes President Sami Siddiqui said in a statement to CNBC that the chain is still in the early innings as it tries to become the most loved and visited U.S. chicken chain.
“We view this special milestone as an indicator that we’re headed in the right direction with much more growth to come,” he said."
Drew Richardson,Clorox says sales and profit took a big hit from cyberattack,"In this article
Clorox
on Wednesday warned that its sales and profit took a big hit during the quarter ending Sept. 30, largely due to the after effects of a cyberattack that significantly affected operations.
The bleach and cleaning products maker said it expects net sales to decrease 23% to 28%. Clorox also estimates its gross margin for the quarter will be down from the year-ago period. It expects to post a per share loss of 35 cents to 75 cents. On an adjusted basis, it projects a loss of up to 40 cents a share.
Clorox also said the cyberattack, which it disclosed in August, continues to hurt production, although the effect is lessening. “The Company also expects to begin to benefit from the restocking of retailer inventories as it ramps up fulfillment” during the current quarter, it said in a release.
Clorox said it is still assessing what effect the hack could have on the current fiscal year and beyond.
The effects of the attack were widescale, the company disclosed in a September securities filing. While operational systems were repaired, Clorox resorted to going manual on many of its procedures, slowing down product fulfillment. Nonetheless, the company has said the threat is contained.
Scattered Spider, a group of hackers tied to recent cyberattacks on casino companies MGM and Caesars, is suspected of being tied to the August attack on Clorox, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. MGM also warned in September that the attack could have a material effect on company finances."
Stefan Sykes,"Tilray Brands’ revenue jumps, losses narrow as it pivots away from cannabis","In this article
Cannabis producer Tilray Brands
 on Wednesday reported a jump in revenue as it diversifies its portfolio and moves deeper into the beer industry.
The company reported $177 million in net revenue, up 15% year over year, for its fiscal first quarter. Its cannabis division brought in $70 million in net revenue, reflecting a 20% spike year over year.
It also narrowed its net loss to $55.9 million during the quarter, compared to a loss of $65.8 million a year earlier.
Tilray is a multinational cannabis company based in Canada, but it has increasingly moved into other segments, particularly the U.S. craft beer industry, as it navigates an uncertain legal environment for marijuana around the world.
The company said it grew cannabis revenue in Canada by 16.5% and strengthened its leading market share position in the country to 13.4%. Canada is one of the few major markets where recreational cannabis is legal at the federal level.
On an earnings call Wednesday, CEO Irwin Simon said the company’s recent beverage mergers and acquisitions will accelerate growth and expand the company’s footprint beyond its recreational cannabis business as the drug remains illegal in key markets in the world, including at the federal level in the U.S. and in much of Europe.
“We’re waiting for legalization to happen in the U.S.,” Simon said separately during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Wednesday. “If it happens, it will be great and we’re well-positioned.”
If legalization in the U.S. doesn’t happen, Simon said the company will fall back on its booming beverage business.
In recent years, the company has been on a buying spree, making deals in what it said are fast-growing markets, such as craft beers and cannabis-infused beverages.
Earlier this week, Tilray completed its acquisition of eight beer brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev
that it had announced over the summer. The company said the deal makes it the fifth largest in the U.S. craft beer market.
Around the same time, the company acquired the remaining 57.5% equity ownership of cannabis-infused drinks maker Truss Beverage from Molson Coors Canada.
The transaction prices of both deals were not disclosed.
Tilray’s beverage alcohol revenue jumped 17% to $24 million in its first quarter, from $21 million in the prior-year period. It cited in part growth in its Montauk Brewing Company subsidiary. Tilray acquired Montauk, a fast-growing brewer in metro New York, in 2022.
“We have strategically diversified our company globally over the past several years and, as a result, Tilray is now ideally positioned to capture a wide range of opportunities across multiple industries,” said Simon in the earnings release."
Sarah Whitten,Disney discounting child tickets at U.S. parks as industry attendance lags,"In this article
It’s about to be cheaper for families to visit Disney’s
domestic theme parks.
The Walt Disney Company on Wednesday announced new, limited time discounts on children’s tickets at Disneyland and Disney World.
Starting Oct. 24, parents can purchase children’s ticket (valid for kids aged three to nine) for the California-based Disneyland resort for as low as $50 each. Tickets can be used between Jan. 8 and March 10 of next year.
As for the Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, children’s tickets and dining plans will be half-off for guests who purchase a four-day, four-night vacation package at one of its resorts. The deal starts Nov. 14 and can be used from March 3 through June 30, 2024.
The price cuts come as the company’s U.S.-based parks have seen a slowdown in attendance and hotel room occupancy as consumers face higher costs due to inflation. Disney is not the only company facing these issues. Universal’s
domestic parks, as well as region players like Six Flags
and Sea World
, have reported lower attendance this year.
Travel agents have pointed to higher ticket prices and a rise in trips to Europe as the major factors in declining domestic theme park attendance.
This is not the first time Disney has offered limited time deals or altered pricing. Earlier this year, the company updated policies at both domestic parks, including modifications to its reservation and ticketing systems for annual pass memberships. The changes came as guests complained about rising prices and longer wait times.
Parks, experiences and products, the division that runs Disney’s parks, has remained a bright spot for the company in recent quarters. Disney has faced ad-related revenue losses within its traditional media business and has had difficulty monetizing its streaming business, as production costs and licensing fees soar.
Meanwhile, the parks division saw a 13% increase in revenue during the third quarter, reaching $8.3 billion.
The company has touted that this segment has expanded at a combined annual growth rate of 6% since 2017, and generated $32.3 billion in operating income over the last 12 months.
Disney is leaning further into the successful business. The company is expected to nearly double its investment in its parks division, with plans to spend around $60 billion over the next 10 years.
Projects already in motion include redesigning Splash Mountain at both domestic resorts with a “Princess and the Frog” theme, as well as updates to existing hotel and resort locations. Disney also plans to nearly double the capacity of its cruise line, adding two ships in fiscal 2025 and another in 2026.
The company provided “blue sky” ideas for its parks during its D23 Expo last year in Anaheim, California. These projects are still in early development and may not see the light of day. This included the possibility of revamping Dino Land at Animal Kingdom in Orlando to be themed as a “Zootopia” or “Moana” area.
At Magic Kingdom, Disney is asking the question: “What is behind Big Thunder Mountain?” The company teased that an area based on “Coco” or “Encanto,” or both, could be in that location. There were also talks about the possibility of bringing to life an area of the Magic Kingdom overrun by Disney villains.
Price points will vary for these projects, if they do come to fruition. The recent additions of the two Star Wars: Galaxy Edge lands in Disneyland and Disney World are estimated to have cost $1 billion each.

Michael Wayland,GM secures new $6 billion credit line as UAW strike costs reach $200 million,"In this article
DETROIT – General Motors
secured a new $6 billion line of credit as the automaker braces for additional strikes by the United Auto Workers union.
“The facility that we announced today is a $6 billion line of credit that I think is prudent in light of some of the messages that we’ve seen from some of the UAW leadership that they intend to drag this on for months,” CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC’s Phil LeBeau in an interview on “Halftime Report.”
The targeted strikes already cost the automaker $200 million during the third quarter, GM said Wednesday.
A GM spokesman said the $200 million strike cost is due to lost production on wholesale volume, largely due to the UAW’s initial Sept. 15 strike at GM’s midsize truck and full-size van plant in Wentzville, Missouri. The strike has since expanded to GM’s parts and distribution facilities nationwide and, as of last Friday, a crossover plant in mid-Michigan.
As a result of the strike in Missouri, GM also idled its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas, where it builds the Cadillac XT4 SUV and the Chevrolet Malibu sedan, and laid off nearly 2,000 workers.
Both GM CEO Mary Barra as well as Ford Motor
CEO Jim Farley have publicly criticized UAW President Shawn Fain and the union’s strike strategy, claiming Fain is not actually interested in reaching deals for 146,000 workers with GM, Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis
.
“It’s clear that there is no real intent to get to an agreement,” Barra said in an emailed statement Friday night. “It is clear Shawn Fain wants to make history for himself, but it can’t be to the detriment of our represented team members and the industry.”
Fain has consistently said the union is available to negotiate 24/7 and has in turn accused the automakers of slow-walking negotiations.
GM’s newly announced line of credit will require the automaker to maintain at least $4 billion in global liquidity and $2 billion in U.S. liquidity. The terms of the credit agreement also restrict GM from mergers or sales of assets and limits on other, new debt. As of June 30, GM’s total automotive liquidity was $38.9 billion.
The credit line comes more than a month after Ford obtained a $4 billion line of credit to help it manage through “uncertainties” in the market."
Michael Wayland,Ford pickup truck sales lead third-quarter growth,"In this article
DETROIT – Ford Motor’s
third-quarter U.S. new vehicle sales increased 7.7% compared with a year earlier, led by higher sales of traditional pickup trucks across its lineup.
The Detroit automaker on Wednesday reported a 15.3% increase in truck sales compared with a 5.1% decline in cars and sales of SUVs that were essentially flat.
Ford’s sales jump was in line with Edmunds’ expectations for the automaker but below auto analyst forecasts for the overall industry of an increase of 15% to 16% for the third quarter.
The automaker’s sales of electric vehicles were up by 14.8% during the quarter to nearly 21,000 units. A vast majority of those sales were the Mustang Mach-E crossover, as sales of the F-150 lightning electric pickup were off about 46% during the quarter due to slower-than-expected demand and downtime at the plant.
Ford’s EV sales represented only about 3% of the roughly 1.5 million vehicles sold by the automaker through the first nine months of the year, including 4.2% of sales during the third quarter.
Ford hybrid sales, led by the F-150 and Maverick hybrid trucks, posted third-quarter sales of 34,861 vehicles – up 41.4% over a year earlier.
An ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers union against the Detroit automakers, including Ford, was not expected to directly impact sales much during the quarter.
Next month could be more challenging due to the strikes, however, especially for vehicles such as the Ford Bronco SUV and Ranger midsize pickup – the first vehicles for the automaker to stop production due to the strikes, which began Sept. 15.
Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with GM, Ford Motor and Stellantis, are part of the work stoppages.
The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began, after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts in which all plants simultaneously strike.
National strikes affect the companies more quickly. The targeted walkouts aim to preserve the union’s funds and prolong the work stoppages to keep the automakers off keel."
Diana Olick,"Mortgage demand drops to the lowest level since 1996, as rates head toward 8%","Mortgage rates just continue to climb higher, taking a particularly big leap last week. As a result, total mortgage demand fell 6% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.53% from 7.41%, with points rising to 0.80 from 0.71 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 6.75% the same week one year ago.
“Mortgage rates continued to move higher last week as markets digested the recent upswing in Treasury yields,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist. “As a result, mortgage applications ground to a halt, dropping to the lowest level since 1996.”
Applications to refinance a home loan dropped 7% for the week and were 11% lower than the same week one year ago. Refinances now make up less than one-third of all mortgage applications. Just two years ago, when rates were setting multiple record lows, refinance demand made up roughly three-quarters of all mortgage applications.
Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 6% for the week and were 22% lower than the same week one year ago.
“The purchase market slowed to the lowest level of activity since 1995, as the rapid rise in rates pushed an increasing number of potential homebuyers out of the market,” said Kan, who also noted that adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) applications increased. The ARMs made up 8% of purchase applications, up from 6.7% about a month ago, when interest rates were slightly lower. ARM’s offer lower rates but are fixed for a shorter term, usually five or 10 years.
A separate, daily survey on mortgage rates from Mortgage News Daily showed the average rate on the 30-year fixed rising even higher this week, hitting 7.72% on Tuesday. Investors are responding to better-than-expected economic data, which could push the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in its higher interest rate policy."

Moderna
on Wednesday said its combination vaccine targeting Covid and the flu will move to a final stage trial in adults ages 50 and above this year after showing positive results in an early to mid-stage study.
The biotech company hopes its shot, mRNA-1083, can win approval from regulators in 2025. 
Moderna and other vaccine makers like Pfizer
believe combination vaccines will simplify what people can do to protect themselves against respiratory viruses that typically surge around the same time of the year.
“Combination vaccines offer an important opportunity to improve consumer and provider experience, increase compliance with public health recommendations, and deliver value for healthcare systems,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. 
“We are excited to move combination respiratory vaccines into Phase 3 development and look forward to partnering with public health officials to address the significant seasonal threat posed to people by these viruses,” he added.
The mRNA-1083 shot generated an immune response similar to or greater than two currently available flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline
in the early to mid-stage clinical trial. 
Moderna’s combination shot also produced an immune response similar to its bivalent Covid vaccine, which targets the omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 and the original strain of the virus. 
The trial evaluated the combination shot in two different age groups: people 50 to 64 years of age and participants 65 to 79. 
The safety data of mRNA-1083 was similar to that of the stand-alone Covid shot, according to Moderna. No new safety concerns were identified with the combination vaccine. 
Moderna is also developing a combination shot targeting the flu and RSV, and another vaccine targeting all three respiratory viruses: Covid, flu and RSV. 
Meanwhile, Pfizer and BioNTech
also are developing a vaccine that targets both Covid and the flu. The companies started a phase one trial for the shot in November and said they expect to launch it in 2024 or later."
Michael Wayland,GM’s third-quarter sales jump 21% as UAW strike slowly expands,"DETROIT – An ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers union against the Detroit automakers had little to no direct effect on General Motors’
third-quarter U.S. new vehicle sales.
The Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported a 21.4% increase in sales from July through September, compared to still subdued sales in the third quarter of 2022, when the industry was still recovering from supply chain issues.
GM’s increase significantly outpaced auto analyst expectations for the overall industry of 15% to 16% for the third quarter. Sales of every one of the Detroit automaker’s brands rose compared to a year earlier.
Not all automakers faired as well as GM in the quarter. But their sales largely climbed in terms of vehicles sold compared to a year ago. Third-quarter sales results reported Tuesday included: Toyota Motor
up 12.2%; Hyundai Motor
up roughly 9%; Kia up about 14%; Mazda up about 22%; and Honda
up roughly 53%.
Stellantis
was an outlier, as sales slid 1.3%. The company’s decline is notable, but not likely to be attributed to the UAW strikes. Stellantis’ sales have struggled as it attempts to retain high profits achieved in recent years by not discounting its vehicles as much as it has historically. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Though work stoppages may not have hit their results yet, GM and other companies likely will face sales and supply chain problems if the UAW’s strike, which began Sept. 15, is expanded or prolonged. Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with GM, Ford Motor
and Stellantis, are part of the work stoppages.
UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began, after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts in which all plants simultaneously strike.
National strikes affect the companies more quickly. The targeted walkouts aim to preserve the union’s funds and prolong the work stoppages to keep the automakers off keel.
The impacts of the strikes will likely begin showing in October for certain vehicles such as the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickups, where work stoppages have affected production, according to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke.
“Thus far, the impact has been fairly muted,” Smoke said in a Friday blog post. “Should the strike against production sites further expand, the more vulnerable products are the large SUVs from Chevrolet and Cadillac, which have tighter inventory levels compared to their domestic rivals.”
For GM, the UAW strikes have hit production of the midsize pickups and Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs.
GM’s sales heading into the fourth quarter were up more than 19% to roughly 1.97 million vehicles sold in the U.S. That included more than 20,000 electric vehicle sales, a 28% increase compared to the second quarter.
Notably, the automaker started selling new electric versions of its Chevrolet Blazer SUV and Silverado pickup during the third quarter. The company also increased production and sales of the Cadillac Lyriq EV and Hummer models during the quarter. However, sales still pale in comparison to Tesla’s electric vehicle deliveries.
During the quarter, GM also was assisted by growth of newer, entry-level models such as the Chevrolet Trax and Buick Envista, both of which are being imported from plants in South Korea."
Leslie Josephs,"United Airlines buys 110 additional Boeing, Airbus jets with delivery slots scarce","In this article
United Airlines
is ordering 110 additional Boeing
and Airbus jetliners, locking in a supply of new planes into the next decade as strong demand and supply chain challenges make new delivery slots scarce.
“We would not normally order jets this far out,” United’s chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, told reporters Tuesday. “Production lines, which are now regularly plagued by supply-chain disruptions and delivery delays, are also increasingly sold out for the entire decade.” Deliveries of the new planes are scheduled to start in 2028.
United’s order consists of 50 more Boeing 787 Dreamliners, adding to a firm order of 100 of the twin-aisle planes it announced last December, along with 50 more options. The airline has aggressively expanded its international service to try to capitalize on a resurgence of trips abroad, destinations that the new long-range 787 planes would serve.
The Chicago-based airline is also buying 60 Airbus A321neos, on top of the 120 it previously had on order with the European manufacturer, including 50 of forthcoming extra-long-range version. United added options for 40 more Airbus A321s.
United and other airlines have recently ordered new planes have said one way around infrastructure constraints is to operate larger aircraft with more seats on them, a practice known as upgauging. The airline said it expects an average of more than 145 seats per North American departure in 2027, up 40% from 2019.
The carrier’s upsized order comes as airlines are battling for new, more fuel-efficient aircraft to cater to the post-Covid travel boom. Delivery delays have left airlines with a shortfall of planes, while upgrades that target an increasing number of travelers willing to splurge on premium seats have also run behind schedule.
United on Tuesday announced a revamp of its bedding and amenities kits for its Polaris business class, which include eye serums and a face spray."
Annika Kim Constantino,"FDA, CDC back Novavax updated Covid vaccine","In this article
Novavax
’s updated Covid vaccine won the backing of the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday, putting the shot on track to roll out weeks after new jabs from Pfizer
and Moderna
reached Americans.
The FDA authorized Novavax’s single-strain vaccine, which targets omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, for emergency use in people ages 12 and up.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is including Novavax’s shot in the same recommendation it issued last month for updated vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. That recommendation says all Americans ages six months and older can receive an updated Covid jab.
Novavax said in a statement that doses of the shot will likely be available within the next few days.
“Novavax’s authorization today means people will now have the choice of a protein-based non-MRNA option to help protect themselves against Covid-19, which is now the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.,” said Novavax CEO John Jacobs in the statement. “In the coming days, individuals in the U.S. can go to major pharmacies, physicians’ offices, clinics and various government entities to receive an updated Novavax vaccine.” 
Public health officials see Novavax’s vaccine as a valuable alternative for people who don’t want to take messenger RNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna, which teach cells how to make proteins that trigger an immune response against Covid. Novavax’s shot fends off the virus with protein-based technology, a decades-old method used in routine vaccinations against hepatitis B and shingles.
Around 2 million Americans have received the updated Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna so far, the Biden administration said last week, even as patients eager to get their dose have been met with unexpected insurance delays and availability issues.
Regardless, all three shots are expected to help the U.S. combat the spread of Covid this fall and winter, when the virus usually spreads at higher levels. 
The nation is already seeing a surge in cases and hospitalizations. While levels remain far below previous Covid waves in the U.S., it’s still the first notable uptick since last winter and has even prompted the return of mask mandates for a handful of businesses and schools. 
The rise is driven by newer strains of the virus that are gaining ground nationwide as XBB.1.5 gradually declines. That includes EG.5, or Eris, an omicron strain that accounted for 29.4% of all cases as of Saturday, according to the CDC. 
A Novavax spokesperson said last month its new Covid vaccine generated a “broad immune response” against Eris and another fast-spreading strain called XBB.1.16.6 – both of which are descendants of omicron.  
But it’s unclear whether the company’s new vaccine will protect against BA.2.86, a highly mutated omicron strain that health officials are watching closely despite its small number of cases. Novavax last month said it was still testing its vaccine against BA.2.86.
The rollout of Novavax’s new shot comes months after the end of the U.S. Covid public health emergency. 
The end of that declaration means all three manufacturers will sell their updated shots directly to health-care providers and vie for commercial market share.  Previously, the government purchased vaccines directly from manufacturers at a discount to distribute to all Americans for free. 
During the advisory meeting last month, Novavax said the list price of its vaccine is $130 per dose.
Federal and corporate programs are aiming to fill the gap for uninsured Americans. That includes the Biden administration’s Bridge Access Program, which will provide Covid vaccines at no cost to underinsured and uninsured people. 
It’s unclear how many Americans will actually roll up their sleeves and take the new vaccines from Novavax, Pfizer and Moderna.
But roughly 42% of Americans surveyed by the CDC in August said they “definitely will” or “probably will” get a Covid shot this fall, Dr. Megan Wallace, a CDC epidemiologist, said during the advisory meeting."
Diana Olick,Popular 30-year mortgage rate races toward 8%,"The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 7.72% on Tuesday, according to Mortgage News Daily.
Mortgage rates follow loosely the yield on the 10-year Treasury
, which has been climbing this week following strong economic data. Rates have not been this high since the end of 2000.
At the beginning of this year, the 30-year fixed rate dropped to about 6%, causing a brief burst of activity in the spring housing market. But it began rising steadily again over the summer, causing sales to drop, despite strong demand. The current trend appears to be even higher, with the possibility of rates crossing over 8%.
The Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates two weeks ago but indicated the possibility of another hike this year and fewer cuts than expected next year. Investors were waiting to see the results of economic data in the first week of October.
“It is now the first week of October, and data has been stronger,” wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. “This morning’s JOLTS (job openings and labor turnover survey) is the biggest, baddest confirmation so far this week, and it’s pushing yields to fresh long-term highs. Pretty simple stuff, actually, even if unpleasant and unfortunate for fans of low rates.”
Higher rates have crushed affordability, hitting both the new and existing home sales markets. While builders had been benefiting from the tight supply of existing homes for sale, higher mortgage rates are a major concern now. Builder sentiment slipped into negative territory in September for the first time in five months.
To put rates in perspective, for a borrower purchasing a $400,000 home with a 20% down payment on a 30-year fixed loan, the monthly payment today is about $930 more than it was when rates were at 3% during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic."
Amelia Lucas,Chipotle tests automation for burrito bowls and salads,"In this article
Chipotle Mexican Grill
is testing whether automation can make customers’ burrito bowls and salads.
It’s the second time the burrito chain has publicly announced testing automation at its innovation center. Chippy, Chipotle’s first foray into automation, is a robot that makes tortilla chips. The company began testing Chippy at a California restaurant a year ago after it passed the first round of testing.
Restaurants ranging from Sweetgreen
to Starbucks
have been investing in automation to cut down on labor costs and improve order consistency and speed. But robotics and artificial intelligence software can be expensive, so it will likely be years before the technology pays off for restaurants.
Still, many operators have big hopes for automation’s future in the restaurant industry. Sweetgreen opened its first automated location in May and CEO Jonathan Neman already expects all of the chain’s future restaurants to be automated in five years.
The Chipotle test announced Tuesday is part of a collaboration with Hyphen, a startup that’s trying to automate restaurant kitchens. Last year, Chipotle invested an undisclosed amount in Hyphen, formerly known as Ono Food. The startup has a valuation of $104 million, according to PitchBook.
All Chipotle restaurants have two make lines to assemble orders: one in the front for diners who order in person and another in the kitchen for digital orders. Roughly two-thirds of all Chipotle digital orders are either burrito bowls or salads, according to Chipotle.
The Hyphen robot will make burrito bowls and salads for digital orders only. The technology moves the bowls underneath the digital make line to dispense the correct ingredients. Simultaneously, an employee can assemble digital orders for other items, such as tacos, quesadillas and burritos, on the digital make line. When the robot is done making an order, it sends the bowl or salad back up to the surface so employees can properly package the order."
Robert Frank,"There’s a shortage of luxury apartments in Manhattan, and it’s driving up prices","A shortage of luxury apartments in Manhattan is causing a surge in prices at the top of the market, even as broader apartment sales and prices come under pressure from rising mortgage rates.
Manhattan apartment sales fell 23% in the third quarter as rising interest rates squeezed potential buyers, according to new data from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. Median and average sales prices remained flat, with the average price of a Manhattan apartment stalled at $1.96 million and the median price at $1.15 million.
The high end of the market, however, has seen a big drop in supply and stronger prices.
The supply of luxury apartments — defined as the top 10% of the market by price — has plunged 24% compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to Miller Samuel. The inventory of luxury apartments for sale marked their lowest third quarter in five years.
Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, said high-end buyers are typically less sensitive to mortgage rates since they often pay in cash. As a result, the wealthy have continued buying and taking advantage of more attractive prices.
At the same time, newly built condominium towers have been the main driver of high-end sales since the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, most of those new, high-priced condominiums have been sold — and few new projects are being launched due to a lack of bank lending.
“A lot of that new development inventory sold off during the pandemic boom,” Miller said. “The higher end of the market is seeing much less of a contribution from new development sales.”
With fewer new luxury condominium towers now under construction, prices at the high end could continue to rise or remain strong, brokers say.
According to Serhant, there were nine sales of Manhattan apartments priced at $20 million or more in the third quarter, compared to just two during the same period last year.
Median prices for luxury apartments have increased in three of the past four quarters, according to Miller Samuel. By contrast, overall median prices in Manhattan have been down for four quarters in a row.
“There is clearly more strength at the higher end than the overall market,” Miller said."
Sarah Whitten,Beyonce is coming to save the day for the weak December box office,"In this article
Movie theaters will become a Bey Hive this December.
Hot off the heels of a distribution deal to bring Taylor Swift’s filmed Eras Tour to cinemas, AMC Entertainment
has partnered with Parkwood Entertainment to bring a documentary on Beyonce’s Renaissance album and tour to theaters.
The film will appear in theaters on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays for around four weeks starting Dec. 1. Tickets will start at $22 for standard showtimes, with premium large format screens like IMAX and Dolby Cinema available for a higher fee. The movie will screen at a variety of theaters nationwide, including AMC, Regal and Cinemark
, Cinepolis, Cineplex and Harkins.
Beyonce’s appearance on the film calendar is a much-needed boon for the North American box office. The film industry is still in recovery mode after the pandemic and has seen fewer releases in recent years, leading to fewer ticket sales.
“Early December is a historically slow period between the Thanksgiving and Christmas corridors with very few high-profile new releases,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “This year’s slate during that time was certainly a bit thin before Beyonce staked her claim. There’s no question, having her fans come out to support her music and artistry on the big screen will fill some of that gap and continue to change how the industry approaches rare but occasional dead zones on the calendar when Hollywood studios aren’t releasing blockbusters.”
So far, the big releases during the month of December are dominated by three Warner Bros.
titles — “Wonka” hits theaters Dec. 15, followed by “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” on Dec. 20 and “The Color Purple” on Christmas Day.
Those offerings give Beyonce’s movie plenty of room to run at the box office.
“The cultural impact, brand enhancement and, of course, revenue-generating potential is clearly a motivating factor in the decision to go with a theatrical rather than a streaming release,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
It’s unclear what Beyonce’s film could open to in December, as tickets just went on sale Monday. Industry observers expect Swift’s concert film, due in theaters Oct. 13, will open to at least $100 million in ticket sales.
By the end of Swift’s international tour dates next year, music analysts predict the star’s Eras Tour will have generated between $1 billion and $1.4 billion in revenue. Beyonce’s tour looks to top out just above $560 million.
The Beyonce and Swift releases also are part of AMC’s new revenue-generation strategy. The theater chain, in bypassing the traditional studio release model, will pick up distribution fees as well as share in the ticket sales.
AMC, in particular, needs this kind of revenue, as the company continues to spend more on film-licensing costs and theater rentals than it makes in ticket and concession sales. In fact, the company only recently posted a profit during its second quarter this year, having generated net income of just $8.6 million.
“This is another savvy move by creators and exhibitors that bolsters the bottom line for movie theaters at year’s end while uncovering more unexplored potential from specialty event releases,” Robbins said.
AMC, and other movie theater chains, will also benefit from elevated concession sales as moviegoers load up on popcorn and soda for these concert films. AMC is already promoting collectible Taylor Swift popcorn tubs for $14.99 and cups for $11.99. No doubt, Beyonce-themed items will be revealed soon.
“The theaters have been playing live or recorded concerts for over a year now and began talking about alternative content possibilities two years ago, but the scale of Taylor Swift and Beyonce is certainly bringing more attention to this strategy,” said Alicia Reese, analyst at Wedbush. “It will be difficult to find other acts of this scale, but there are plenty of artists who will be touring next summer and theaters will likely be reaching out to schedule concert films to fill any gaps in the 2024 summer release slate.”
Those gaps have come from production delays related to the two Hollywood labor strikes. The box office saw several titles leave for 2024 release dates and its still unclear where currently scheduled titles will wind up once the dust settles."
Melissa Repko,"Macy’s will open up to 30 stores, as it looks to strip malls for growth","In this article
Macy’s
on Tuesday said it will open up to 30 smaller stores in strip malls over the next two years, as the retailer chases customers out of dying malls and into bustling suburbs.
The company did not announce locations, but said the additional stores will start to open next year.
The expansion marks an inflection point for the department store operator, which has looked for ways to refresh its legacy brand, cope with dwindling mall traffic and compete with retailers that have stolen away shoppers. Macy’s has faced even more challenges in the past six months, as middle-income Americans — who drive most sales at its namesake stores and website — watch their spending and rack up debt on their credit cards. The company cut its full-year forecast this summer and expects weak sales to persist.
Chief Stores Officer Marc Mastronardi said small-format stores are part of the solution. Macy’s has tested the shops, which are roughly one-fifth the size of its traditional mall stores, for nearly four years. The stores offer a slimmed-down mix of merchandise, host local events, and have a more modern and open look. Plus, they’re next to big-box stores, grocers and popular off-price retailers like TJX
-owned T.J. Maxx.
“The high level of convenience in places that have a lot of traffic — that’s been the secret sauce,” Mastronardi said.
The off-mall stores have put up stronger results than the rest of Macy’s. And based on the company’s own shopper surveys, the stores get high marks for being easy to shop, neat, and staffed by helpful and friendly employees, Mastronardi said.
Macy’s small-format stores open for more than one fiscal year have posted comparable sales growth on an owned-plus-licensed basis from the beginning of the fiscal year, which began in late January, through the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 29. Comparable sales, a retail industry metric, aims to take out the impact of store openings, closures and renovations to allow better year-over-year comparisons.
Across the rest of the company, comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis declined by roughly 7% in both the fiscal first quarter and fiscal second quarter. Along with Macy’s namesake stores, that metric includes trends at higher-end department store Bloomingdale’s and beauty chain Bluemercury, which have generally outperformed the namesake stores.
By the end of this year, Macy’s will have 15 of the smaller stores, not including the announced expansion. Three are Bloomie’s, a smaller version of the Macy’s-owned Bloomingdale’s. The up to 30 new stores that are coming will be called Macy’s. The company is phasing out Market by Macy’s, the name it initially used for the smaller Macy’s stores.
Macy’s has dealt with the skepticism from investors who often link its fate with those of struggling shopping malls. Shares of the company have largely been on a downward trend since 2015. So far this year, the company’s stock is down about 44% even as the S&P 500 has risen about 12% during the same time period.
Led by CEO Jeff Gennette, the company has focused on five growth drivers, including off-mall expansion. It has also refreshed and debuted new private brands, launched a third-party marketplace online, focused on luxury brands, and increased personalized offers and communication with customers.
Gennette will soon pass the reins to Tony Spring, CEO of Bloomingdale’s, as he retires early next year.
Oliver Chen, a senior equity research analyst at Cowen who covers retail and luxury goods, said Macy’s is under pressure to appeal to younger consumers and differentiate from competitors. Those rivals include specialty retailers like Ulta Beauty
and Sephora and off-price retailers or fast-fashion players where shoppers may get a better deal or superior service.
″[Macy’s leaders] don’t have their head in the mud,” he said. “They understand the need to be relevant and grow and to think about off-mall.”
He pointed to some signs of progress, including the return of Nike
and Under Armour
merchandise to stores and its website and the launch of a new women’s private brand, On 34th.
Shoppers who have come to the smaller stores look similar to Macy’s typical customer, but have a more curated mix of merchandise to choose from since stores are smaller, Mastronardi said. Popular categories at the small-format stores have been toys, beauty and career apparel, according to the company.
Macy’s has opened the stores in three different kinds of markets. In some cases, it has put them in areas that already have a large store, but also have high demand. It has used others to replace stores in floundering malls. Macy’s has also broken into new regions where it does not have stores.
Mastronardi said the company has tracked sales data in markets where Macy’s has a typical mall store and an off-mall store. He said the retailer has not seen signs of the new shops cannibalizing its existing stores, where sales just move from one to the other.
“What we’re seeing is it’s really just an extra visit into the Macy’s brand,” he said."
Drew Richardson,Krispy Kreme puts Insomnia Cookies up for sale as it doubles down on doughnuts,"In this article
Krispy Kreme
is exploring strategic alternatives, including an all-cash sale, of its majority stake in Insomnia Cookies, the company said Tuesday.
The decision is part of an effort to focus more on its core doughnut business, the company said.
Krispy Kreme acquired control of Insomnia Cookies in 2018 in a deal backed by European investment firm JAB Holding. The deal valued Insomnia Cookies at less than $500 million, sources told CNBC at the time.
“We acquired a majority stake in Insomnia Cookies to build our e-commerce and digital capability as well as assist Insomnia’s U.S. and International expansion,” said Krispy Kreme CEO Mike Tattersfield in a statement. “Both efforts have been successful and it’s time for the next strategic step for both companies.”
Krispy Kreme went public for the second time in 2021, at an implied valuation of $2.7 billion. The doughnut chain first went public in 2000 but was taken private in a sale to JAB Holding in 2016.
Insomnia Cookies, which is known for serving cookies well into the early morning hours, has tripled its revenue since 2017, Krispy Kreme said Tuesday. The cookie chain has expanded from more than 135 locations in 2018 to 250 locations today.
The cookie chain was founded in 2003 by University of Pennsylvania student Seth Berkowitz, who is CEO of Insomnia Cookies. The bakeries are often found near college campuses to feed the cravings of students staying up late into the night.
“It has been an honor to partner with Krispy Kreme in an unprecedented chapter of growth for Insomnia Cookies,” Berkowitz said in a statement."
Annika Kim Constantino,Drugmakers opt in to Medicare drug price negotiations – here’s what happens next,"In this article
All drugmakers of the first 10 medicines selected for Medicare drug price negotiations have agreed to participate in the talks, even after many of them sued to halt the process last month.
The companies confirmed their participation in separate statements to CNBC on Monday.
The White House on Tuesday confirmed that all drugmakers agreed to engage in the price talks.
“Today I can announce that the manufacturers of ten drugs are coming to the negotiating table to lower prices,” President Joe Biden said in a video on X, formerly known as Twitter. “They’re taking steps to participate in the negotiating program so we can give seniors the best possible deal.”
Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which passed last year, empowered Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time in the program’s six-decade history. The lengthy negotiation process won’t end until August 2024, with reduced prices going into effect in January 2026.
Sunday was the deadline for all 10 pharmaceutical companies to sign an agreement to engage in the negotiations, which aim to make costly medications more affordable for older Americans.
Monday, meanwhile, is the deadline for those companies to submit economic and market information on their drugs, including research and development costs and sales and revenue data. 
Here are the 10 drugs and the companies that manufacture them: 
Many of the drugmakers contend that they had no real choice but to participate in the negotiations, specifically due to the penalties they could face if they choose not to.
If drugmakers decline to engage in the negotiations, they could be forced to pay an excise tax of up to 95% of their medication’s U.S. sales or to pull all of their products from the Medicare and Medicaid markets, according to CMS.
“We have no choice other than to sign the ‘agreement.’ If we did not sign, we’d be required to pay impossibly high penalties unless we withdraw all of our medicines from Medicare and Medicaid. That is not a real choice,” a spokesperson for Bristol Myers Squibb told CNBC ahead of the Sunday deadline.
That statement echoes the arguments outlined in at least nine separate lawsuits drugmakers filed against the Biden administration in recent months seeking to declare the negotiations unconstitutional.
The pharmaceutical industry also argues that the process will threaten revenue growth, profits and drug innovation.
However, analysts expect minimal financial losses for companies, at least initially, since most of the drugs selected already face upcoming patent expirations that will likely weigh on revenue.
This fall, CMS will host one meeting with all 10 companies so they can provide context for the data they submitted by Monday. 
CMS will also host listening sessions with consumer and patient organizations to obtain information the agency can use to develop its initial price offers for the selected drugs. 
CMS will then make an initial price offer to manufacturers in February, and the companies have a month to accept or make a counteroffer. 
The negotiations will end in August, with agreed-upon prices published on Sept. 1, 2024. The reduced prices won’t go into effect until Jan. 1, 2026.
After the initial round of talks, CMS can negotiate prices for another 15 drugs for 2027 and an additional 15 in 2028. The number rises to 20 negotiated medications a year starting in 2029 and beyond.
CMS will only select Medicare Part D drugs for the medicines covered by the first two years of negotiations. It will add more specialized drugs covered by Medicare Part B, which are typically administered by doctors, in 2028. 
The drug price talks are expected to save Medicare an estimated $98.5 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
The negotiations are also anticipated to save money for people enrolled in Medicare, who take an average of four to five prescription drugs a month and increasingly face out-of-pocket costs that many struggle to afford. "
Sarah Whitten,Late-night shows return as actors restart negotiations with Hollywood studios,"In this article
Now that the Hollywood writers’ strike is over, late-night hosts are preparing their first opening monologues since May, and actors are going back to the negotiating table with studios.
After nearly 150 days on the picket lines, the Writers Guild of America struck a tentative deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers last week, allowing writers to return to work and striking actors to start up their negotiations. WGA membership is currently in the process of voting on the contract, with expectations that ratification will come late next week.
The first people to return are late-night heavyweights Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert on Monday, followed by John Oliver, host of “Last Week Tonight,” on Sunday.
Meyers, host of “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” spent much of his pre-strike shows commenting on former President Donald Trump’s compounding legal problems. He noted that his first show back will be an hourlong “Closer Look” segment, a recap of news items.
“I’m so excited to be back, but I didn’t pay attention to the news at all the last five months ... I hope I didn’t miss like three indictments,” Meyers joked on “Today” Monday.
The WGA secured pay increases in each of the next three years, artificial intelligence restrictions and a new residual system for streaming based on viewership. The guild also negotiated higher contribution rates to health benefits and pensions, as well as a guaranteed number of writers in writers rooms for television shows.
Now it’s the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists’ turn.
The actors guild begins its negotiations with the likes of Disney, Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday.
SAG-AFTRA is looking to improve wages, working conditions and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV. The guild is also looking to standardize the self-tape process.
Industry players expect the negotiations will be quick, with the WGA deal as a template.
Still, even if a tentative agreement is reached in the next few weeks, Hollywood will be slow to restart production on films and television shows. Not only will SAG-AFTRA members need to vote on the new contract, which could take a week or more, but there will be a scramble to gather crews and cast back to their respective sets.
In a situation that would be similar to the return from pandemic restrictions, productions will be competing for studio space, locations and talent schedules. This could become increasingly tricky as the holiday season approaches, a time when production typically slows down.
In addition, productions that were shooting internationally during the strike, like Warner Bros.′ “Beetlejuice 2,” Universal’s “Wicked,” and Disney and Marvel’s “Deadpool 3,” may need to wait for those crews to wrap up projects before returning to work on U.S.-based productions.
Some studios have already indicated they will wait until next year to resume production. This means that post-production processes will also be delayed — including, editing and special effects. It’s unclear what impact that could have on the release calendar for upcoming film and TV shows.
Already, Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment’s “Dune: Part Two” fled to 2024 as did Sony’s “Kraven the Hunter” and “Ghosbusters: Afterlife” sequel.
And much of the reason “Dune: Part Two” departed the calendar was because its cast could not promote the film during the strike. Once SAG-AFTRA makes a deal with the AMPTP, those stars will be able to return to late-night shows to drum up interest for films.
That could be particularly important for Academy Award hopefuls set for release later this year.
In the meantime, late-night hosts will look elsewhere for guests. Meyers said viewers can expect to see politicians, journalists and authors as guests on the show until actors are permitted to promote their upcoming projects.

Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Oddity expects revenue growth up to 31%, according to preliminary Q3 results","In this article
Oddity Tech
released preliminary third-quarter results on Monday that show expected revenue growth of 29% to 31%, driven by repeat sales at its Il Makiage and Spoiled Child brands.
The newly public retailer, which started trading on the Nasdaq in July and uses artificial intelligence to develop products, had previously expected sales to grow by about 20.5% in the three months ended Sept. 30. 
The Tel Aviv-based company didn’t share its exact sales figure for the quarter, but in the year ago period, it posted $68.9 million in revenue, finance chief Lindsay Drucker Mann told CNBC.
The company is also now expecting a gross margin of 68.5% for the period, one percentage point higher than its previous guidance of 67.5%, and margins on its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to be at the high end of its previous range. Oddity is now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 21% to 21.5%, compared to its initial guidance of 20% to 21.5%. 
So far this year, sales have jumped by about 58% with adjusted EBITDA of at least $89 million, Oddity said. 
“It was strength across the board, upside from both Il Makiage and Spoiled Child. At the end of the day, our repeat revenues were stronger than we had expected and importantly, those sales were of very high quality so they came with some very strong profitability associated with them,” Drucker Mann said in an interview. 
“We have these machine learning models at almost every part of the user journey. They’re responsible for the high satisfaction, which leads to our great repeat rates, it drives our strong profitability and our high growth. Without these models, we would never be able to print these results, we would just be another unprofitable [direct-to-consumer] company.” 
Oddity is on a mission to disrupt the legacy beauty and wellness industry by using AI to not just select products for customers, but to develop them as well. It often boasts that it doesn’t hire from the legacy beauty industry and instead focuses on recruiting technologists, many of whom came from the Israeli Defense Forces’ best technology units.
In April, it announced plans to acquire biotech startup Revela and open the Boston-based Oddity Labs in a bid to make cosmetics that address age-old problems like hair loss and wrinkles. The lab is tasked with using AI to create brand-new molecules – a common tool used in the pharmaceutical industry to create new drugs, but one that isn’t widely used in the beauty and wellness industry. 
In a statement, CEO Oran Holtzman said Oddity Labs is expanding faster than expected and “delivering game changing ingredient innovation.”
The company expects Oddity Labs to have 10 products ready for market in 2024. Over the next five years, it expects Oddity Labs to drive 30% or more of the company’s overall revenue, said Drucker Mann. 
When Oddity first debuted on the public markets over the summer, it began trading with a 35% pop and saw its stock close at $47.53. Soon after, it reached a high of $56 per share but since then, Oddity’s stock has fallen by about 50%, with shares closing at $28.08 on Monday.
Drucker Mann said Oddity’s share price, along with the share price of other companies that recently went public, reflects “the natural ebb and flow of risk sentiment in the early stages of a market recovery.”
“Momentum can drive the short term, but fundamentals drive the long term and our fundamental story is super exciting, so we’re feeling really confident,” she said."

The Federal Communications Commission announced a settlement with Dish Network
on Monday in the regulator’s first penalty related to space debris.
Dish admitted it was liable for failing to properly dispose of the EchoStar-7 broadcast communications satellite, and agreed to pay a fee of $150,000, the FCC said. The FCC called the agreement “a breakthrough settlement” in the increasingly concerning realm of space debris, brought on by governments and companies launching satellites into orbit at an unprecedented rate.
“As satellite operations become more prevalent and the space economy accelerates, we must be certain that operators comply with their commitments,” FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Loyaan Egal said in a statement.
Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter.
Dish launched the EchoStar-7 satellite in 2002 and planned to remove it from service in May 2022. But a few months before then, Dish found the satellite did not have enough fuel remaining to navigate to a disposal location.
The company had previously agreed to an “orbital debris mitigation plan” with the FCC to relocate the satellite. Instead of retiring the satellite 300 kilometers away from where it was operating in geostationary orbit, Dish retired the satellite about 122 kilometers away, “well short of the disposal orbit,” the FCC noted.
Dish did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on the settlement."
John Rosevear,Rivian reports better-than-expected EV deliveries for the third quarter,"In this article
Rivian Automotive on Monday reported record third-quarter electric vehicle deliveries and said it remains on track to produce 52,000 EVs in 2023.
The company said it delivered 15,564 vehicles during the period, up 23% from the second quarter of 2023 and ahead of Wall Street estimates. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected Rivian to deliver about 14,000 vehicles in the quarter, on average.
Rivian produced 16,304 vehicles during the third quarter, all at its factory in Normal, Illinois.
Shares ended the day down over 2% on Monday.
The company also confirmed that it remains on track to build 52,000 vehicles in 2023, in line with its previous guidance to investors. Rivian currently builds a series of delivery vans for Amazon
as well as its own R1T pickup and R1S SUV. All are fully electric vehicles.
Rivian took several steps earlier this year to reduce spending and bolster its balance sheet, including a 6% staff reduction in February and a $1.3 billion sale of convertible notes in March. The company also delayed the launch of its upcoming smaller R2 vehicle platform to 2026, from 2025. It had $10.2 billion in cash on hand as of June 30, its most recent update.
Rivian will announce its third-quarter earnings result after the U.S. markets close on Nov. 7."
Amelia Lucas,Fast-food drive-thru lanes speed up as fewer drivers wait in line,"Fast-food drive-thru lanes are speeding up as fewer customers choose to order their meals and milkshakes sitting in their car, according to an annual study by Intouch Insight released Monday.
The average total time spent in a drive-thru lane shrank 29 seconds this year. Wait times to order were 25 seconds shorter, as the average number of cars in line to place orders fell from 2.76 to 1.27.
The Intouch Insight study was based on visits to nearly 1,500 locations of Arby’s, Burger King, Carl’s Jr., Chick-fil-A, Dunkin’, Hardee’s, KFC, McDonald’s, Taco Bell and Wendy’s. Mystery shoppers ordered from the drive-thru lanes during a range of times between June and July.
Taco Bell, KFC and Carl’s Jr. had the fastest overall times for their drive-thru lanes. But Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s
and Wendy’s
bested all three chains when their longer average total times were divided by the number of cars in line. In other words, Carl’s Jr and Yum Brands’
Taco Bell and KFC were only speedier because their drive-thru lanes weren’t as popular.
But across the board, drive-thru lanes have waned in demand since the Covid-19 pandemic began. At that time, customers shifted from ordering inside to ordering from their cars. The trend continued even as fast-food restaurants reopened their dining rooms.
But the surge in popularity put pressure on workers to assemble orders quickly and accurately, and fast-food chains had to come up with solutions such as curbside pickup for mobile orders to address the problem. Despite those efforts, this year’s total drive-thru times still lag 2019 times by 15 seconds.
Many diners have now shifted to ordering online or using self-order kiosks inside restaurants.
Even as drive-thru visits stabilize, restaurant companies such as McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A are still working to speed up service and reduce errors. Some are testing artificial intelligence software to take orders or are building new locations with as many as four drive-thru lanes.
Intouch Insight’s mystery shoppers visited two special restaurants this year: a McDonald’s test restaurant outside of Fort Worth, Texas, with an order-ahead lane and a drive-thru lane, along with a Taco Bell location in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, with one traditional drive-thru lane and three additional lanes reserved for delivery drivers and customers who ordered ahead.
Both locations’ service times outperformed their broader brands’ times by roughly a minute. The Taco Bell restaurant also outperformed on order accuracy with a score of 88%, versus the chain’s rate of 85%. But the McDonald’s test location fell short with an accuracy score of 80%, well below the chain’s rate of 88%."

Amelia Lucas,Big Food vs. Big Pharma: Companies bet on snacking as weight loss drugs boom,"In this article
For more than a century, frosted cornflakes have been the backbone of Kellogg’s
business. That changes Monday, when the company will spin off its stable cereal business in favor of its faster-growing snack unit and rename itself Kellanova.
The spinoff comes weeks after another wager that consumers will graze between meals, when J.M. Smucker
bought Twinkie maker Hostess Brands for $5.6 billion in a bid to expand its snack lineup.
But food companies’ major bets on snacking come as investors fear the looming danger of Big Pharma’s blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Many investors have high hopes for the pharmaceuticals’ future, but their success could mean slower sales for the companies that produce Oreos, Doritos and Hershey’s Kisses.
Big Food’s bet on snacking began roughly a decade ago, and it’s only accelerated as the rest of the grocery aisles see sales stagnate, particularly as prices rise. The U.S. market for savory snacks is expected to grow 6% annually from 2022 through 2027, and sweet snacks’ sales are expected to rise 4.6% annually during that time, according to HSBC. Roughly three-quarters of consumers plan to snack every day, according to Accenture data.
Millennials and Generation Z consumers are fueling the trend. Younger generations snack more often than older consumers, said Kelsey Olsen, food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel. Millennials and Gen-Z consumers tend to eat smaller meals that are closer together, creating more occasions to grab a snack.
At the same time, Novo Nordisk’s
Ozempic and Wegovy have taken off, fueled by prescriptions to help patients lose weight. The drugs, known as GLP-1 agonists, suppress appetites by mimicking a gut hormone. Some patients even report developing aversions to foods with higher sugar and fat content — a category that includes many big snack brands.
More than 9 million prescriptions for these kinds of drugs were written in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to a Trilliant Health report.
Morgan Stanley estimates that the number of patients taking GLP-1 drugs could reach 24 million, or nearly 7% of the U.S. population, by 2035.
If so, consumption of baked goods and salty snacks could fall 3% — or even more if the new eating habits of the people using the treatments extend to their broader households and friends, according to Morgan Stanley’s research. That puts companies like Hershey
, Mondelez
, PepsiCo
, General Mills
and Kellogg’s successor Kellanova at risk.
But not everyone in the industry agrees with that assessment.
After buying Hostess Brands, Smucker CEO Mark Smucker defended the future of Twinkies and Ding Dongs against the threat of GLP-1 drugs.
“There are multiple ways that consumers will continue to snack. … And given that consumers are going to continue to seek all different types of snacks, and sweet snacks are going to continue to be on the radar, we view that our projections here are sound,” he told analysts on a conference call.
For one, GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic are expensive, with a list price of roughly $1,000 a month. That high price has led some insurers to decide not to cover the treatments.
While some of the nation’s largest insurers, like CVS’s
Aetna, cover prescriptions of these drugs, the federal Medicare program, many state Medicaid programs and some commercial insurers don’t, leaving patients to pick up the bills themselves.
Another factor could work in the favor of snack sales. Many of the consumers who eat the most junk food likely won’t be able to afford Wegovy or Ozempic.
“Consumption of indulgent salty snacks that would be considered ‘junk food’ generally over-indexes toward lower-income individuals, who are unlikely to be these drugs’ primary users, ” RBC analyst Nik Modi said in a research note Tuesday.
Modi wrote that he doesn’t believe the drugs will ultimately be problematic for the manufacturers of salty snacks.
What’s more, patients have to inject themselves once a week, and if they stop taking the treatments, their effects disappear, usually erasing any weight loss that had occurred over time.
“This sort of drug is super interesting in what it can do, but I think until it comes in a radically different formulation, in a pill or something like that, and something that has enduring impact and obviously the much lower price point, I think it’s going to be tricky,” said Oliver Wright, senior managing director of Accenture’s consumer goods and services unit.
Even if the drugs become more affordable and are more widely adopted, the change won’t happen overnight. Food companies will have time to adjust to shifting consumer behavior.
“We acknowledge that the impact in the near term is likely to be limited given drug adoption will grow gradually over time, but we could see a longer-term impact as drug prevalence increases,” Morgan Stanley’s Paula Kaufman wrote in a note to clients. “Moreover, we expect companies to adapt to changes in consumer behavior through innovation and portfolio reshaping efforts.”
That may mean slower sales growth than expected and moves to divest some brands. But Big Food has been making strides toward healthier options anyway. GLP-1 drugs could just put more pressure on companies to update their portfolios.
PepsiCo and Mondelez are among the companies that have snapped up smaller brands that make healthier snacks. Still, growing them into global powerhouses will take time.
Food companies are also looking internally, investing in their research and development teams to create new formulations that mirror the taste of their full-sugar and salt versions.
“My prediction is, before the end of the decade, we will have a healthy Oreo that can be put on a plate with an old one, and consumers won’t be able to tell them apart — and that will be a good thing,” Accenture’s Wright said.

Annika Kim Constantino,Federal judge declines to block Medicare drug price negotiations,"A federal judge on Friday declined to block the Biden administration from implementing Medicare drug price negotiations, upholding for now a controversial process that aims to make costly medications more affordable for older Americans.
Judge Michael Newman of the Southern District of Ohio issued a ruling denying a preliminary injunction sought by the Chamber of Commerce, one of the largest lobbying groups in the country, which aimed to block the price talks before Oct. 1.
That date is the deadline for manufacturers of the first 10 drugs selected for negotiations to agree to participate in the talks.
The Chamber sued the Biden administration in June, arguing that the drug negotiations violate the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the separation of powers.
“As to Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, they have demonstrated neither a strong likelihood of success nor irreparable harm. Consequently, their request for immediate preliminary injunctive relief...is denied,” Newman, a nominee of former president Donald Trump, wrote in his 28-page order.
But Newman also declined to grant the Biden administration’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit entirely.
Instead, he asked the Chamber to amend its complaint by Oct. 13 to clarify certain details in the case.
Newman also gave the Biden administration until Oct. 27 to renew its motion to dismiss the case.
He said “a final determination on standing issues will be made following a short (60-day) discovery period and—assuming they are filed—renewed motions to dismiss.”
The ruling from Newman is a blow to the pharmaceutical industry, which views the process as a threat to its revenue growth, profits and drug innovation.
President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in a party-line vote last year, gave Medicare the power to directly hash out drug prices with manufacturers for the first time in the federal program’s nearly 60-year history
The Chamber, which represents some companies in the industry, and drugmakers like Merck
and Johnson & Johnson
filed at least eight separate lawsuits in recent months seeking to declare the negotiations unconstitutional. But the Chamber’s suit was the only one seeking a preliminary injunction. 
The Chamber’s lawsuit argues that the program violates drugmakers’ due process rights under the Fifth Amendment by giving the government the power to effectively dictate prices for their medicines.
The Chamber said an appeals court established a precedent that when the government sets prices, it must provide procedural safeguards to ensure a company receives a reasonable rate and fair return on investment. It stems from the 2001 case Michigan Bell Telephone Co. v. Engler, according to the Chamber.
The Medicare negotiations do not provide these safeguards and impose price caps that are well below a drug’s market value, the Chamber argued.
“There is a very, very high risk, maybe a guarantee, but certainly a very, very high risk, that this regime will result in prices that are unfair,” Jeffrey Bucholtz, an attorney for the Chamber, told judge Newman during a hearing earlier this month.
He added that drugmakers either must agree to the price the government sets, or face an excise tax of up to 1,900% of U.S. sales of the drug.
But lawyers for the DOJ said during the hearing that the program was far from compulsory. Drugmakers can choose the alternative to those two options: Withdraw their voluntary participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, according to attorney Brian Netter. 
“The measure of relief here is for manufacturers to decide whether they want to stay in the program under the terms that are on offer,” Netter said. “If they choose not to, that’s their prerogative.”
The other suits are scattered in federal courts around the U.S.
Legal experts say the pharmaceutical industry hopes to obtain conflicting rulings from federal appellate courts, which could fast-track the issue to the Supreme Court. 
Medicare covers roughly 66 million people in the U.S., according to health policy research organization KFF. The drug price talks are expected to save the insurance program an estimated $98.5 billion over a decade, the Congressional Budget Office said. 
In August, the Biden administration unveiled the 10 drugs that will be subject to the first round of price talks, officially kicking off a lengthy negotiation process that will end in August 2024. The reduced prices for those initial medications won’t go into effect until January 2026.
That includes blood thinners from Bristol-Myers Squibb
and J&J, and diabetes drugs from Merck
and AstraZeneca
. It also includes a blood cancer drug from AbbVie
, one of the companies represented by the Chamber of Commerce. "
Michael Wayland,Ford CEO says UAW is ‘holding the deal hostage’ over EV battery plants,"In this article
DETROIT — The United Auto Workers union is holding up negotiations with Ford Motor
over future electric vehicle battery plants, Ford CEO Jim Farley said during a press briefing Friday.
“I believe we could have reached a compromise on pay and benefits, but so far the UAW is holding the deal hostage over battery plants,” he said after the UAW announced it would expand strikes to two additional assembly plants — one each for Ford and General Motors.
Farley criticized the union for its targeted strike strategy, saying he feels the actions were “premeditated” and insinuating the union was never interested in reaching a deal before a Sept. 14 deadline.
“We have felt from the very beginning, between all the lines of our comments, that the original strike was premeditated and that everything is taking way too long,” he said. “That actual events are predetermined before they happen. It’s been very frustrating.”
Farley’s public criticism of the union is uncharacteristic for Ford, which is historically viewed as the most union-friendly company of the Detroit automakers.
Farley said the company isn’t “at an impasse” with the union but warned that day “could come if this continues.”
GM CEO Mary Barra echoed much of Farley’s criticisms of Fain and the UAW’s strike strategy.
“It’s clear that there is no real intent to get to an agreement,” she said in an emailed statement Friday night. “It is clear Shawn Fain wants to make history for himself, but it can’t be to the detriment of our represented team members and the industry.”
UAW President Shawn Fain fired back at Farley, saying the CEO hasn’t been present at the bargaining table and that he’s “lying about the state of negotiations.”
“It could be because he failed to show up for bargaining this week, as he has for most of the past ten weeks. If he were there, he’d know we gave Ford a comprehensive proposal on Monday and still haven’t heard back,” Fain said in a statement Friday afternoon. “He would also know that we are far apart on core economic proposals like retirement security and post-retirement healthcare, as well as job security in this EV transition, which Farley himself says is going to cut 40 percent of our members’ jobs.”
Multibillion-dollar EV battery plants — and their thousands of expected workers — are crucial to the automotive industry’s future and uniquely positioned to have wide-ranging implications for the UAW, automakers and President Joe Biden’s push toward domestic manufacturing.
Current and former union leaders previously told CNBC that the battery plants will have to be a priority for the labor organization, regardless of whether they’re directly discussed in the national agreement, for the long-term viability of the union.
However, they’re considered a “wild card” issue in the contract negotiations. Many of the battery plants that have been announced cannot legally be included in the current talks, as they are joint venture facilities.
Ford has announced four future battery plants, including three joint ventures and a wholly owned subsidiary using battery technology licensed from Chinese auto supplier CATL. Ford earlier this week paused construction on the latter plant in Marshall, Michigan, due to the union negotiations, Farley said.
“We can make Marshall a lot bigger or a lot smaller,” Farley said Friday.
GM is the only Detroit automaker with a joint venture battery plant in operation and unionized — making it the first in the country to face this particular negotiating dynamic and a landmark plant to set standards for the industry.
Farley noted that some of the battery production won’t even be covered under the timeline of the deals that are currently being negotiated. He also defended the company’s prior offers, which include more than 20% hourly wage growth, reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments, job protections and other benefits.
“If the UAW’s goal is a record contract, they have already achieved this,” Farley said. “It is grossly irresponsible to escalate these strikes and hurt thousands of families.”"
Drew Richardson,"Blue Apron to be acquired by Wonder Group, capping tumultuous post-IPO ride","In this article
Meal kit business Blue Apron
announced Friday it has agreed to sell itself to food and restaurant company Wonder Group, founded by entrepreneur Marc Lore, for $103 million.
The deal, at $13 per share, represents a significant premium from Blue Apron’s per-share price at Thursday’s close of $5.49.
The sale caps years of ups and downs for Blue Apron, once a leader in at-home meal deliveries. In recent months, the company has transitioned to become a more asset-light business, selling its operational infrastructure to California-based meal provider FreshRealm for $50 million and laying off significant swaths of its workforce.
“The Blue Apron brand and products that our customers know and love will stay the same, with more opportunity for product expansion in the future,” Blue Apron CEO Linda Findley said in a statement Friday.
Blue Apron has long been mired in strategic difficulties since its mid-2010s heyday.
The company was founded in 2012, billing itself as an easier way to prepare home-cooked meals. Boxes arrived at the customer’s doorstep with pre-portioned ingredients and recipes to create their chosen dishes. The company specifically targeted working professionals in large cities who may have less time to grocery shop and cook.
In 2015, the company secured $135 million in funding from big name backers including Fidelity Investments at a valuation of $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The company even turned a profit in the first two quarters of 2016, wowing potential investors ahead of an eventual IPO.
Blue Apron went public in June 2017 at $10 a share and a valuation of about $1.89 billion. The company initially forecasted a range of $15 to $17 per share, but lowered its projected per-share price following Amazon’s
acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced just weeks before the IPO.
Blue Apron stock gained little ground on its opening day.
By then, the tide had already begun to turn for the meal kit business. Blue Apron reported a loss of $52 million in the first quarter of 2017 on $245 million in revenue. That single quarter of losses rivaled the company’s full-year deficit from 2016 of $54.9 million.
Competition intensified for Blue Apron, as other meal kit businesses popped up on the scene like HelloFresh and Home Chef. Blue Apron still dominated 40.3% of the market, Verge reported at the time, but had lost 17% of its share since September 2016. HelloFresh trailed behind at 28% market share.
Shortly after the IPO, a number of shakeups took place within the company’s top executives. Co-founder and then-Chief Operating Officer Matthew Wadiak stepped down from his post less than a month after the IPO, and CEO Matt Salzberg was replaced by chief financial officer Brad Dickerson later that year, while Salzberg became executive chairman.
By the end of 2017, the situation looked bleak: The company said in its 2017 year-end report that it had lost 15% of its customer base year over year, citing decreased marketing spend. Net losses in 2017 amounted to $210 million.
By December of the following year, shares of Blue Apron had dipped below $1 per share, and the company was at risk of getting delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Investors were reportedly spooked by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, high marketing expenses, and fulfillment center issues.
In early 2020, reports surfaced that Blue Apron was considering going private.
Soon after, the company announced the closure of its Arlington, Texas, facility and the furlough of 240 employees as part of an effort to build “operational optimization and fiscal discipline to support our strategy and return to growth.”
CEO Linda Findley acknowledged during the company’s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call that the board was evaluating several strategic options to “maximize shareholder value.” Shares of Blue Apron traded for less than $4 apiece at the time, even after a reverse stock split to boost the per-share price.
But shortly thereafter, the Covid pandemic took hold and lockdowns kept people at home, breathing new life into the company. Blue Apron shares rallied from mid-March to mid-April 2020, jumping 400%.
But as the pandemic waned and demand for at-home meals slumped, Blue Apron sought out third-party partnerships to capture new customers. It began offering its meal kits on Walmart
.com and opened up its preexisting Amazon
partnership to include those without a Prime subscription
.
Even so, the company continued to struggle, reporting a net loss of $109.7 million for 2022.
Enter, Wonder Group.
The company began making waves in May 2021, operating a fleet of faceless vans in Westfield, New Jersey. Wonder’s goal was to deliver fine dining options to residents of the New York City suburb. Vans were retrofitted as kitchens to cook and deliver the food to the customer.
The company partnered with restaurants to recreate their menu in an effort to save affluent suburbanites from having to go into the city to eat their favorite fine dining options.
By 2023, Wonder had abandoned the food truck concept, instead opting for a food hall restaurant concept that offers several menus within the same store. Similar to the food truck concept, Wonder has licensing deals with other well-known restaurants to prepare their foods in Wonder locations.
Last year, Wonder raised $350 million at a $3.5 billion valuation, according to the Wall Street Journal.
For now, Wonder has indicated that Blue Apron will operate more or less the same.
“Wonder plans to continue Blue Apron’s current operations serving customers nationwide under the Blue Apron brand, with expected new synergies between consumer-facing apps and delivery logistics,” Blue Apron said Friday.
“At home meals play a key role in this vision,” Wonder CEO Marc Lore said on Friday. “When the opportunity presented itself to unite with Blue Apron, pioneers in the meal kit industry, we knew it would accelerate our strategic position.”"
Leslie Josephs,United Airlines pilots approve new contract with up to 40% raises,"In this article
United Airlines
pilots approved a new contract with compensation increases of as much as 40.2% over the four-year contract, making the carrier the last of the three largest U.S. airlines to seal a deal with its aviators during an industry shortage.
The deal is worth about $10 billion, according to the Air Line Pilots Association, the pilots’ union. ALPA said on Friday that the new contract won 82% approval from the more than 97% of United pilots that voted on it.
Delta Air Lines
and American Airlines
pilots approved new contracts earlier this year, also with big raises. The Covid-19 pandemic derailed negotiations across airlines but pilot and other labor unions in the industry have been pushing hard for increased compensation and better work rules since travel demand bounced back and inflation surged.
Other unions are also pushing for improved pay and benefits, calling for strikes or potential strikes when negotiations fall short of demands. The United Auto Workers union is planning on expanding strikes against General Motors and Ford Motor to two U.S. assembly plants on Friday, UAW President Shawn Fain said.
Earlier this week, Hollywood writers and studios finalized the language of a deal that ended a nearly 150-day labor strike."
Michael Wayland,"UAW announces new strikes at GM and Ford plants, spares Stellantis","In this article
DETROIT – The United Auto Workers union will expand strikes against General Motors
and Ford Motor
to two U.S. assembly plants at noon ET, UAW President Shawn Fain said Friday.
The additional strikes will target Ford’s Chicago Assembly Plant in Illinois, which produces the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs, and GM’s Lansing Delta Township plant in mid-Michigan that produces the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse crossovers.
The plants are important ones for the companies, however not as profitable or crucial as facilities that produce the automakers’ pickup trucks.
Fain said Chrysler parent Stellantis
was spared from additional strikes because of recent progress in negotiations with that company.
“Moments before this broadcast, Stellantis made significant progress on the 2009 cost-of-living allowance, the right not to cross a picket line, as well as the right to strike over product commitments and plant closures and outsourcing moratoriums,” said Fain, who was delayed nearly 30 minutes in making the online announcement. “We are excited about this momentum at Stellantis and hope it continues.”
About 6,900 autoworkers will take part in the latest wave of work stoppages, joining roughly 18,300 workers who are currently on strike for the union. That means about 25,200 employees, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, will be on strike as of noon.
“To restore the balance of power, we have to restore the strike,” Fain said Friday, citing several other UAW strikes aside from the Detroit automakers.
GM in a statement Friday said it had yet to receive a “comprehensive counteroffer” from union leadership to a contract proposal made last week.
“Calling more strikes is just for the headlines, not real progress. The number of people negatively impacted by these strikes is growing and includes our customers who buy and love the products we build,” Gerald Johnson, GM’s head of global manufacturing, said in the statement. “We’re here to reach an agreement so we can all get back to work, and that remains our 100% focus.”
Stellantis, in a statement, said while negotiators have made progress, “gaps remain.” The company said it is “committed to continue working through these issues in an expeditious manner to reach a fair and responsible agreement that gets everyone back to work as soon as possible.”
Ford CEO Jim Farley said mid-Friday afternoon the UAW is “holding the deal hostage over battery plants,” calling the additional strike “grossly irresponsible.” He also criticized the union for its targeted strike strategy, saying he feels the actions were “premediated” and insinuating the union was never interested in reaching a deal before a Sept. 14 deadline.
Fain fired back at Farley, saying the CEO hasn’t been present at the bargaining table and that he’s “lying about the state of negotiations.”
The additional strikes come one week after a similar strike expansion. The UAW originally initiated work stoppages on Sept. 15 at three assembly plants — one each for the Detroit automakers. Last week, the union targeted a further 38 parts and distribution locations operated by GM and Stellantis. At that time, the UAW spared Ford from expanded strikes, citing progress in those negotiations.
Fain previously said the union would increase the work stoppages, based on progress in the contract negotiations. The talks have spurred frustrations and accusations from both sides of the bargaining table.
Before the Friday announcement, GM and Stellantis in particular had grown increasingly frustrated by a lack of participation from Fain and what they said were delays in receiving counterproposals from the union, people familiar with the negotiations told CNBC.
Unlike past strikes, UAW leaders opted for targeted strikes at select plants instead of initiating national walkouts. It’s calling the work stoppages “stand-up strikes,” a nod to historic “sit-down” strikes by the UAW in the 1930s.
The strategy is in an effort to keep the automakers on edge in an effort to pit them against one another to achieve better contracts, according to private messages leaked last week involving the UAW’s communications director.
The messages, which described a strategy to cause “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” for the companies, were heavily criticized by the automakers."
Leslie Josephs,"JetBlue raises flight attendant pay, union agrees to support merger with Spirit","In this article
JetBlue Airways
said it will raise flight attendant pay next year and provide other bonuses to staff while the union representing cabin crews agreed to support the carrier’s plan to acquire budget carrier Spirit Airlines
.
Starting in November, flight attendants will get 5% raises. Including another 2% raise, a slate of other incentives and previously negotiated raises under flight attendants’ union contract, their raises in 2026 will compound to 21.5% increases, according to a company memo, which was seen by CNBC Friday.
The raises come as the New York-based carrier is in the process of trying to acquire Spirit, a merger the Justice Department has sued to block. A trial for that lawsuit is set to begin on Oct. 16 in Boston.
JetBlue agreed not to furlough or displace any flight attendants or close any associated bases for seven years after a potential acquisition of Spirit goes through, the memo said.
“The current contract was negotiated during COVID, and since then our inflight crewmembers pay rates have fallen below other airlines by a significant margin,” a JetBlue spokesman said in a statement. “Because our inflight crewmembers play a significant role in delivering the JetBlue experience, it’s important that we’re able to attract and retain high-quality crewmembers with competitive pay and benefits.”
The union said it would, in turn, support the planned acquisition of Spirit.
“With this agreement made by your TWU Local 579 Executive Board and JetBlue, we support the JetBlue and Spirit transaction and will not hold an additional informational picket or speak publicly against the acquisition,” the union said in a note to members.
JetBlue also agreed to additional pay for staff that fly the carrier’s trans-Atlantic routes and in its Mint business-class cabin, as well as other incentives, according to a letter of agreement with the Transport Workers Union, which represents JetBlue’s 7,000 flight attendants."
Annika Kim Constantino,Shares of Structure Therapeutics surge on promising obesity pill data,"In this article
Shares of Structure Therapeutics
rose more than 30% on Friday after the biotech startup’s experimental obesity pill succeeded in a small early-stage trial. 
The once-daily drug helped overweight or obese participants reduce up to 10 pounds of weight on average after four weeks of treatment, according to a release from the company. Structure said it plans to test its pill in two longer midstage trials as a treatment for diabetes and obesity.
Structure’s pill is part of the same class of drugs as Novo Nordisk
’s blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and weight loss counterpart Wegovy. 
Those treatments, known as GLP-1s, have soared in popularity this year due to their ability to help patients lose unwanted pounds. GLP-1s mimic a hormone produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite. 
Companies like Structure are trying to capitalize on the booming obesity drug industry, which analysts say could be a $100 billion global market by the end of the decade. 
Structure’s pill could potentially compete with oral obesity drugs from Eli Lilly
, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer
, which are not approved in the U.S. yet. Analysts say the arrival of cheaper, more convenient pill versions of the GLP-1s could increase access for patients and expand the market for obesity drugs.
Pills are easier to manufacture than injections, making them less likely to run into the supply shortages plaguing injectable drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro. Pills are also typically cheaper than injections, though it’s unclear if that will be the case with the obesity treatments. 
Wegovy’s list price tops $1,300 per monthly package, and Ozempic’s is about $935. Novo Nordisk has a diabetes pill called Rybelsus, which has the same list price as Ozempic for a monthly package of 30 tablets."
