Sarah Whitten,Netflix is set to report earnings – here’s what Wall Street expects,"In this article
LOS ANGELES — Netflix
is due to report third-quarter earnings after the closing bell Wednesday.
The streaming company is still navigating its transformation from focusing on subscriber growth to focusing on profit, using price hikes, password crackdowns and ad-supported tiers to boost revenue.
Further complicating matters are production delays resulting from a nearly 150-day writers strike that wrapped up in September and an ongoing actors strike that threatens to prevent and postpone production through the new year.
Investors will be looking to hear from the company’s executives about how Netflix will grapple with these headwinds and for a status report on its ad tier.
Here’s what Wall Street expects: 
Netflix in the last week has seen a series of slashed price targets and revised forecasts from Wall Street analysts, most of whom are awaiting further clarity on the company’s growth strategy.
Company executives previously warned investors that its ad tier is still in its infancy and shareholders shouldn’t expect it to have a major impact on revenue until at least the end of the year.
Additionally, they have signaled that operating margins will grow more gradually going forward as it invests in more growth opportunities.
It’s been less than six months since Netflix instituted its password crackdown, so it’s unclear what impact that initiative has had for the company and how much executives will share."
Diana Olick,Mortgage demand falls to the lowest level since 1995 as interest rates near 8%,"Mortgage rates last week rose for the sixth straight week, causing demand for home loans to drop to the lowest level since 1995.
Total application volume fell 6.9% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.70% from 7.67% and points decreased to 0.71 from 0.75 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the highest rate since November 2000. The rate was 6.94% during the same week one year ago.
Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 6% week to week and were 21% lower than the same week one year ago.
Applications to refinance a home loan fell 10% for the week and were 12% lower than a year ago.
“Both purchase and refinance applications declined, driven by larger drops for conventional applications,” said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. He added that the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) share was 9.3%, the highest share in 11 months.
ARMs offer lower rates and can be fixed for up to 10 years before the rate resets. More borrowers are turning to these loan products to gain purchasing power, as both interest rates and home prices are rising.
Mortgage rates moved even higher to start this week, with the 30-year fixed hitting 7.92% on Tuesday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is a cyclical high. The increase was due to a much stronger-than-expected monthly retail sales report.

Hugh Son,Morgan Stanley shares fall 8% as wealth management results disappoint,"In this article
Morgan Stanley
posted third-quarter results Wednesday that topped profit estimates on better-than-expected trading revenue.
Here’s what the company reported:
Profit fell 9% to $2.41 billion, or $1.38 a share, from a year ago, the New York-based bank said in a statement. Revenue grew 2% to $13.27 billion, essentially matching expectations.
The bank’s shares fell 8%.
Morgan Stanley’s trading operations helped offset revenue misses elsewhere at the firm. The bank’s bond traders produced $1.95 billion in revenue, roughly $200 million more than the StreetAccount estimate, while equity traders brought in $2.51 billion in revenue, $100 million more than expected.
But the bank’s all-important wealth management division generated $6.4 billion in revenue, below the estimate by more than $200 million, as compensation costs in the division rose. Net interest income sank 9% from the second quarter and will fall again in the fourth quarter, the bank’s CFO warned.
Investment banking accounted for another miss in the quarter, producing $938 million in revenue, below the $1.11 billion estimate, as the company cited weakness in mergers and IPO listings. The bank’s investment management division essentially met expectations with $1.34 billion in revenue.
CEO James Gorman cited a “mixed” environment for his businesses and acknowledged that the firm’s wealth management division gathered fewer new assets than in recent quarters. That’s because surging interest rates have made money market funds and Treasuries attractive, he told analysts Wednesday. The wealth management business was still tracking to hit his three-year goal of generating $1 trillion in new assets, he added.
“When people have a choice of making a 4%, 5% return by doing nothing, they’re not going to be trading in the markets,” Gorman said.
Led by Gorman since 2010, Morgan Stanley has managed to avoid the turbulence afflicting some rivals lately. While Goldman Sachs
was forced to pivot after a foray into retail banking and as Citigroup
struggles to lift its stock price, the main question at Morgan Stanley is about an orderly CEO succession.
In May, Gorman announced his plan to resign within a year, capping a successful tenure marked by massive acquisitions in wealth and asset management. Morgan Stanley’s board has narrowed the search for his successor to three internal executives, he said at the time.
Gorman reiterated his desire to hand over the CEO position to a successor within months.
“This firm is in excellent shape notwithstanding the geopolitical and market turmoil that we find ourselves in,” Gorman said. “My hope and expectation is to hand over Morgan Stanley with as clean a slate as possible and deal with a few of our outstanding issues in the next couple of months.”
Last week, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each topped expectations for third-quarter profit, helped by low credit costs. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also beat estimates on stronger-than-expected bond trading results.

Robert Hum,Want to see what weak discretionary spending looks like? See Winnebago’s results,"In this article
Winnebago
closed out its fiscal year with a solid fourth quarter earnings beat. Adjusted per-share profit of $1.59 easily topped Wall Street expectations thanks to the recreational-vehicle maker’s ability to efficiently manage costs, production and inventories in the quarter.
But that masked a big problem for the company – weaker discretionary spending. It’s a challenge across several sectors, from blue jeans to pizza delivery, as high inflation saps consumers.
The company on Wednesday also posted revenue of $771 million, a nearly 35% decline from a year ago. It fell short of Wall Street’s expected $784 million, as sales in its motorhome RV division significantly missed consensus views ($318 million vs. $355 million expected, according to StreetAccount).
Winnebago blamed “lower unit sales related to current market conditions and dealer efforts to reduce inventories, and higher discounts and allowances.” Unit deliveries of motorhome RVs plunged 52% year-over year.
Price increases weren’t nearly enough to overcome the weak demand.
CEO Michael Happe said “the consumer market continues to be challenged, and our fourth quarter results reflect a stubborn retail environment.”
While the company didn’t give financial guidance, Happe said he expects those trends to continue into the first half of the new fiscal year. By the second half of the fiscal year, though, Happe is optimistic that inventories will normalize and consumer demand will stabilize.
Winnebago’s stock, which was down 3% Wednesday, had fallen about 13% over the last three months, far underperforming the broader market. Rival Thor Industries
had also fallen about 17% in that same timespan – a reflection of the challenging demand conditions across the industry."
Melissa Repko,Walmart beefs up third-party marketplace as it challenges online rival Amazon,"In this article
It was summer in Las Vegas — the temperature hit nearly 110 degrees that late August day — but Christmas was on everyone’s minds.
While Santa Claus wandered around during an invitation-only conference, businesses that sell items on Walmart’s website attended how-to sessions and swapped advice. Walmart leaders gave third-party marketplace sellers an early gift, too: Waiving extra fees for storing merchandise during the peak season.
Doug McMillon, who leads the world’s largest retailer, took the stage and made a sales pitch to the smaller businesses and brands.
“We hope you’ll choose to grow with us,” the CEO told the more than 1,500 attendees, invoking the memory of company founder Sam Walton, who was at one time a small-town entrepreneur. “We want you to bring great items to our marketplace. Our team is here to serve you.”
As Walmart heads into the retail industry’s most important season, the company is trying to recruit and retain hundreds of thousands of independent sellers that fill the company’s virtual shelves with items ranging from lip gloss to Rolex watches. It is also working to coax those sellers into paying Walmart to pack and ship — and even advertise — their products. It is leaning into a moment when inflation has pushed more high-income shoppers to its stores and website.
This holiday season will put Walmart’s e-commerce strategy to the test. Already, the company is using the third-party marketplace to try to drum up early business.
More than half the items included in Walmart’s sales event last week, which kicked off the season, were from its third-party marketplace. The event coincided with Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days event, but there were no comparisons available.
About 70% of items included in Walmart Plus Week, which coincided with Amazon Prime Day in July, were marketplace items. Walmart wouldn’t share comparisons with sales events in prior years, but said more sellers are participating in the events overall.
There are signs Walmart’s growing third-party marketplace could help the company defy slower spending patterns and capitalize on inflation-wary shoppers.
Online sales for Walmart U.S. rose sharply the past two fiscal quarters, even as other major retailers such as Macy’s
and Target
reported declines. As shoppers at many stores, including Walmart’s own, skipped over discretionary purchases, Walmart’s third-party marketplace saw sales in some discretionary categories such as home and apparel rise by double digits in the most recent fiscal quarter.
Tom Ward, chief e-commerce officer for Walmart U.S., said the company’s app and website have a fresh look, its fulfillment centers and stores have automation that’s helping power more late-night and last-minute deliveries and its growing marketplace has helped create an “endless aisle” of electronics, toys and groceries to give customers a reason to return.
“Customers want choice,” he said. “They want that selection. They want that variety. And as they visit us more and more often, they expect to see it.”
When it comes to e-commerce, Walmart is in a rare spot: the underdog. Its online sales are just a tiny fraction of what Amazon
rings up — and that carries over to the companies’ third-party marketplaces, too.
Customers who shop on Amazon and Walmart’s website see a mix of items. Some items are sold directly by the retailers and others are sold by sellers that own the inventory, list items on other retailers’ websites and share a cut of the profits with those retailers.
Amazon has more than one million active sellers, and Walmart has roughly 100,000, according to Marketplace Pulse, a third-party firm that collects data on e-commerce marketplaces including Amazon, eBay
and Etsy
. Amazon and Walmart do not disclose how many active sellers they have.
For Walmart, closing that large gap is an uphill climb, and also an opportunity, said Rick Watson, CEO of RMW Commerce Consulting, an e-commerce consulting firm with clients that cut across categories such as furniture, fashion and food and beverage categories.
“Amazon has never been known as the most seller-friendly place to do business,” he said. “Something I’ve seen recently is a lot of sellers actually cheering for Walmart because they want an alternative.”
Tension between Amazon and some of its sellers is at the heart of an antitrust lawsuit filed in late September by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon. The suit accuses the e-commerce behemoth of anticompetitive practices, such as punishing sellers for offering cheaper prices on other websites and strong-arming them into using its fulfillment services.
Amazon denied the allegations in a blog post, saying the company has helped, not harmed, customers, and contributed to lower prices and speedier services.
Watson said sellers can struggle to get someone on the phone on Amazon. At Walmart, on the other hand, he said sellers tend to get more “red carpet treatment.”
But first, Walmart often has to persuade successful sellers on Amazon to take a chance on the relative newcomer, such as companies like Lucky 21.
About a year and a half ago, the apparel retailer that represents national brands such as Disney, New Balance and Reebok tested sales of some items on Walmart’s marketplace.
Melissa LaCognata, vice president and divisional merchandise manager for Lucky 21, said the company knew Walmart was years behind Amazon. Yet, she said it heard about Walmart’s investments in marketplace and knew Walmart already had a large brick-and-mortar customer base and sizable online traffic.
“It’s like being in the second-best mall in the world,” she said. “Why not?”
Last year, Lucky 21 became the largest third-party seller of children’s apparel on Walmart’s website.
But Walmart has had to play a major game of catch-up, such as simplifying the on-boarding process to make it easier for new marketplace sellers to join and launching membership program, Walmart+, to drive more online sales. Three years ago, it launched Walmart Fulfillment Services, which allows sellers to pay the retailer to store inventory and pack and ship orders. Amazon began offering a similar picking-and-packing service in 2006.
This summer, Walmart announced another wave of features to better compete with Amazon. It has begun to offer fulfillment for sellers’ big and bulky items as well as merchandise that comes in multiple boxes, such as canoes or patio sets. It also debuted tools to support sellers’ businesses, such as allowing them to hire Walmart to make local deliveries of cakes or other online orders or pay Walmart for software to power curbside pickup at shops.
Walmart is looking to its more than 4,600 stores across the country as another way to outmatch Amazon.
The stores act as mini warehouses, with more than 50% of online orders fulfilled from its stores as of the end of its most recent quarter, which ended in late July. About 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, proximity that makes it possible for Walmart to sometimes to get a package to customers’ doors faster than Amazon.
So far, Walmart does not carry third-party marketplace items in its stores, which means customers can’t get those online orders through curbside pickup or ultra-speedy delivery to their homes.
Yet, Jaré Buckley-Cox, vice president of Walmart Fulfillment Services and an Amazon veteran, said that is coming within the next five years and described it as “a high priority.”
Some customers have gotten a glimpse of how that might look. One of Walmart’s popular marketplace items has become tires, which shoppers can ship to select stores and get installed at Walmart’s auto center.
As inflation weighs on Americans’ budgets, Walmart’s marketplace could help the retailer crack one of its longtime challenges: convincing shoppers to buy more high-margin items such as a sweater or purse, along with a box of cereal or loaf of bread.
Walmart has tried and backed away from other strategies to do that. It previously went on an acquisition spree of direct-to-consumer brands with a fan following including Bonobos, Moosejaw and Eloquii after buying Jet.com in a $3.3 billion deal. It has since reversed course and sold off those companies, as it focuses on turning its online business profitable.
Over the past year, Walmart, the country’s largest grocer, has reported market share gains for groceries coming from households that make more than $100,000 a year.
That may be helping to lift the use of Walmart’s app. According to estimates by third-party firm Apptopia, which analyzes trends with mobile apps and connected devices, Walmart’s shopping app has now surpassed Amazon’s in terms of daily use.
The third-party marketplace is another approach: a way to add items without the risk of buying pallets of inventory and wondering if it will sell — or get marked down.
Walmart can monitor and quickly add popular or relevant products, said Michael Mosser, vice president of categories for Walmart’s U.S. marketplace. For example, he said, sellers helped Walmart bulk up on more hot pink and Barbie-themed items. They also can help in unexpected scenarios, such as when smoke from the Canadian wildfires caused East Coast residents to search for air filtration systems, he said.
“We’re not buying products a year out or three quarters of a year out,” Mosser said. “If we see something trending in social media or we see something trending as a cultural moment, we can reach out to our community of sellers and be like, ’Hey, we’re seeing this thing spiking. What do you have for available inventory?”
Some items Walmart has tested and expanded on its website through marketplace are premium brands that Americans may not expect to find on Walmart’s website, such as Michael Kors, Dyson and Solo Stove.
Solo Stove’s fire pits start at about $100 on Walmart.com, but range as high as $1,155 for a set that includes a fire pit, lid, shield and collection of portable camping accessories.
John Merris, CEO of Solo Brands
, said Solo Stove already had traction on Amazon and questioned whether Walmart would draw the kinds of customers willing to spring for a more expensive, discretionary item.
“You wonder not only is it not your customer, but more importantly, does it cheapen your brand?” he said. “Is there a perception with consumers that if your product is found in Walmart that somehow means that you have a lower quality product?”
He said Solo Stove’s perspective changed. It began to sell the smokeless fire pits on Walmart’s website early last year. It got a bump in business during Walmart’s competing sales event during Amazon’s Prime Day in July. Solo Stove’s sales are up 300% on Walmart’s marketplace as of this fall, compared with the year-ago period.
Soon, the fire pits will hit Walmart’s store shelves. Merris got surprised with a purchase order at the company’s seller summit in late August. He joked that he has high hopes for store sales, especially since they’ll be a few aisles away from ingredients for s’mores.
If Walmart uses stores to speed along deliveries and adds more brands across price points that customers love, Merris said the discounter “could be very dangerous for a marketplace like Amazon in the future.”

Amelia Lucas,"Procter & Gamble tops earnings, revenue estimates even as volume falls again","In this article
Procter & Gamble
on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations, despite volume falling for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Shares of the company rose more than 2% in early trading.
Here’s what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
P&G reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $4.52 billion, or $1.83 per share, up from $3.94 billion, or $1.57 per share, a year earlier.
Net sales rose 6% to $21.87 billion. The company’s organic revenue increased 7% in the quarter, helped by higher prices for P&G’s products.
But the company’s volume shrank 1%. The metric excludes the impact of currency and pricing changes to reflect demand.
For roughly two years, P&G has been raising prices on its products like Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper.
“For obvious reasons we don’t comment on the future direction of pricing, but I will tell you that we’re happy with where we sit currently,” CEO Jon Moeller said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”
P&G hasn’t gotten any pushback from retailers about its higher prices, beyond “normal discussions” about maximizing customer value, CFO Andre Schulten told analysts on the company’s conference call.
But some consumers aren’t happy with P&G’s higher prices. Some shoppers have switched to cheaper private-label alternatives as a result, and P&G said it saw “pricing-related volume declines” across many of its brands. However, its volume declines have narrowed in recent quarters, and the company expects to report volume growth for the fiscal year.
The company’s baby, feminine and family care segment reported its volume fell 3%. The division includes brands like Pampers and Bounty.
P&G’s grooming segment, which includes Venus and Gillette products, reported a 2% drop in volume.
The company’s fabric and home-care business saw its volume shrink 1%, even as customers bought more of its premium cleaning products, which include Swiffer and Cascade.
P&G’s health-care division was the only segment to report volume growth for the quarter. The company said it saw strong demand for respiratory products, like those made by Vicks.
The company also widened its outlook for fiscal 2024 revenue as it anticipates that foreign exchange rates could be a larger drag than previously expected. The company now projects revenue growth of 2% to 4%, rather than its prior forecast of 3% to 4%.
P&G reiterated its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth, which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, and for earnings per share growth. But Schulten warned about economic conditions that could weaken performance, like rising energy costs heading into the winter, lower household savings rates and the health of the Chinese market.

Leslie Josephs,"United Airlines tumbles 8% after warning pricier fuel, Middle East war will cut profits","In this article
United Airlines
on Tuesday said more expensive jet fuel and a halt to the carrier’s Tel Aviv flights during the Israel-Hamas war will eat into its profits in the last three months of the year.
The airline’s shares were down 8% in mid-morning trading.
For the current quarter, the Chicago-based carrier estimated adjusted earnings of between $1.50 and $1.80 a share, below analysts’ forecasts of $2.06.
United would then earn between $9.55 and $9.85 a share, on an adjusted basis, down from its forecast in July of between $11 and $12 a share, based on its projection for the fourth quarter. Jet fuel prices in major U.S. airports are up nearly 25% since the start of summer.
The fourth-quarter guidance “is bleak and worse than our estimates,” wrote Helane Becker, an airline analyst at TD Cowen, in a note on Wednesday. “Given the projections that this will be a long war we are looking at the lower end of the forecast range and assuming no service by year end.”
United and other U.S. and international carriers halted their flights to Israel earlier this month. United had more service to Israel than any of the U.S.-based airlines with service from Washington, D.C.; Newark, New Jersey; and San Francisco, accounting for 2% of its capacity.
United said its fourth-quarter revenue will rise year over year between 9%, if Israel flights remain suspended through the end of the year, and 10.5% if the suspension lasts only through October. Its costs, excluding fuel, will likely rise between 3.5% and 5% in the fourth quarter from 2022, United said.
Speaking to CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday, CEO Scott Kirby attributed the increase to “much higher labor costs than anyone anticipated at the start of the year,” delayed aircraft from manufacturers and air traffic controller shortages.
The Israel service suspension comes after a robust summer for air travel with revenue growth for international destinations outpacing sales of domestic tickets. That has put big, global carriers such as United and Delta
on better footing than some discount airlines such as Spirit
, which focus more on U.S. cities and expect losses.
Here’s what United reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
United posted third-quarter net income of $1.14 billion, or $3.42 a share, versus $942 million, or $2.86 a share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, United posted earnings per share of $3.65.
Revenue rose to $14.48 billion from $12.88 billion.
The carrier will hold a call with analysts and media on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET, when it will face questions on fourth-quarter demand and how the carrier plans to tamp down rising costs."
Contessa Brewer,Thousands of casino workers go on strike in Detroit,"In this article
Auto workers aren’t the only ones on strike in Detroit. Thousands of casino workers, seeking higher wages and better working conditions, walked off the job in the city Tuesday. Casino workers are seeking higher wages and better working conditions as the cost of living has increased in recent years.

The work stoppage targets operations at the MGM Grand Detroit, owned by MGM Resorts International
; MotorCity Casino; and Hollywood Casino at Greektown, owned by Penn Entertainment
.
Striking employees include 3,700 workers employed in positions across the properties, including dealers, cleaning staff, food and beverage workers, valets, engineers and more. They are represented by the Detroit Casino Council, which is made up of five unions including the United Auto Workers.
The effect was immediately clear. MotorCity Casino updated its website showing that high-limit table games and poker rooms as well as casino valet were closed, in addition to its spa and some restaurants and bars.
FanDuel, which operates the FD Sportsbook in conjunction with MotorCity, told CNBC it will be closed with the exception of a non-union MCC employee managing the cash at the counter for patrons needing to cash in tickets, which keeps with Michigan regulatory requirements.
The Hollywood Casino at Greektown said in a statement to CNBC, “We are disappointed by the decision of the Detroit Casino Council as we have made generous, progressive settlement offers that position our team members and business for sustainable success.” The management says it will remain open for business.
Matt Buckley, president and COO of MGM’s Midwest Group, sent a letter to employees of MGM Grand Detroit that made clear the company also intends to keep the property open and running.
“Regarding the status of our negotiations, we’ve made six proposals to the union and our current offer includes the single largest pay increase in the history of MGM Grand Detroit. It is a significant proposal,” he wrote.
The Detroit Casino Council argues casino workers agreed to a three-year contract during the pressure-packed earlier days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The deal, which has now expired, included 3% wage increases even as the cost of living has surged 20% amid high inflation, according to the union.
“In contrast, industry gaming revenues have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels to reach a new record high,” the Detroit Casino Council wrote in a news release. “In 2022, the Detroit casino industry generated $2.27 billion in gaming revenue and is on track for another record-breaking year in 2023. The three Detroit casinos collectively reported $813 million more in total gaming revenues in 2022 than in 2019, but total wages paid to workers represented by the DCC were $34 million less when comparing those same years.”
But brick-and-mortar casinos saw revenues of $1.2 billion in 2022, about a $200 million decline from 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Detroit Casino Council revenue numbers include iGaming and online sports revenues. They are required by Michigan gaming regulators to partner with land-based casinos to get a license to operate.
The Detroit Casino Council estimates each day of a strike could put approximately $738,000 in city and state tax revenues and $3.4 million in casino operator revenues at risk.
MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainmen
t and Wynn Resorts
are also facing possible walkouts in Las Vegas. Nearly 40,000 members of the Culinary Union have authorized a strike, though it hasn’t yet been called. Negotiations are ongoing.
MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle told CNBC during a keynote presentation at the Global Gaming Expo last week that he and top leadership from the other casinos are involved in intense negotiations. But he said the unions in Las Vegas are influenced by other attention-grabbing strikes.
“It doesn’t help when UAW in Detroit is asking for 40%. I mean, that’s a top line that’s hard to ignore,” Hornbuckle said at the time. “That being said, I think what matters here locally is people’s ability, particularly on the front line to exist, to pay rent and to get to the next step in life. And so I think that’s what’s relevant.“

Michael Wayland,GM to delay all-electric truck production at Michigan plant until late 2025,"DETROIT – General Motors
said Tuesday it is delaying production of all-electric trucks at a Michigan plant by at least a year to “better manage capital investments” and implement improvements in an effort to make the new EVs more profitable.
GM now plans to begin construction of its next-generation EVs at Orion Assembly in suburban Detroit by late 2025, instead of next year. The factory currently produces Chevrolet Bolt EV models, which GM will cease producing at the end of this year.
The delay is the latest sign of potential trouble for the ambitious, multibillion-dollar plans of traditional automakers to move to electric vehicles. Adoption of EVs, which remain costly to produce and purchase, has been slower than many expected.
“General Motors today confirmed it will retime the conversion of its Orion Assembly plant to EV truck production to late 2025, to better manage capital investment while aligning with evolving EV demand. In addition, we have identified engineering improvements that we will implement to increase the profitability of our products,” the company said in a statement.
The change in plans is not connected to the company’s ongoing contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union, according to a GM spokesman. However, the contentious talks do involve EVs, and current contract proposals by the company are expected to be more expensive than those in year’s past. The UAW, which represents workers at Orion Assembly, did not immediately respond for comment.
The production delay calls into question GM’s previously announced EV goals, including cumulative production of 400,000 EVs in North American from 2022 through mid-2024, which had already been pushed back. GM also has a goal to exclusively offer consumer EVs by 2035.
A GM spokesman late-Tuesday said there’s currently no change in plans to the company’s EV production targets.
New electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra that were supposed to be produced at Orion Assembly will be assembled at GM’s Factory Zero in Detroit, the company said. Limited production of the Silverado EV is underway, while Sierra is scheduled to begin next year.
Alongside the Silverado EV, Factory Zero is currently building the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV and Cruise Origin shuttle.
In January 2022, GM announced it would invest $4 billion to convert Orion Assembly to produce electric trucks. The plant was expected to be its second U.S. assembly plant to exclusively produce EVs. GM said construction includes significant facility and capacity expansion at the site, including new body and paint shops and new general assembly and battery pack assembly areas. 
Roughly 1,000 hourly workers at Orion Assembly will have the option to transfer to other Michigan facilities until the retooling at Orion Assembly is completed.

Hugh Son,Goldman Sachs tops estimates on stronger-than-expected bond trading,"In this article
Goldman Sachs
posted third-quarter profit and revenue Tuesday that exceeded analysts’ estimates on stronger-than-expected trading revenue.
Shares of the bank fell more than 1%, and are down about 10% for the year.
Here’s what the company reported:
The bank said profit dropped 33% to $2.058 billion, or $5.47 a share, from a year earlier. Revenue also slipped 1% to $11.82 billion, though that topped expectations by roughly $600 million.
Bond trading revenue fell 6% from a year earlier to $3.38 billion, but that was almost $600 million more than what analysts had expected. Goldman cited strength in interest rate products and mortgages, which helped offset declines in trading of currencies, commodities and credit.
The firm’s efforts to boost lending activities in the trading division also helped as fixed income financing revenue reached a record $730 million.
Equities trading revenue climbed 8% from a year earlier to $2.96 billion on higher activity in derivatives, topping the estimate by roughly $200 million.
Investment banking revenue edged higher by 1% to $1.55 billion, slightly exceeding the $1.48 billion estimate.
Among its big bank peers, Goldman Sachs is the most reliant on investment banking and trading revenue.
While it’s made efforts under CEO David Solomon to diversify its revenue stream, first in an ill-fated retail banking push and later as it emphasized growth in asset and wealth management, it is Wall Street that powers the company. Last quarter, trading and advisory accounted for two-thirds of Goldman’s revenue.
That’s been a headwind this year as mergers, initial public offerings and debt issuance all have been muted as the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates to slow the economy down. With signs that activity has picked up lately, analysts will be eager to hear about Goldman’s pipeline of deals.
At the same time, Goldman has taken hits from two areas: Its strategic retrenchment away from retail banking has saddled the firm with losses as it finds buyers for unwanted operations, and its exposure to commercial real estate has resulted in write-downs as well.
The bank said Tuesday it posted a $506 million third-quarter write-down tied to lending business GreenSky, and $358 million in real estate impairments.
“We continue to make significant progress executing on our strategic priorities,” Solomon said in the release. “I also expect a continued recovery in both capital markets and strategic activity if conditions remain conducive. As the leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity will undoubtedly be a tailwind for Goldman Sachs.”
It was a “messy” quarter for Goldman, with elevated compensation costs and firmwide returns well below the mid-teens medium-term target, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said in a research note.
Analysts will be keen to hear more on Solomon’s view of the investment banking outlook, as well as how the remaining parts of its consumer effort — mainly, its Apple Card business — fit in the latest iteration of Goldman Sachs.

Drew Richardson,North Face owner VF Corp.’s shares jump after activist investor builds stake,"In this article
Activist investment firm Engaged Capital has taken a stake in VF Corporation
, owner of Vans and The North Face brands, and is pushing for cost cuts and changes to the board.
Shares of VF Corp. closed 14% higher Tuesday, settling at $18.45. The stock is down more than 33% so far this year. Engaged said shares of VF Corp. could jump to a share price of $46 within three years if proposed changes are implemented.
It is unclear exactly how much of a stake Engaged has taken in VF Corp.
Engaged said former VF Corp. CEO Steve Rendle, who abruptly left the company late last year, made a series of strategic errors during his tenure. Those, according to Engaged, include reduced autonomy among individual brands, underinvestment in Vans and the Supreme brand acquisition, which hurt the balance sheet. Rendle was appointed CEO in early 2017 and became chairman later that year.
“We believe VFC’s value destruction is directly attributable to Mr. Rendle’s failed strategy and the Board’s seeming unwillingness to intervene,” the firm said.
Engaged is pushing for several sweeping changes, namely an upward of $300 million in cost cuts through “elimination of duplicative costs and corporate excess.” It also wants the company to commit to holding off on acquisitions.
The firm is, however, supportive of current CEO Bracken Darrell, who took the position in July. “Mr. Darrell appears to have the transformation experience VFC urgently requires,” Engaged said.
VF Corp. said it is aware of Engaged’s comments and investment.
“VF has globally recognized and iconic brands and best-in-class talent. VF’s Board and leadership team, including our recently appointed CEO Bracken Darrell, are taking immediate and decisive actions to strengthen the company’s position and return VF to strong, sustainable, and profitable growth in the interests of all our shareholders,” the company said.

Lillian Rizzo,Starboard CEO makes case for spinning off real estate assets from News Corp.,"In this article
Activist investment firm Starboard Value is pushing for change at News Corporation
, in particular to see its real estate business separated from the rest of the company.
Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith told CNBC’s David Faber on Tuesday that the firm is building a position in News Corp. and has been in discussions with the company.
Smith said News Corp. should split out its real estate assets, including an interest in REA Group of Australia. News Corp. also owns the Dow Jones news business, which includes publications such as The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.
“Our belief is they’re going to want to … separate the digital real estate assets to be able to highlight this beautiful business for what it’s worth,” Smith said on CNBC on Tuesday.
A News Corp. spokesperson said Tuesday that the company has “always maintained an active and engaged dialogue with our investors and are committed to driving shareholder value.”
“We remain focused on executing our strategic plan, which has helped us set records in profitability over the past three years,” the spokesperson said. “We are proud of our rapid digital transformation and bright prospects for long-term growth and value creation.”
Reuters and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Starboard’s stake in News Corp. The size of the stake has yet to be learned. The Murdoch family trust controls about 40% of the voting rights of both News Corp. and Fox Corp., making change difficult at either company.
“It’s not great governance to have dual class,” Smith said Tuesday. “There have been votes to declassify, it’s something to consider as well. But there are easier paths to create a lot of value.”
On Tuesday, Smith called out the valuation discrepancies between the news and real estate businesses. He noted that News Corp.’s “crown jewel” news division trades at four-times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with competitor The New York Times, which trades at 15 times.
Meanwhile, News Corp.’s real estate assets trade at eight times, he said.
“It’s a great business, a great asset, it’s just too cheap,” Smith said of News Corp.’s stock price. News Corp. shares were slightly down Tuesday at $21.85.
He added Tuesday that he believes the split of the businesses hasn’t occurred already because the company was “a little insecure” about leaving the news division alone for a period of time.
Starboard’s push for change at the company comes shortly after Rupert Murdoch said he would step down as chair of the board at both News Corp. and Fox News owner Fox Corp
. Effective in November, Murdoch, 92, will become chair emeritus of each company while his son, Lachlan Murdoch, will become sole chair of News Corp. and continue as Fox Corp.’s executive chair and CEO.
Lachlan Murdoch made the initial investment in REA Group two decades ago, which Smith called an “amazing investment” on Tuesday.
More than a year ago, Rupert Murdoch had explored reuniting News Corp. and Fox Corp., a move that would have allowed leadership to be consolidated in the Murdoch media empire while also cutting costs. The businesses were split up in 2013.
The push to rejoin the businesses had come as the audience shrinks for both print media and cable TV — Fox Corp. owns cable TV networks including Fox News — as readers and viewers increasingly get their news and entertainment from online sources.
However, the proposed merger was called off in January. In a letter to the board, Murdoch said he was withdrawing the merger as he and his son “determined that a combination is not optimal for the shareholders” of either of the companies at the time.
Smith said Tuesday that there had not been discussions regarding another push for a proposed merger.

John Rosevear,Lucid shares fall after third-quarter EV deliveries disappoint,"In this article
Luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid Group said Tuesday that it delivered 1,457 of its Air sedans to customers in the third quarter, a number that is unlikely to reassure investors worried about demand for the posh and pricey electric vehicle.
Shares of the company fell on the news and ended Tuesday’s session down about 5%.
Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Lucid to deliver about 2,000 vehicles in the third quarter.
Lucid’s third-quarter deliveries compare with 1,404 deliveries in the second quarter and 1,398 deliveries in the third quarter of 2022.
The company said it produced 1,550 Airs during the period, with “over 700” additional vehicles in transit to a new facility in Saudi Arabia for final assembly. That compares to 2,173 Airs built in the second quarter and 2,282 Airs a year earlier.  
Saudi Arabia’s government, a major investor in Lucid, agreed last year to buy at least 50,000 Lucid EVs over the following 10 years, with an option to buy up to 50,000 more. Deliveries are expected to begin before the end of 2023.
Lucid’s shares have fallen nearly 23% from the beginning of 2023 through Monday’s close as concerns about ongoing demand for the Air have lingered. While the Air has received strong reviews and can claim the longest range of any EV currently available in the U.S., it’s expensive. The Air starts at $77,400 in its least-expensive Pure trim, a new single-motor version with 410 miles of range. At the high end, the 1,234-horsepower Sapphire version costs $249,000.
Lucid didn’t provide an update to its production guidance for the full year. The company previously told investors that it expects to produce “over 10,000” vehicles in 2023, guidance it first provided in May and reiterated in August. Through the end of September, Lucid produced 6,037 EVs in 2023, not including the units in transit to Saudi Arabia at quarter-end.
Lucid had $6.25 billion in available liquidity as of the end of the second quarter, including $5.5 billion in cash and the remainder in available credit lines, which Chief Financial Officer Sherry House said at the time was sufficient to fund the company into 2025.
Lucid will report its third-quarter results after the U.S. markets close Nov. 7.

Annika Kim Constantino,"Johnson & Johnson beats on earnings as medtech, pharmaceutical sales surge","In this article
Johnson & Johnson
on Tuesday reported adjusted earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street’s expectations, and lifted its full-year guidance as sales in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices businesses surged.
It marks J&J’s first quarterly results since it completed the separation from its consumer health spinoff Kenvue
in August, the company’s biggest shake-up in its 137-year history.
Upon that separation in August, J&J also lowered its full-year sales and profit guidance. 
The drugmaker raised that revised outlook on Tuesday: J&J expects 2023 sales of $83.6 billion to $84 billion, compared with previous guidance of $83.2 billion to $84 billion in August. J&J also expects adjusted earnings per share of $10.07 to $10.13, up from a previous forecast of $10.00 to $10.10.
J&J also said it recorded a one-time, non-cash gain of $21 billion as part of the split of Kenvue.
Here’s what J&J reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
J&J’s stock closed nearly 1% on Tuesday. Shares of J&J have dropped more than 12% for the year, putting the company’s market value at roughly $376 billion.
The company, whose financial results are considered a bellwether for the broader health sector, said its sales during the quarter grew 6.8% over the same period last year. 
The pharmaceutical giant reported net income of $4.31 billion, or $1.69 per share. That was flat compared with net income of $4.31 billion, or $1.62 per share, for the same period a year ago.
Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per share were $2.66 for the period.
J&J reported $13.89 billion in pharmaceutical sales, which grew more than 5% year over year. Excluding sales of its unpopular Covid vaccine, the pharmaceutical division raked in $13.85 billion. 
Wall Street was expecting sales of $13.34 billion for the entire business segment, according to StreetAccount. The business, also known as “Innovative Medicine,” is focused on developing drugs across different disease areas.
The company said the growth was driven by sales of Darzalex, a biologic for the treatment of multiple myeloma, along with Erleada, a prostate cancer treatment, and other oncology treatments. 
J&J’s blockbuster drug Stelara, which is used to treat a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, also contributed to that growth. J&J will lose patent protection on Stelara later this year. 
The company said growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of its prostate cancer drug Zytiga and blood cancer drug Imbruvica, which is co-marketed by AbbVie
and will be subject to the first round of Medicare drug price negotiations. 
J&J’s Covid vaccine also weighed on pharmaceutical sales growth. This quarter was the second without any U.S. sales from J&J’s Covid vaccine, which brought in $41 million in international revenue.
“Our success was never dependent on the Covid vaccine,” J&J CFO Joseph Wolk said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”
Meanwhile, sales for the company’s medical devices business rose to nearly $7.46 billion, up 10% from the third quarter of 2022. That came in under Wall Street’s expectations of $7.58 billion, according to StreetAccount.
J&J said its acquisition of Abiomed, a cardiovascular medical technology company, in December fueled the year-over-year rise.
J&J said growth came from electrophysiological products, which evaluate the heart’s electrical system and help doctors understand the cause of abnormal heart rhythms.
Wound closure products and devices for orthopedic trauma, or serious injuries of the skeletal or muscular system, contributed, along with contact lenses.
The third-quarter results come amid investor anxiety over the thousands of lawsuits claiming that J&J’s talc-based products were contaminated with the carcinogenic asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer and several deaths.
Those products, including J&J’s namesake baby powder, now fall under Kenvue. But J&J will assume all talc-related liabilities that arise in the U.S. and Canada.
In 2021, J&J offloaded its talc liabilities into a new subsidiary, LTL Management, and immediately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. But a federal bankruptcy judge in July rejected J&J’s second attempt to resolve those lawsuits in bankruptcy.
J&J previously said LTL Management intends to appeal the decision.
The quarterly results also come as J&J begins price talks with the federal Medicare program over its drug Xarelto, which is used to prevent blood clotting to reduce the risk of stroke.
President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022, empowered Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time in the program’s six-decade history. J&J signed an agreement to participate in the price talks last month, even after it sued the Biden administration to halt the process in July.
Wolk said during an earnings call Tuesday that J&J submitted all requested information in compliance with the federal government’s negotiation process.
But Wolk also reiterated the company’s opposition to the negotiations, “We continue to believe the IRA’s price-setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients as we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by us and others.”"
Drew Richardson,"Tupperware shares surge after company replaces CEO, shuffles board","In this article
Tupperware
on Tuesday appointed Laurie Ann Goldman as its new CEO and shook up its board as the iconic brand tries to overcome its recent struggles.
Shares of Tupperware closed 8% higher at $2.18 Tuesday. However, the stock is down 47% so far this year, and its market cap is just over $100 million.
The company warned investors earlier this year about its ability to survive as a going concern. It has delayed its financial reporting several times this year amid ongoing financial struggles. In an August securities filing, the company said it identified “multiple prior period misstatements and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.”
Goldman’s predecessor, Miguel Fernandez, worked just three years as the company’s CEO. The container maker also appointed three new members to its board, with Fernandez departing the board, the company said in a statement.
Goldman had previously served as CEO of Avon North America and Spanx.
“Now is the right time to bring in new leadership, and Laurie Ann is exceptionally well-suited to advance our long-term strategy and accelerate growth,” said Susan Cameron, Tupperware’s chair.

Diana Olick,"Homebuilder sentiment drops to 10-month low, as mortgage rates soar","Builder confidence in the market for single-family homes dropped to the lowest level since January, as builders contend with a market dominated by high mortgage rates and costs for financing.
The monthly National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped 4 points to 40 in October, and September’s read was revised down 1 point. Anything below 50 is considered negative. This marks the third straight monthly decline in builder confidence.
Builders point squarely to mortgage rates, which are now at a 23-year high. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has remained over 7% for two months. Affordability has fallen to near record lows.
“Builders have reported lower levels of buyer traffic, as some buyers, particularly younger ones, are priced out of the market because of higher interest rates,” said Alicia Huey, NAHB’s chairman and a homebuilder and developer from Birmingham, Alabama. “Higher rates are also increasing the cost and availability of builder development and construction loans, which harms supply and contributes to lower housing affordability.”
Of the index’s three components, current sales conditions fell 4 points to 46, sales expectations in the next six months dropped 5 points to 44, and buyer traffic dropped 4 points to 26.
In order to get buyers in the door, builders are using more incentives again. This includes buying down mortgage interest rates. About 62% of builders reported offering sales incentives of all forms in October, up from 59% in September and tied with the previous high for this cycle set in December 2022.
In addition, 32% of builders said they cut home prices. That is unchanged from the previous month but still the highest rate since December (35%). The average price discount is steady at 6%.
“The housing affordability crisis can only be solved by adding additional attainable, affordable supply,” said Robert Dietz, NAHB’s chief economist. “Boosting housing production would help reduce the shelter inflation component that was responsible for more than half of the overall Consumer Price Index increase in September and aid the Fed’s mission to bring inflation back down to 2%.  However, uncertainty regarding monetary policy is contributing to affordability challenges in the market.”
Regionally, on a three-month moving average, builder sentiment in the Northeast fell 4 points to 50 and in the Midwest dropped 3 points to 39. In the South it fell 5 points to 49, and in the West it fell 6 points to 41.

Hugh Son,Bank of America tops profit estimates on better-than-expected interest income,"In this article
Bank of America
topped estimates for third-quarter profit on Tuesday on stronger-than-expected interest income.
Here’s what the company reported:
Profit rose 10% to $7.8 billion, or 90 cents per share, from $7.1 billion, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said in a release. Revenue climbed 2.9% to $25.32 billion, edging out the LSEG estimate.
Bank of America said interest income rose 4% to $14.4 billion, roughly $300 million more than analysts had anticipated, fueled by higher rates and loan growth. The bank’s provision for credit losses also came in better than expected, at $1.2 billion, under the $1.3 billion estimate.
Shares of Bank of America closed more than 2% higher Tuesday.
The results show Bank of America avoided major pitfalls related to loan losses and higher rates, analyst Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo wrote in a note. He called it an “okay quarter” that fell short of JPMorgan and Citigroup’s results.
CEO Brian Moynihan said the second biggest U.S. bank by assets continued to grow, despite signs of an economic slowdown.
“We added clients and accounts across all lines of business,” Moynihan said. “We did this in a healthy but slowing economy that saw U.S. consumer spending still ahead of last year but continuing to slow.”
Bank of America was supposed to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of higher interest rates this year. Instead, the company’s stock has been the worst performer among its big bank peers in 2023. That’s because, under Moynihan, the lender piled into low-yielding, long-dated securities during the Covid pandemic. Those securities lost value as interest rates climbed.
That’s made Bank of America more sensitive to the recent surge in the 10-year Treasury yield than its peers — and more similar to some regional banks that are also nursing underwater bonds.
Unrealized losses at the lender deepened in the quarter, reaching $131 billion on its portfolio of held-to-maturity bonds. Most of the losses were tied to mortgage securities.
“Clearly, this held-to-maturity portfolio has been a thorn in the side of the stock,” UBS analyst Erika Najarian said during Tuesday’s conference call as she prodded management for more details on the bank.
The situation has pressured the bank’s net interest income, or NII, which is a key metric that analysts will be watching this quarter. In July, the bank’s CFO, Alastair Borthwick, affirmed previous guidance that NII would be roughly $57 billion for 2023.
On Tuesday, Borthwick told analysts that the “good news” on net interest income is that it will trough in the fourth quarter and begin to grow again in the middle of 2024.  
Bank of America stock had fallen 18% this year through Monday, trailing the 10% gain of rival JPMorgan Chase
.
Last week, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo
and Citigroup each topped expectations for third-quarter profit, helped by better-than-expected credit costs. Morgan Stanley
is scheduled to post results Wednesday.

Laya Neelakandan,StubHub sees 60% jump in ticket sales for NBA season as global interest surges,"With the National Basketball Association season tipping off next week, StubHub sees ticket sales up nearly 60% compared to last year, with the Los Angeles Lakers returning to the top of the list as the most in-demand team.
The ticket exchange’s annual NBA preview breaks down the company’s projections for the upcoming basketball season based on years of data, according to spokesperson Adam Budelli. The season kicks off Oct. 24.
Across the board, Budelli told CNBC that all teams are seeing an encouraging rise in demand this season, with international interest surging. Fans from 92 countries — up 24 from last season — are flocking to North American games, he said. Those international sales will be up 120% from last season, StubHub predicted, with the most popular countries attending NBA games including Australia, the United Kingdom and Brazil.
“It’s hard to pinpoint one specific factor, but I would say across live events as a whole, we certainly have seen cross-border travel for live events increased and rebound to a higher point than when it was pre-pandemic,” Budelli said.
The NBA has been increasingly dominated by international stars such as the Denver Nuggets’ Nikola Jokić, the Milwaukee Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo and San Antonio Spurs rookie Victor Wembanyama. The league’s international reach, likewise, will likely factor into its upcoming media rights negotiations.
Budelli said the Lakers, which features superstars LeBron James and Anthony Davis, have been the top team in StubHub’s projections four times since 2017. One notable absence in the list, however, is last season’s NBA champion the Denver Nuggets, which Budelli said the company is monitoring and expects to rise in popularity as the season progresses.
He also noted that ticket sales more than doubled after Damian Lillard was traded to the already-potent Milwaukee Bucks on Sept. 27, with the team’s home opener expected to be the highest selling game of the season. Budelli said Lillard’s trade is likely “the biggest mover” of the season, pushing the team up six spots on the list compared to last year.
On the road, the Golden State Warriors, who added star guard Chris Paul to their high-scoring lineup, have the highest average ticket price for their away game schedule, StubHub said.
Budelli said the Knicks host five of the projected top 10 most popular games, more than any other team, as they just barely inch behind the Lakers as the top team. The Knicks have outpaced their sales from last season by 80%, according to StubHub.
Still, Budelli said the projections are subject to change, and StubHub is excited to monitor how the teams — and players — shake out as the season progresses.
“It definitely has the usual suspects on top, but as it goes, that can fluctuate and move throughout the season,” Budelli said. “And there’s star players that break out and rookies and things like that, but it’s all there, and I think those trends speak for themselves.”"
Michael Wayland,"In rare move, Ford executive chair calls on UAW to make a deal","In this article
DEARBORN, Mich. – Ford Motor
Executive Chair Bill Ford on Monday warned that an ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers threatens the future livelihood of the company as well as the American automotive industry.
Ford, who has been a part of UAW negotiations since 1982, pleaded with union members and leaders to work with the company, instead of against it, to reach a tentative deal to “end to this acrimonious round of talks.”
Such comments by the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford are uncharacteristic during contract talks with the UAW.
“We are at a crossroads,” Ford said during a news conference at the company’s massive Rouge Complex in metro Detroit. “Choosing the right path is not just about Ford’s future and our ability to compete. This is about the future of the American automobile industry.”
Ford, ahead of speaking on stage, told reporters he wanted to “elevate” the conversation about the contract negotiations. Ford said he didn’t want to get personal in his remarks because “it doesn’t matter” at this point.
“The UAW’s leaders have called us the enemy in these negotiations. But I will never consider our employees as enemies. This should not be Ford versus the UAW,” Ford said. “It should be Ford and the UAW vs. Toyota and Honda, Tesla, and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home.”
UAW President Shawn Fain countered Ford’s plea by ratcheting up the pressure.
“Bill Ford knows exactly how to settle this strike. Instead of threatening to close the Rouge, he should call up [Ford CEO] Jim Farley, tell him to stop playing games and get a deal done, or we’ll close the Rouge for him,” he said in a statement. “It’s not the UAW and Ford against foreign automakers. It’s autoworkers everywhere against corporate greed. If Ford wants to be the all-American auto company, they can pay all-American wages and benefits. Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy — they’re the UAW members of the future.”
Ford did not threaten to close the Rouge Complex in his remarks. He did mention if American carmakers such as Ford lose to the competition, then jobs, future investments and “factories like the one we are in today” will be lost.
Ford’s remarks come after a week of contentious talks between the company and the UAW, including the union unexpectedly announcing a strike Wednesday night at the company’s highly profitable Kentucky Truck Plant.
More than 19,000 of Ford’s 57,000 UAW members are currently impacted by the strike, including more than 16,600 striking workers. Another roughly 2,480 employees have been laid off as a result of the work stoppage.
Ford last week said it was “at the limit” of what it can offer the UAW in terms of economic concessions.
The company’s most recent proposal included 23% to 26% wage increases depending on classification; retention of platinum health-care benefits; ratification bonuses; reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments; and other benefits.
Overall, only about 34,000 U.S. autoworkers with the companies – or roughly 23% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers – are currently on strike.
The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14.
Fain last week said the union has entered a “new phase” of the targeted strikes in which it would no longer pre-announce the work stoppages, as it had been.
Fain has said it’s ultimately up to the members to decide when the strike ends, not UAW leadership.
Opinions of the strike and current contract proposals varied on picket lines Monday outside Ford’s nearby Michigan Assembly Plant, which was the first of three facilities to go on strike last month.
“I trust Shawn Fain,” said Latosha Smith, a four-year worker at the plant. “All the steps he’s taken, it’s for the cause.”
Tamika Genus, a worker at the plant for roughly five years, said of course she’d like it to come to a resolution, but “it’s worth it.” She later added, “We’re doing what we’ve got to do.”
Jeff Nichol, a body shop worker at the plant who was laid off due to the strike, said he wishes that the sides “would come to a conclusion a lot sooner than later.” He also would like union leaders to be more transparent regarding exact details of the company’s proposals.
Nichol, who’s been autoworker for over 11 years, said he knows it’s an “unpopular opinion,” but he’d support Ford’s current proposal, including a 23% wage increase.
“What I’ve been getting is good enough, so any little bit of extra does help, especially with the current economy,” he said. “The way I look at it, too, is the amount of time that we’re off, that also plays into how long it’s going to take for us to make a difference for the amount of money that we lose every single week.”
Ford said Friday employees who have been on strike since Sept. 15 have on average lost about $4,000 in pretax income through four weeks of the strike.
Correction: Only about 34,000 U.S. autoworkers with the companies are currently on strike. An earlier version mischaracterized the figure."
Sarah Whitten,Taylor Swift Eras Tour film posts second-best October opening weekend,"In this article
Taylor Swift and AMC
have collected the receipts and results are in: the Eras Tour concert film is the second-highest domestic opener of October ever.
The film tallied $92.8 million during its first three days in theaters, falling shy of AMC’s expectations, which forecasted a $95 million to $97 million haul, and box office analysts’ calls for a $100 million-plus opening.
Still, Swift’s theatrical debut is an enormous success, given its genre and the limits of its release. The Eras Tour concert film has already shattered records and is likely to break a few more before its run is done.
Box office analysts admitted that their predictions were lofty, but told CNBC that the film was a “unicorn” in the theatrical world. No concert film had ever elicited such fervor so quickly for ticket sales or drummed up so much demand with theater chains. There was also the base price for tickets, which were 40% higher than traditional movie releases. Experts suggested the film could see a bigger bump in overall box office.
But, the film also had some headwinds to contend with. Thursday previews weren’t announced until less than a day before tickets would be made available, and Friday showings didn’t start until 6 p.m. local time. This meant that many audience members had likely already secured tickets to see the film later in the weekend, and the film missed out on the business that early showings Friday could have generated.
So, the Eras Tour film snared just $2.8 million in last-minute Thursday night previews for a total of $37.5 million on its opening day. Meanwhile, the highest October opening, Warner Bros.′
“Joker” from 2019, secured $13.3 million from Thursday previews, feeding a $39.3 million opening day. For the whole weekend, “Joker” scored $96.2 million domestically.
The third-highest October opening was Sony’s
“Venom: Let There Be Carnage” from 2021, which snared $11.6 million from Thursday night previews leading to a $37.4 million opening Friday.
Additionally, while Swift’s film arrived in 3,855 theaters, the most for any concert film, “Joker” opened in nearly 4,400 locations, according to data from Comscore. “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” opened in 4,225 locations.
Going forward, comparisons between Swift’s film and other releases will be difficult, since the Eras Tour is doing weekend-only engagements. This also makes predicting the film’s second week drop difficult, as there are no close concert film comparisons and it’s unclear how the lack of mid-week showings could impact foot traffic on the next weekend. Typically, blockbuster-style releases drop between 50% and 70% in their second weekend.
The Eras Tour’s theatrical run is scheduled to end Nov. 5.
AMC reported that the Eras Tour concert film tallied $123.5 million globally, putting it on pace to top the $262.5 million international haul of 2009′s “Michael Jackson’s This Is It.”"
Michael Sheetz,"Space investors followed government contracts in the third quarter, report says","Investment in the space sector, especially from venture capital, is consistently flowing into companies that are pursuing and winning government contracts, according to a report Monday by New York-based Space Capital.
“In this market – 21 months into this liquidity crunch – people are chasing government dollars. They’re more willing to chase government dollars and infrastructure companies have line of sight to a lot of that,” Space Capital managing partner Chad Anderson told CNBC.
The firm’s third quarter report found that space infrastructure companies brought in $1.6 billion of private investment during the third quarter. That brings the sector to $8.4 billion in investment year-to-date, surpassing the total $8.3 billion invested in 2022.
The quarterly Space Capital report divides investment in the industry into three technology categories: infrastructure, distribution and application. Infrastructure includes what would be commonly considered as space companies, such as firms that build rockets and satellites.
Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter.
Anderson noted that “the infrastructure companies have been pretty resilient through market cycles,” a factor he attributed to “higher competitive moats” such as higher capital needs, longer development timelines and significant intellectual property advantages.
Venture capital accounted for 50% of the third quarter’s investment in space infrastructure, tracking with the historical trend of VCs representing the primary contributors to space investment. 
Space Capital highlighted the trend of companies and investors chasing government funds as apparent in sub-sectors within space infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets such as space stations and the moon.
“You look at emerging industries – these are all government-led markets. So it’s actually quite easy to size up the market – you know how many dollars are available, how big the market is currently and how big it’s going to be over the next few years – because you already know what the government budgets are,” Anderson said.
Space Capital found that “the majority of private investment has preferred” space stations among the sector’s emerging markets “when, in actuality, Lunar and Logistics are significantly larger markets.”

As it stands, the industry faces several questions about AI and writing now that the deal is ratified, particularly about copyright law, detection of AI usage and how studios will behave. AI also remains a major sticking point in the ongoing actors’ strike as talks broke down on Thursday in part due to a disagreement on AI guardrails between actors and studios.
Writers and actors have long feared the increasing prominence of AI, primarily due to concerns that the technology could replace the need for them in Hollywood.
“I hope I’m wrong, but I do think that the use of AI is going to take over the entertainment industry,” Justine Bateman, a member of the writers, directors and actors guilds, told CNBC in July.
The WGA agreement established that AI cannot be used to undermine a writer’s credit or be used as a means to reduce a writer’s compensation. The contract does, however, leave room for studios to train AI using preexisting material. WGA’s original May proposal, which triggered the strike, would have disallowed studios from using any materials to train AI outright.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.
Hollywood studios training AI with preexisting materials could create a whole new set of issues for writers by allowing the studios to use previous work to generate similar materials without the writer’s consent or even awareness.
It is in this gray area that thorny issues could sprout, according to Lisa Callif, partner at Beverly Hills entertainment law firm Donaldson Callif Perez LLP.
“One of the biggest issues we’re dealing with is the misappropriation of how AI uses source material and creates new material out of it without permission,” Callif said. “How do you control this? I think it really comes down to human behavior.”
Allowing studios to train AI with preexisting material was a “punt” down the line, and studios will inevitably “push to use AI as far as possible,” said Peter Csathy, founder and chairman of media legal advisory company Creative Media.
“The biggest inhibitor is probably existing copyright law,” he said.
AI has upended traditional copyright law in the U.S.
Prominent authors, including Jodi Picoult and George R.R. Martin, sued OpenAI earlier this year for copyright infringement, accusing the startup of using their published works to train ChatGPT.
“We’re having productive conversations with many creators around the world, including the Authors Guild, and have been working cooperatively to understand and discuss their concerns about AI,” a spokesperson for OpenAI told ABC News.
In January, a group of visual artists sued Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt, arguing that Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion software scraped billions of copyrighted images from the internet without licensure and allowed Midjourney and DeviantArt AI tools to generate images in the artists’ style.
In the United States, non-human-generated content is not eligible for copyright, which presents challenges for studios wishing to utilize AI.
“It’s clear from the U.S. copyright laws that AI-generated content is not capable of protection or exclusivity, and the studios will not have that,” Csathy said. “They need to own their intellectual property.”
Accusations of copyright infringement have have long relied on the general principle of substantial similarity. In other words, if one body of work is found to be substantially similar to an earlier body of work, the original artist would be entitled to compensation.
Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that photographer Lynn Goldsmith’s pictures taken of late pop superstar Prince were entitled to copyright protection after artist Andy Warhol, who died in 1987, used one of her unlicensed photographs as a starting point to add his signature bold and colorful style. After Prince’s death in 2016, Vanity Fair licensed one of Warhol’s images created using Goldsmith’s original photograph without compensating Goldsmith in any form.
The ruling has particular applicability to writers, Csathy said.
“In the case [of using AI], if there’s substantial similarity to an existing script and it takes a commercial opportunity away, they could claim copyright infringement and cite the Warhol case,” Csathy said.
AI regulation is notoriously minimal given how quickly the technology evolves. But some, like Csathy, say that detection and guardrail technology is advancing.
Intel
Labs is behind the development of “My Art My Choice,” an initiative that aims to protect copyrighted works from being used in AI learning. The technology works by adding a protective layer over an image that makes the image unusable by an AI learning model. The team plans to apply the technology to other modalities in the future.
Earlier this month, machine learning company HuggingFace announced a collaboration with media verification company Truepic to embed a digital “watermark” into images to easily identify authorship, edits and label AI-generated content.
The advancements are reminiscent of digital fingerprinting tool Content ID, which quelled fears that YouTube would thwart copyright regulations in its early days. The tool, introduced in 2007, has since been scaled to detect copyright infringements on a massive scale. Content ID flagged more than 826 million possible copyright violations in the second half of 2022, nearly all automatically, according to a July YouTube Transparency Report. The claims generated $9 billion in payouts to rights holders.
“The technology is increasing on the detection side,” Csathy said. “There’s a whole burgeoning industry of forensic AI that’s going to be policing this.”
Despite strides being made in content verification and AI detection technology, many are still not convinced that this will be enough contain the risks of AI.
“The courts will say there are hundreds of thousands or millions of works in the training set,” Csathy said. The courts will ask “so how can you possibly say that there was an infringement and not a fair use of your works? It’s going to be constant push and pull. There’s no way to regulate this technology perfectly.”

Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Rite Aid files for bankruptcy amid slowing sales, opioid litigation","In this article
Rite Aid
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey on Sunday and said it would begin restructuring to significantly reduce its debt.
The company said it reached a deal with creditors on a restructuring plan that includes evaluating its retail footprint and closing underperforming locations.
Rite Aid also said lenders agreed to extend $3.45 billion in new funding to “provide sufficient liquidity” as it embarks on its restructuring plan.
The beleaguered drugstore chain has been grappling with slowing sales, mounting debt and a slew of lawsuits that allege the company helped fuel the nation’s opioid epidemic by oversupplying painkillers. 
During its most recent quarter ended June 3, revenue fell to $5.65 billion, down from $6.01 billion in the year-ago period. Its net loss widened to $306.7 million, or $5.56 per share, compared with a net loss of $110.2 million, or $2.03 per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
As a result of the rough quarter, Rite Aid lowered its fiscal 2024 outlook and warned investors it expects to lose between $650 million and $680 million for the full year, which is slated to end in late February.
Rite Aid’s retail pharmacy segment has long been a key growth driver for the company, but that hasn’t been enough to offset its mounting losses.
Plummeting demand for Covid vaccines and testing, a membership reduction in the company’s prescription drug plan, and a loss of customers from its Elixir pharmacy benefits business have contributed to a slowdown in revenue at the struggling drug chain.
On Sunday, the company appointed Jeffrey Stein as its new chief executive officer and chief restructuring officer as well as a member of its board. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as interim CEO since January and will remain on the company’s board.
Rite Aid Chairman Bruce Bodaken said in a statement: “Jeff is a proven leader with a strong track record of guiding companies through financial restructurings. We look forward to benefitting from his contributions and leveraging his expertise as we strengthen Rite Aid’s foundation and position the business for long-term success.”
Stein said he has “tremendous confidence in this business and the turnaround strategy that has been developed in recent months.”
Drugstores like Rite Aid have faced an existential crisis as shoppers increasingly turn to retailers like Amazon
, Target
, Walmart
and others for toothpaste, shampoo and other staples — often at a cheaper price and with the convenience of delivery to customers’ doors.
Rite Aid has also struggled to keep up with its bigger rivals, CVS
and Walgreens
, as those companies have pivoted to a health-care focus and made sizable investments to match.
CVS has opened in-store Minute Clinics, which resemble walk-in urgent-care facilities, and turned more of its stores into HealthHubs, or locations with a longer list of medical services. 
It has expanded its reach in health care by acquiring Caremark, one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers, health insurer Aetna and, most recently, primary-care company Oak Street Health.
Walgreens has also struck pricey deals to expand its reach in health care. It’s become the majority owner of primary-care company VillageMD and plans to open up doctor offices next to many of its drugstores. 
Newer — and well-capitalized — health-care entrants have also intensified the competitive threat. Amazon closed its acquisition of primary-care provider One Medical in a $3.9 billion deal earlier this year and acquired online pharmacy PillPack in 2018. Walmart, which has pharmacies in its thousands of stores, has opened a growing network of medical clinics in parts of the country.
Rite Aid’s financial position and competitive disadvantages are compounded by the many lawsuits it’s facing that allege the company contributed to the nation’s opioid epidemic by knowingly filling prescriptions for painkillers that did not meet legal requirements.
The Department of Justice filed a suit against Rite Aid earlier this year, claiming that it violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling thousands of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances such as fentanyl and oxycodone.
Rite Aid has asked a court to dismiss the department’s lawsuit and denied allegations it filled unlawful opioid prescriptions.

Laya Neelakandan,An Absolut Vodka and Sprite canned cocktail is coming next year,"In this article
Coca-Cola
is teaming up with Pernod Ricard
to launch a new ready-to-drink and premixed cocktail beginning 2024, the companies announced Monday.
The new cocktail will contain a mix of Absolut Vodka and Sprite, the companies said. The drink will be available in two versions with Sprite and Sprite Zero Sugar. The debut is planned for early next year in select European countries including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany.
The canned cocktail industry has been growing in popularity in the past couple of years, with a 2022 report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. finding ready-to-drink beverages to be the fastest-growing spirits category in both revenue and volume. The announcement didn’t say when the Absolut and Sprite drinks would hit the U.S. market.
The new drinks join a host of expanding alcoholic beverages in Coke’s portfolio in the past few years, including last year’s Jack-and-Coke cocktail in a can.
“We are expanding in the alcohol ready-to-drink space, including products that use select brands from our core portfolio,” said James Quincey, CEO and chair of Coca-Cola, in a statement. “We are excited about our new relationship with Pernod Ricard and look forward to the introduction of Absolut & Sprite.”
Vodka is already one of the most popular bases for alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, and lemon-lime soft drinks such as Sprite are one of the most popular mixers in premixed cocktails."
Sarah Whitten,Taylor Swift Eras Tour is the highest-grossing domestic concert film ever,"In this article
Box office analysts became Swifties in the lead-up to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert film release, estimating blockbuster-style opening weekend numbers.
And Swift delivered.
While the pop singer fell short of the $100 million benchmark, domestic ticket sales still topped $95 million, according to distributor AMC Entertainment.
The theater chain provided a range of $95 million to $97 million for the film’s opening weekend on Sunday, with expectations that an official figure will be provided on Monday once all tickets have been tallied.
“The film’s debut is an undeniable tentpole-level success despite the challenges of predicting what it might achieve,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “Swift, her fans, and theatrical exhibition should all be celebrating the results.”
Already, the film has shattered records, becoming the highest-grossing concert film release domestically, surpassing Justin Beiber’s “Never Say Never” film release, which hauled in $73 million over the course of its run in theaters in 2011, in a single weekend. And it easily beat Miley Cyrus’ “Best of Both Worlds” record opening of $31.1 million from 2008.
Swift’s Eras Tour film is also the widest-released concert film in history, arriving in more than 3,850 domestic locations during its debut.
Monday’s official tally will unveil if Swift was able to capture the highest opening of October, currently held by 2019′s “The Joker” ($96.2 million), and if it is the sixth or seventh-highest opening of 2023. Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” secured $95.6 million when it opened in May.
There’s also a possibility that word of mouth and fan’s love of Swift could send more moviegoers to theaters on Sunday, pushing it closer to that $100 million figure.
“As cautioned in recent weeks, forecasts were always going to be incredibly volatile given the highly unique nature of this release,” Robbins said. “Variables such as average ticket price, assessing how frontloaded Swift’s fan base would make the film’s presales, and whether or not any traditional marketing would bring out non-Swifties all weighed heavily on the wide range of possible outcomes.”
Initially, expectations said Swift could tally between $40 million and $60 million on Friday, on her way to an opening weekend draw of as much as $150 million. The film scored $39 million on Friday, just shy of the forecasted range and included $2.8 million from last-minute Thursday night previews, which were announced less than 24 hours before they were available for purchase.
“Swift’s excitement-inducing reputation and the unprecedented nature of the release led to a massive outpouring of interest in the film certainly contributed to some overblown expectations of a $100 million plus weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “But that should not detract from the enormity of this box office achievement.”
A whopping 60% of tickets for the weekend were bought in advance, according to data from EntTelligence, one of the highest rates the movie data firm has ever seen. Typically, big tentpoles see 40% of tickets sold ahead of time.
Around 4.8 million people were estimated to have attended the film over the weekend, with an average ticket price of $20.75, EntTelligence reported. Nearly 80% of the audience was female.
International box office figures were not immediately available on Sunday, but with a solid domestic opening, expectations are high that the film can surpass the $262.5 million global haul of “Michael Jackson’s This Is It” during its limited run in theaters.
Swift’s film has weekend-only engagements in theaters, instead of daily screenings, so comparisons to other releases will be difficult in the coming weeks, but weekend-to-weekend figures will be comparable.
“The question now is what the Swift film will do for an encore in the coming days and weeks,” Dergarabedian said. “Reports of a spectacular in-theater experience bodes well for the long-term playability of the film and guarantees the film will easily eclipse the $100 million mark in the domestic market.”"
Amelia Lucas,Halloween is candy’s biggest holiday. Here’s how Snickers maker Mars prepares,"In this article
For 11 months of the year, Tim LeBel is Mars Wrigley’s president of sales. But for the month of October, he dons a new title: chief Halloween officer.
For decades, the fall holiday has been the biggest day of the year for candy makers. In recent years, Halloween has also stretched to become a three-month season for Mars and rivals such as Hershey
, Ferrero and Mondelez
, and the retailers who stock their candy.
The National Retail Federation predicts consumers will spend $3.6 billion on Halloween candy this year, up from $3.1 billion last year, even as many shoppers pull back spending elsewhere.
“We know that during difficult economic times, consumers are particularly interested in enjoying kind of the simple things in life … like Halloween,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck told investors in July on the company’s quarterly conference call.
Unlike Hershey, family-owned Mars doesn’t report its financial results, but disclosed nearly $45 billion in annual revenue in 2021. While best known for a candy portfolio that includes M&M’s, Snickers, Three Musketeers and Twix, Mars also makes ice cream, chewing gum and pet food.
With the stakes so high for Halloween, Mars starts planning for the holiday two years in advance. LeBel said he sits down with key retailers to discuss trends across flavors, packaging and sustainability.
“A lot of those things take two years to develop and execute to bring to market,” LeBel told CNBC. “So the things we looked at in 2021, you’re starting to see this year in 2023.”
That’s phase one of planning. The next stage happens in the three weeks of November after last Halloween. Mars once again sits down with retailers, this time for a post mortem on its candies’ performance.
“What items did we not make enough of? What items maybe went off trend?” LeBel said.
This year, Mars has a couple of tricks up its sleeve, such as Skittles Shriekers. Each bag includes classic Skittles with a few sour-flavored ones that look the same as the rest of the bag.
The company is also leaning into online shopping. Last year, roughly a third of consumers bought Halloween items online. This year, Mars has teamed up with digital convenience store Gopuff to make sure everyone has enough candy to pass out on Halloween. Consumers whose stash is running low can visit MMsHalloweenRescueSquad.com and receive a delivery of a free backup supply of Mars candy in under an hour in participating locations, while supplies last.
But Mars’ Halloween plans will always include the classics, such as its Snickers bars, which are the second best-selling Halloween candy, trailing only Hershey’s Reese’s cups. Three of Mars’ variety bags cracked the top 10 for most popular assortments, according to the company.
Retailers’ insights may lead Mars to pivot its plans for the next Halloween season, which starts just nine months later, before temperatures cool and pumpkin spice lattes return to Starbucks’
menu.
″[Retailers] realize that having our portfolio on display from August through October captures multiple consumer occasions,” LeBel said.
Those moments include picking up a variety pack of candy during back-to-school shopping, snacking during spooky movie nights and the all-important trick-or-treating on Halloween.
Still, 48% of Halloween candy sales happen during the last week of October, according to LeBel. Those last-minute shoppers mean that candy manufacturers and retailers need to be ready to meet that demand.
All of Mars’ planning has paid off this year. The company exceeded its production targets this Halloween season.
“I actually still have some in our warehouses, ready to ship,” LeBel said.
Correction: This article has been updated to correct the link to Mars’ collaboration with Gopuff."
John Rosevear,What to make of the UAW’s shifting strike tactics after the latest escalation,"In this article
DETROIT – A shift in strategy by the United Auto Workers union this week has some analysts wondering if the parties are — perhaps, counterintuitively — getting closer to a deal.
On Wednesday the union initiated a surprise work stoppage at Ford Motor’s
Kentucky Truck Plant. The strike involves 8,700 workers and affects the most crucial plant, by far – responsible for $25 billion in revenue annually – that the union has walked out on since the strikes began Sept. 15. It’s expected to quickly have a ripple effect on other Ford plants and suppliers.
It also ushered in what UAW President Shawn Fain characterized as a “new phase” of strikes and contract negotiations with Ford, General Motors
and Chrysler-parent Stellantis
, giving the union the element of surprise to keep the automakers on edge during the ongoing negotiations, Fain told members in a Friday presentation.
“We’re entering a new phase of this fight and it demands a new approach,” Fain said Friday. “We’re done waiting until Fridays to escalate our strike.
“We are prepared at any time to call on more locals to stand up and walk out,” he said.
Until this week, Fain had announced all of the union’s new strikes on Fridays, during what has become a weekly livestreamed update for union members.
Some Wall Street analysts and industry experts think this week’s shift in strategy could be a sign that UAW leaders feel a deal with Ford is close, and that they’re increasing pressure as a tactic to get the deal over the finish line — and to help sell a potential tentative deal to their members.
“We continue to believe the escalation at [Ford] this week is a sign the talks may be coming to an end. KY Truck is likely Ford’s most profitable plant, and therefore the strike is the highest level of escalation, aside from a national strike,” Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a Friday note. “This escalation would likely be done to push for final terms.”
But the UAW’s leaders may be looking one more step ahead, to the process of selling a tentative deal with Ford to their members. The thinking is that to convince members to ratify a potential new contract, UAW President Shawn Fain and the union’s leadership will need to convince autoworkers that the union has fought as hard as possible to have their demands met. Striking Ford’s most profitable factory might be one way to do that.
Wolfe Research’s Rod Lache argued the Kentucky strike may allow UAW leadership to claim that they did all that could be done, especially if it leads to one or two more concessions from Ford.
“In another week or two, Fain should be able to credibly announce that he has forced Ford into one last capitulation (battery plants?), and that UAW members have secured the last few ounces of wage, benefits, and job protection concessions that they can get,” Lache wrote Thursday to investors.
Only about 34,000 U.S. automakers with the companies, or roughly 23% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike.
“Hitting a very high-dollar, high-profitable plant, it certainly gets Ford’s attention very quickly,” said Art Wheaton, a labor professor at the Worker Institute at Cornell University. “It also sends a huge message to Stellantis and General Motors.”
Wheaton argues the escalation in Kentucky may just be the beginning. There are plenty more plants the union could hit for each of the automakers, including the full-size pickup truck plants owned by all three and large SUV plants at GM and Stellantis.
GM avoided a strike at its most profitable SUV plant in Texas last week with a last-minute offer to include battery cell plant workers under the company’s national agreement, however details regarding how that will be done are believed to be still being negotiated.
While Fain declined to expand strikes against GM and Stellantis Friday, Wells Fargo’s Langan thinks that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re spared.
“The lack of GM & STLA strike today, even though both have not matched F’s offer, would be consistent with the UAW holding out the most profitable plants for a final push,” he wrote in a Friday note.
All of that tea-leaf reading aside, rapid escalation-turned-resolution is just one potential outcome.
Another includes the automakers holding out for the union to deplete its resources, specifically its strike and defense fund. Or, the UAW could continue rotating strikes or filing additional unfair labor practice charges against the companies. Yet another outcome could see the sides seeking mediation or legal resources.
“I think they’ve got to be getting close to some sort of an agreement, or you just have to conclude a reasonable deal is not in the making — and that this is really more a matter of a test of will than anything else,” said Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who specializes in labor issues.
An automaker also could submit what’s known as a “last, best and final offer,” which, as it states, is typically a final proposal when bargainers have reached an impasse.
Ford may be close to that point. An executive said Thursday the automaker was “at the limit” of what it can offer UAW in terms of economic concessions.
The Detroit automakers have largely given into many of the union’s demands, but not all of them.
The companies haven’t waved the white flag on demands for a 32-hour workweek — which was always a nonstarter for the companies and which has largely fallen out of union talking points — and a 40% wage increase.
Ford was up to a record 23% wage increase in its recent contract proposal, with the others not far behind.
Then there’s the outstanding issues of benefits for retirees as well as a return to traditional pension plans and future battery plant jobs and workers.
Industry experts and sources familiar with the talks believe regardless of the outcome, the contracts will have ripple effects on the companies potentially in the way of reorganizations, cost cuts and future investments and jobs.
A former high-ranking bargainer for one of the automakers told CNBC that it’s nearly guaranteed that the companies will cut union jobs through product allocation, plant closures or other means to offset increased labor costs once the contracts are set.
“They’re going to have to pay up. The question is how much,” said the longtime bargainer, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. “This ends up with fewer jobs. That’s how the automakers cut costs.”"
Annika Kim Constantino,"Pharmacy staff from Walgreens, other chains could stage another walkout","In this article
Pharmacy staff from Walgreens
are laying the groundwork for a nationwide walkout and multiple rallies at the end of October to protest unsatisfactory working conditions, and are in talks with employees from other retail pharmacies about joining them, CNBC has learned.
Those efforts, which are still in the planning stages, reflect the growing discontent among retail pharmacy staff, who have complained for years about having to grapple with understaffed teams and increasing work expectations imposed by corporate management. The Covid pandemic only exacerbated those issues, as new duties like testing and vaccination stretched pharmacists and technicians even thinner. 
Those frustrations came to a head in recent weeks, as some pharmacy staff from Walgreens locations around the country and CVS
stores in the Kansas City area engaged in separate walkouts. Those demonstrations – and the planning for a broader work stoppage – add to what has been one of the most active years for the labor movement in recent U.S. history.
A Walgreens organizer, an employee of the chain who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said the walkouts are scheduled for Oct. 30 to Nov. 1. Another organizer named Shane Jerominski, an independent pharmacist who used to work for Walgreens, confirmed those dates. Jerominski is a pharmacy labor advocate who has been actively involved in organizing recent walkouts. 
The Walgreens organizer said they have been in talks with pharmacy staff from other retail chains about participating in the group walkout. The person sees nationwide walkouts across several retail pharmacy chains as the “next step” in the fight against current working conditions.
A Walgreens spokesperson redirected CNBC to the company’s earlier statement in response to the walkouts pharmacy staff held this week.
The spokesperson touted the company’s pharmacy teams in that statement, noting that they work “tirelessly to serve our communities” at nearly 9,000 store locations across the U.S. The spokesperson also acknowledged that the “last few years have required an unprecedented effort from our team members.”
Walgreens is engaged and listening to the concerns of pharmacy staff, the spokesperson said in the statement. In particular, the company said it has been making significant investments in wages and hiring bonuses in order to retain pharmacists in hard-to-staff locations.
Walgreens pharmacists make $57.45 an hour on average, according to employment website Indeed. The company has more than 86,000 health-care service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and other health-related professionals.
Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians work under the company’s U.S. retail pharmacy segment. That division contributes the most sales by far of its business segments, raking in $110 billion in fiscal year 2023.
A CVS employee, who was the main organizer of the Kansas City area walkouts, confirmed that they have been in contact with the Walgreens organizer about getting the CVS pharmacy staff they represent to join the nationwide effort. That employee, who also asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, represents CVS pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in the Kansas City area.
But the CVS employee said whether those employees join will depend on the outcome of a meeting the person has with Prem Shah, the company’s chief pharmacy officer and president of pharmacy and consumer wellness, on Friday.
During that meeting, the employee will assess what CVS has done so far to execute a series of changes it committed to – including adding staff and paid overtime – after the Kansas City area walkouts ended last month. 
The CVS employee said if the meeting goes poorly, the person will reach out to the Walgreens organizer and tell them that the pharmacy staff they represent will be “100% behind” the nationwide walkout effort.
A CVS spokesperson said the company is “not seeing any unusual activity” regarding unplanned pharmacy closures or pharmacist walkouts. The spokesperson added that the company is working with pharmacists to directly address any concerns they might have.  
Pharmacy staff participating in the nationwide effort would also hold demonstrations outside the stores that workers walk out of, according to the people who spoke to CNBC.
Jerominksi said organizers are planning to hold rallies in areas that will see the “largest scale” of participation in the walkout, but no specific store locations have been finalized. He added that rallies were the biggest thing that was missing from the recent Walgreens and CVS walkouts. 
In addition to those rallies and the walkouts, Jerominski and the Walgreens organizer said they are considering pushing for unionization for pharmacy staff not currently represented by one. The vast majority of pharmacists and technicians from Walgreens and CVS have no union representation, while pharmacy staff from a handful of grocery retailers such as Kroger
do, according to Jerominski. 
Organizers are in talks with multiple existing unions, but there is no concrete agreement yet, according to Jerominski. He said the organizations include IAM Healthcare, a union representing thousands of professionals in the health-care industry, and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents food, retail and health-care workers across the U.S. and Canada.
IAM Healthcare did not immediately respond to a request for comment. UFCW directed CNBC to a statement released Thursday in support of the recent walkouts staged by Walgreens and CVS pharmacy staff.
Retail pharmacy staff are concerned that companies like Walgreens and CVS are placing unreasonable demands on employees, without providing enough staffing or resources for them to safely and responsibly execute tasks such as filling prescriptions. The staff believes those working conditions ultimately put patients at risk of serious harm. 
“What we’re doing in our stores is not safe for our customers,” the CVS employee told CNBC. “Improve our working conditions so we can improve the safety and the confidence of our customers that come into our stores.”
In addition to filling and verifying prescriptions, pharmacy employees often have to juggle patient phone calls, administer a growing number of vaccines, work with insurance companies on issues such as copays and reimbursements, perform rapid Covid and flu testing and deal with frustrated customers who are seeing longer wait times due to understaffing.
One Walgreens pharmacy technician in Minnesota, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, likened work shifts to running a marathon. They told CNBC that pharmacy staff always go home “completely overworked and exhausted” after a day of juggling dozens of different tasks.
Walgreens pharmacy employees are asking the company to offer more transparency around how staff hours are assigned to stores, dedicate training time for each new hire and allocate job tasks in a way that matches the staffing levels of a given store location, according to the Walgreens organizer.
Currently, the company sets task expectations based on the number of team members each pharmacy should have instead of how much staff the locations actually have, the organizer said. 
Walgreens said it does not set task-based metrics for staff, noting that the company eliminated it last year.
Pharmacy staff across different chains are also hoping that company management can address their concerns in a more timely fashion, Jerominski said. 
“Pharmacists are kind of on an island where you don’t feel much support,” Jerominski said. “It feels like yelling into the void. You might call a supervisor or a district manager, but you might get a response a week later.” 
A survey from last year shows that pharmacy workers who bring complaints to management sometimes get little response. The survey, conducted by the American Pharmacists Association and the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations, noted that there are “no open mechanisms” for pharmacists and other pharmacy staff to discuss workplace issues with supervisors and management.
Some Walgreens pharmacy staff told CNBC that the rollout of new vaccines this fall, including shots for Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus, has made their workload heavier than usual. 
One pharmacist, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said it is difficult to handle the recent influx of vaccine appointments, especially since those respiratory virus shots all arrived in the U.S. around the same time. The pharmacist described having appointments every 10 minutes, with some patients getting several shots at once.
The pharmacist also described a recent work shift where they were the only immunizer on staff, which made it nearly impossible for them to fill prescriptions and complete other tasks. 
Jerominski, the organizer and pharmacy labor advocate, claimed that immunizations have become a priority for Walgreens and CVS since the margins on vaccines are significantly higher than the average prescription.
One Walgreens pharmacist from Colorado, who also requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, also highlighted how staff increasingly have to deal with frustrated customers. 
That pharmacist said the lack of staffing and resources at some locations can lead to medication delays and errors or longer wait times for appointments, which sets employees up for negative interactions with patients.
The Colorado pharmacist said patients are “rightfully upset” when they can’t pick up critical medications in a quick and seamless way. But it can get emotionally taxing for employees when patients target all of their anger and frustration on staff, the pharmacist said.
Patients can get aggressive or even violent in rare cases, and it’s a “very long process” to get those customers banned from a store to protect employees, the Colorado pharmacist said."

Here’s what the company reported:
The bank said profit surged 35% to $13.15 billion, or $4.33 a share, from a year earlier. That per-share figure includes 17 cents in securities losses and 22 cents in legal expenses. It wasn’t  immediately clear which items were included in LSEG’s $3.96 a share profit estimate.
Revenue climbed 21% to $40.69 billion, helped by the stronger-than-expected net interest income. That measure surged 30% to $22.9 billion, exceeding analysts’ expectations by roughly $600 million. At the same time, credit provisioning of $1.38 billion came in far lower than the $2.39 billion estimate.
JPMorgan’s retail banking division saw profit surge 36% to $5.9 billion, fueled by higher net interest income and the acquisition of First Republic. Its corporate and investment bank saw profit slip 12% to $3.1 billion on declines in trading and advisory revenue.
JPMorgan shares gained 1.5% on Friday following the report.
CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged that the biggest U.S. bank by assets was “over-earning” on net interest income and “below normal” credit costs that will both normalize over time. While surging interest rates caught some smaller peers off guard this year, causing upheaval among regional lenders in March, JPMorgan has navigated the turmoil well so far.
Dimon warned that while American consumers and businesses were healthy, households were spending down cash balances and that tight labor markets and “extremely high government debt levels” meant that interest rates may climb even further from here.
“The war in Ukraine compounded by last week’s attacks on Israel may have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships,” Dimon said. “This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades. While we hope for the best, we prepare the firm for a broad range of outcomes.”
The quarterly report comes after a period of uncertainty for U.S. banks.
Bank stocks plunged last month after the Federal Reserve signaled it would keep interest rates higher for longer than expected to fight inflation amid unexpectedly robust economic growth. The 10-year Treasury yield, a key figure for long-term rates, jumped 74 basis points in the third quarter. One basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Higher rates hit banks in several ways. The industry has been forced to pay up for deposits as customers shift holdings into higher-yielding instruments like money market funds. Rising yields mean the bonds owned by banks fall in value, creating unrealized losses that pressure capital levels. And higher borrowing costs tamp down demand for mortgages and corporate loans.
While smaller competitors have seen net interest income damaged by higher rates this year, JPMorgan continued to benefit from the rate environment.
The bank said Friday it now expects that net interest income will total $88.5 billion this year, up from guidance of $87 billion given in July. It was the fourth time the bank increased its guidance this year.
During a conference call with analysts, Dimon and CFO Jeremy Barnum criticized U.S. regulators’ push to increase capital levels at banks with at least $100 billion in assets. Unless modified, the plan would boost JPMorgan’s required capital by 25%, or $50 billion, according to the bank.
“A capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there’s a lot that does not make sense to us,” Barnum said, adding that regulators have repeatedly said U.S. banks were already well capitalized.
Shares of JPMorgan have climbed 8.7% this year through Thursday, far outperforming the 19% decline of the KBW Bank Index.

Novo Nordisk
on Friday raised its outlook for its full-year sales and operating profit due to soaring demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. 
The revised forecast only confirms the frenzy for those weekly injections, which patients seek for their ability to help them lose significant weight over time. Ozempic and Wegovy have propelled Novo Nordisk to become Europe’s most valuable company.
The Danish drugmaker now expects 2023 sales growth in local currencies of 32% to 38%, from a previous outlook of 27% to 33%, according to a press release. 
Novo Nordisk also expects operating profit growth of 40% to 46%, from 31% to 37% previously.
The new sales outlook for this year primarily reflects higher expectations for Ozempic sales in the U.S. and “gross-to-net sales adjustments for Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S.,” according to the release.
Novo Nordisk is slated to report third-quarter earnings Nov. 2.
The company’s U.S.-listed shares rose about 1% and touched a new 52-week high Friday."
Sarah Whitten,Taylor Swift concert film draws $2.8 million from last-minute previews,"In this article
Taylor Swift fans had just eight hours to buy tickets for last-minute Thursday night previews of her The Eras Tour concert film.
The result was $2.8 million in ticket sales.
While the figure is low in comparison to blockbuster releases from Marvel, DC and Star Wars, it reflects the fact that film wasn’t originally slated for a Thursday release. In fact, fans weren’t told screenings were available early until late Wednesday night, and tickets for 6 p.m. showings weren’t available for purchase until 10 a.m. local time Thursday.
Box office analysts don’t see the small Thursday night haul as any indication of the potential success of Swift’s film.
“A storm is brewing,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “The 11th hour announcement of the availability of Thursday night pre-shows produced an early box office number that belies the true potential for the film. Pre-sales and incredible fan enthusiasm portend a blockbuster style weekend.”
Expectations are that Swift could tally between $40 million and $60 million on Friday, on her way to an opening weekend draw of as much as $150 million. Any figure over $96 million for the weekend will make it the highest opening film in the month of October, beating out 2019′s “Joker.”
“It’s a wild one to try and project,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “Everything comes down to how much walk-up business she can bring in outside her dedicated fans who already bought tickets weeks ago, on top of the average ticket price.”
Swift’s film is on pace to open in about 3,850 theaters, making it the widest domestic release of a concert film. It is also set to have the highest opening weekend for a concert movie, surpassing Miley Cyrus’ “Best of Both Worlds Concert” from 2008, which snared $31.1 million during its domestic debut, according to data from Comscore.
Should the film top $263 million globally during its limited run in theaters, which many box office analysts expect, it will also become the highest-grossing concert film worldwide, surpassing “Michael Jackson’s This Is It.”
AMC Entertainment, which is distributing the film, reported last week that presales for its theaters had already exceeded $100 million for the full run of Swift’s film.
Aiding Swift’s box office haul are average ticket prices that are more than 40% higher than typical releases this year. Base prices for tickets for standard formats start at $19.89 for adults and $13.13 for kids. The numbers reflect Swift’s birth year and her lucky number, 13. Tickets for premium format screens such as IMAX and Dolby come at a higher cost.
Additionally, cinemas are also expected to get a big bump in concession sales. Specialty popcorn buckets, drinkware and boutique cocktails should grab the attention of moviegoers. Many locations also have plans to set up friendship bracelet-making tables and other in-person events to make the occasion bigger and more memorable than just a trip to the movies."
Michael Sheetz,SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy launches $1 billion asteroid mission for NASA,"[The livestream has ended. A replay is available in the video player above.]
SpaceX’s powerful Falcon Heavy rocket successfully launched on Friday morning, carrying a NASA mission bound for a distant asteroid.
Targeting the asteroid Psyche, the eponymous NASA mission is flying a spacecraft — about the width of a tennis court — on a journey of almost six years and about 2.2 billion miles, arriving at the planetary body in July 2029.
The launch took off at 10:19 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

NASA wants to study the composition of the asteroid, which the agency describes as “an unusual object likely rich in metal.” The Psyche spacecraft is armed with a variety of scientific tools, such as instruments for studying the asteroid’s magnetic field and chemical makeup.
The agency expects to spend about $1.2 billion on the Psyche mission, including the costs of development and operations. Of that total cost, NASA awarded SpaceX a contract of about $131 million to launch the mission.
The mission marks SpaceX’s eighth launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket, the company’s most powerful in operation. It landed the rocket’s pair of side boosters, to recover and reuse them for future launches."
Angelica Peebles,"New RSV protections for infants hit cost, insurance hurdles in U.S. rollout","In this article
Two new immunizations promise to protect babies from respiratory syncytial virus – if people can find them.

Providers are scrambling to offer Pfizer’s
vaccine, Abrysvo, to pregnant patients and Sanofi’s
monoclonal antibody, Beyfortus, to babies. The immunizations, both of which protect infants from complications of RSV, were recently approved and are starting to roll out just as the respiratory virus season gets underway. 
The tight timeline leaves little room to resolve logistical hurdles like insurance coverage, and the steep price for the immunizations is making some providers wary of stocking up without a guarantee they’ll get paid for administering them.
These hurdles threaten to prevent babies from receiving protection this winter and to hinder the launches of both drugs. 
“We want to start protecting babies now,” said Michael Chamberlin, a doctor at Pediatric Associates of Mt. Carmel in Cincinnati, Ohio, adding the provider hasn’t received answers from insurers about whether they’re covering Beyfortus — and at what rate.
“We need this information now, and when we contact insurance companies, we’re just not getting that information,” Chamberlin said.
RSV typically feels like a cold for adults but can be dangerous for newborns, seniors and adults with chronic medical conditions. Complications from the virus are the leading cause of hospitalization among newborns. 
Until now, the only preventative treatment was another monoclonal antibody called Synagis that’s given once a month during RSV season, which generally runs from fall through spring. It costs about $1,000 a dose and is recommended only for babies at high risk for severe illness. 
The two new options work a little differently from one another but are both meant to protect more newborns from RSV. Pfizer’s Abrysvo is a vaccine given during pregnancy to stimulate an immune response that’s then passed onto the fetus. Sanofi’s Beyfortus is a monoclonal antibody that’s given directly to babies and provides them with immediate protection. Both cut the risk of severe disease or hospitalization by more than 50%.
“Whether it’s a neighbor, or a friend, or an older sibling that was hospitalized, everybody knows what [RSV] is,” said Erin Bakke, whose 4-month-old son Graham received a Beyfortus shot this week. “I know that [RSV]’s a threat to little babies, and so to have an opportunity to prevent illness in the first place is really exciting.”
Laura Riley, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian, originally wasn’t planning to administer Abrysvo in her office. The shot carries a list price of $295, making it more expensive than other maternal vaccines like one for whooping cough, for example, that costs about $50.
“It’s not an inexpensive endeavor,” Riley said.
But Riley said she heard from patients struggling to get vaccinated at pharmacies that were already administering the shot to seniors. And once she realized how difficult the process could be, she decided people clearly weren’t going to get vaccinated unless she made it easy for them and offered it right in the office.

Pfizer said any access issues are likely due to the quick turnaround from when Abrysvo was recommended for use during pregnancy. The vaccine was formally recommended for use during pregnancy earlier this month, the final step that some pharmacies and insurers wait for before administering or paying for new shots. Abrysvo was approved for use in people 60 and older in May.
Health insurers have one year from when the CDC’s advisors recommend an immunization to start paying for it. Sanofi said more than 90% of infants are already covered by health plans, and Pfizer said it’s seeing early positive momentum. But insurers acknowledge that people may still face delays as they update their policies. 
“Coverage during the one-year implementation period will vary from plan to plan as system, technical and coding issues may arise,” Kelly Parsons, a spokesperson for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said in a statement.
Pediatricians of Dallas, where Graham Bakke received his Beyfortus shot, bought about 200 doses of the monoclonal antibody to see if insurers would accept the claims before ordering enough for the roughly 1,000 babies it ultimately expects to immunize against RSV this season, said James Watson, a doctor at the office.
Insurers are reimbursing the office, Watson said, albeit at a lower rate than the shot costs. It’s a price the office is willing to pay. 
“It’s the important thing to do,” Watson said. “If we lose a little money, we’ll see you for other things, and that’s just part of the game.”

Jesse Pound,Citigroup reports better-than-expected revenue for the third quarter,"In this article
Citigroup
reported its third-quarter results on Friday morning, with solid growth in both institutional clients and personal banking fueling higher-than-expected revenue and earnings per share.
Here’s what the company announced compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
Revenue and net income rose by 9% and 2%, respectively, year over year.
Citigroup’s institutional clients unit reported $10.6 billion in revenue, up 12% year over year and 2% from the second quarter. The bank said it was the best third quarter in the past decade for rates and currencies revenue.
Meanwhile, the personal banking and wealth management division generated $6.8 billion in revenue, up roughly 10% year over year and 6% from the second quarter.
“Despite the headwinds, our five core, interconnected businesses each posted revenue growth resulting in overall growth of 9%,” CEO Jane Fraser said in a press release.
Despite the better-than-expected results, shares of the bank closed down 0.2% for the day. Citigroup’s stock is now down more than 8% for the year.
Among other banks that reported quarterly results on Friday morning, JPMorgan
and Wells Fargo
both showed stronger-than-expected revenue numbers in their third-quarter reports.
Citigroup reported $1.84 billion in total cost of credit at the end of the quarter, up slightly from $1.82 billion at the end of the second quarter and $1.37 billion a year ago. That metric includes a net build of $125 million in the allowance for credit losses during the third quarter. Analysts were expecting total cost of credit to reach $1.96 billion, according to FactSet’s StreetAccount.
“The global macro backdrop remains a story of desynchronization. In the US, recent data implies a soft-landing, but history would suggest otherwise and we are seeing some cracks in the lower [credit score] consumer. In the euro area and the UK, the picture turned distinctly more negative,” Fraser said on a call with analysts.
Friday’s earnings report includes the period during which Fraser announced the bank would be divided into five main business lines, the latest change for the CEO since taking over in March 2021. Fraser said Friday that the changes should be completed by early 2024 and create financial benefits down the line.
“While expense is not the primary driver of the organizational changes, they will help us start bending the expense curve in the fourth quarter of next year,” Fraser said.
The new structure, announced Sept. 13, is expected to include job cuts. CFO Mark Mason declined to give guidance on head count during Friday’s call.
Citigroup’s net interest margin for the quarter was 2.49%, above the 2.41% expected, according to FactSet’s StreetAccount. Mason said that the company expects its 2023 full-year net interest income to come in slightly above previous guidance.
Another initiative under Fraser has been Citi selling off its retail banking business in some international markets. The latest move on that front came on Oct. 9, when the bank announced that it had struck a deal to sell its onshore consumer wealth portfolio in China. Fraser said Friday that the bank expects to close sale of Indonesia consumer business in the fourth quarter."
