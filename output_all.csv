Brooke DiPalma,"How Lululemon parlayed yoga pants into an entry to the S&P 500
The yogi brand survived several scandals to become an athleisure powerhouse.","Lululemon is finally aligning with Wall Street.The athleisure retail company officially joined the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index on Wednesday, replacing game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI), which recently finalized its merger with Microsoft (MSFT).The Canadian company weathered a series of storms in the mid-2010s but grew out of its yogi-heavy appeal into a cross-generational, multisport brand. In the past year, its stock has risen nearly 40%, while it recently beat estimates on earnings and revenue.Last quarter, its net revenue increased 18% compared to a year ago, while internet sales growth jumped 15%.""From a long-term perspective, this is a sustainable growth story,"" Bernstein senior analyst Aneesha Sherman told Yahoo Finance over the phone.This run-up is a long time coming.The company, which first started making its signature legging in the late 90s, went public back in 2007. By 2013, its share price had roughly quadrupled, as its revenue flew from $275 million to over $1.3 billion. Then, it hit choppy waters.In March 2013, Lululemon recalled 17% of its black yoga pants for being too sheer, which cost it roughly $60 million in lost sales, reported the New York Times. Its CEO Christine Day resigned that June, and later told Fortune she left due to conflicting views with its founder Chip Wilson. Day declined to comment to Yahoo Finance.That November, Wilson went on Bloomberg TV and said issues with his company's leggings was because ""Some women’s bodies don’t work for the pants."" He stepped down from the board a month later amid uproar from customers; Lululemon's share price dropped by roughly a quarter in 2014.Day's successor, Laurent Potdevin, then resigned in 2018, which the company said was due to him falling short of expectations for employees when it comes to integrity and respect. Among the issues was a rumored relationship with a female designer at the company.Amid the noise, Lululemon marched on, pushing more into menswear in 2014 and investing in digital sales. In August 2018, Calvin McDonald took the helm as CEO and carried forward the momentum as the company moved its appeal beyond yoga.Story continues""Since about 2018, it's just been incredibly successful,"" David Swartz, Morningstar senior equity analyst, told Yahoo Finance over the phone. ""It's defied all the pressure on retailers, especially apparel retailers in that time."" In the past few years, Lululemon has been able to ride ""three waves of growth,"" which include e-commerce, athleisure wear booming during COVID lockdowns, and pent-up demand for high-quality casual apparel, Sherman said.Lululemon's digital sales jumped 27% in fiscal year 2017, hitting a peak jumping 101% year over year in fiscal year 2020. More recently, non-athletic wear like belt bags and men's casual pants are gaining momentum, though it's too early to tell if Lululemon can become a universal brand like Nike or Adidas.Last year, Lululemon released its plans to double its 2021 revenue of $6.25 billion to $12.5 billion by 2026. Besides expanding its product lines, the company aims to quadruple its international revenue and make China its No. 2 market. The move can unlock wholesale opportunities in the country as well, said Sherman.It also launched its ""Play"" categories in 2022, which includes apparel for golf, tennis, and hiking.Growth comes with risks, though. Sherman calls the brand's expansion into footwear last year a mistake, as it requires extensive development costs while diluting profit margins. In her eyes, the brand could have pursued other untapped areas like kids. Its $500 million acquisition of fitness startup Mirror in June 2020 also did not pan out.Though the macroeconomic environment is volatile, Lululemon has been able to sell its inventory without taking a discount strategy, McDonald said at Goldman Sachs' Retail Conference earlier this year.It's undeniable, though: People are increasingly looking for deals as inflation remains sticky and savings dwindle.""I don't think they [can] escape [consumers looking for discounts],"" said Sherman, ""but I think it's probably a little bit more defensive because of the higher-income consumer segment.""—Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Ronda Lee,Student loan repayments will have a 'limited' impact on the economy: NY Fed,"Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are predicting that student loan repayments won't pose a huge headwind for the economy based on a small survey of borrowers.The study released Wednesday found that the restart in loan payments would reduce borrowers' spending by $1.6 billion a month, or down 0.1 percentage point from August levels. Delinquency rates would also eventually return to pre-pandemic levels.""We expect the potential spillover to the broader economy to be limited, and we will continue to monitor developments in the coming months,"" the researchers wrote.The findings come as retailers, borrower advocates, and others worry about the potential ramifications of repayments after a 43-month pause.Read more: Worried about student loan repayments resuming? These programs could help (Credit: Federal Reserve Bank of New York)They also expect President Joe Biden’s new income-driven repayment plan will reduce monthly payments and waive unpaid interest for low-income student loan borrowers. The study estimated that 58% of borrowers will be enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan after the pause, compared with 50% pre-pandemic.Read more: How to apply for IDR forgivenessStill, there are headwinds on that front.To date, the majority of borrowers enrolled in the president's new plan are those that were automatically transferred from an older repayment plan. New enrollees to the new plan are relatively low. Additionally, borrowers have experienced problems trying to enroll in SAVE and reach out to loan servicers.Recently, a Student Debt Crisis Center surveyed found only 20% of respondents feel they have the information they need to prepare for the resumption of payments, and 27.5% have not received any recent communication from their loan servicer.""I know firsthand that the information borrowers receive from their loan servicers is sporadic at best and not always wholly accurate,"" said Sabrina Calazans, managing director of the SDCC, in a press statement. ""We hear from borrowers daily who are struggling to not only navigate the system, but to even know where to start.""Ronda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Finance and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.

Alexandra Canal,Netflix subscribers surge as company announces price hikes in some regions,"Netflix (NFLX) reported a surge in third quarter subscriber numbers of nearly 9 million and announced it will be raising prices in the US, UK, and France, sending its stock higher in after-hours trading Wednesday.Beginning Wednesday, Netflix said its Basic and Premium plans will now cost $11.99 and $22.99, respectively, in the US. That's up from the prior $9.99 and $19.99 price points. Netflix’s $6.99 ad-supported plan and $15.49 Standard plan will stay the same price.""Our starting price is extremely competitive with other streamers and at $6.99 per month in the US, for example, it’s much less than the average price of a single movie ticket,"" the company said in its quarterly release. The last time Netflix raised prices was in March 2022.The stock surged in after-hours trading as a result, up more than as 12%.Revenue slightly beat the company's guidance of $8.52 billion to hit $8.54 billion in the quarter, an increase of nearly 8% compared to the same period last year, as the streamer leans on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing, which rolled out in the US in late May, along with its ad-supported offering.Netflix guided to fourth quarter revenue of $8.69 billion, slightly below consensus expectations of $8.76 billion.Earnings per share (EPS) also beat estimates in the quarter with the company reporting EPS of $3.73, ahead of consensus expectations of $3.49. The company reported EPS of $3.10 in the year-ago period.On the advertising front, Netflix said the adoption of its ads plan continues to grow with membership up almost 70% quarter over quarter with 30% of users signing up to the ad tier in the countries where it's available. The company said there's still ""more work to do to scale this business.""Netflix added 8.8 million new subscribers in the quarter, handily beating expectations of 6.2 million. The company said the higher-than-expected growth was ""due to the roll out of paid sharing, strong, steady programming and the ongoing expansion of streaming globally."" The company had added just 2.41 million paying users in Q3 2022.Story continuesNetflix said it expects fourth quarter subscriber net additions ""to be similar"" to the third quarter's results.Still, despite the surge in paying users, the company was unable to boost average revenue per membership, or ARM.ARM decreased 1% year over year, in line with the company's expectations. Netflix blamed the decline on a number of factors, ""including a higher percentage of membership growth from lower ARM countries, limited price increases over the past 18 months, and some shift in plan mix.""

FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)Profitability metrics like operating margin and free cash flow, however, steadily beat expectations.Operating margin hit 22.4% in the quarter, surpassing Netflix's own projection of 22.2%. The company said it expects full-year operating margins to hit 20% — the high end of its previous forecast between 18% and 20%.Free cash flow impressed at $1.89 billion, above consensus calls of $1.27 billion. Netflix boosted its full-year free cash flow guidance to $6.5 billion, up from the prior $5 billion, citing the impact of the double Hollywood strikes.""The last six months have been challenging for our industry given the combined writers and actors strikes in the US,"" the company said in its release. ""While we have reached an agreement with the WGA, negotiations with SAG-AFTRA are ongoing. We’re committed to resolving the remaining issues as quickly as possible so everyone can return to work making movies and TV shows that audiences will love.""As Hollywood productions remain shut down amid the actors strike, the company said it expects to spend around $13 billion on content this year before boosting that number to $17 billion next year, assuming the SAG strike is resolved in the near future.In the meantime, the platform will lean on new programming — such as live events.Earlier this week, the company confirmed the debut of “The Netflix Cup,” a celebrity golf tournament that will feature athletes from ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive"" and “Full Swing.” The event will stream live from Wynn Gold Club in Las Vegas on Nov.14.Outside of content investments, the company said in its shareholder letter that it will plan on ""substantial changes for 2024"" to its executive compensation plan after shareholders rejected a multi-million dollar executive compensation package earlier this summer.The company spent an estimated $166 million on its executive pay package last year.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Pras Subramanian,Tesla earnings: Q3 revenue and profit miss estimates; Cybertruck deliveries to begin in November,"Tesla (TSLA) stock was volatile in after-hours trading after the electric vehicle maker missed on both the top and bottom lines, though the company did reveal that Cybertruck deliveries are on track for November 30th of this year.For the quarter, Tesla reported top-line revenue of $23.4 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $24.06 billion, however revenue did climb 13% from a year ago. From a profitability standpoint, Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.66 versus $0.74 expected and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion versus the $2.56 billion expected, which is nearly 37% lower than a year ago.The drop in profitability could be attributed to expected downward pressure on margins since Tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late last year. Tesla reported Q3 gross margin of 17.9%, slightly missing Wall Street estimates of 18.0%. Last quarter Tesla reported gross margin of 18.2%.Tesla, however, did reiterate its 2023 production goal of 1.8 million vehicles. Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 435,059 vehicles globally, of which approximately 419,000 were Model Y and Model 3 vehicles and around 16,000 were higher-priced Model X and Model S cars. Wall Street consensus estimates had deliveries pegged at 456,722. From Tesla's Q3 2023 shareholder deck. (Tesla)This story is developing. Check back for updates.

Ben Werschkul,Calls to empower Patrick McHenry get louder as Republicans again fail to pick a speaker,"Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) fell short for a second time in his quest for the speaker’s gavel Wednesday, with more of his GOP colleagues voting against him today than yesterday. The resilient opposition to his hardline candidacy is fueling new calls for a stopgap maneuver to get the House operational again.The idea that has been put forth by both Democrats and Republicans in recent days would empower Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) with new powers. He currently oversees the chamber as speaker pro tempore but operates with restricted powers.For now, McHenry only has the authority to convene a vote for the next full speaker but growing his powers could at least temporarily allay some fears on Wall Street and in the business world about the seemingly endless dysfunction on Capitol Hill. The extent and duration of McHenry’s possible powers could also be a point of contention if the idea advances further.The various comments in support of the idea differ on significant details, such as whether McHenry should be empowered until a certain date or indefinitely.Also up for debate is whether he would be able to address any issue that arises or focus only on certain circumscribed ideas like a government shutdown and foreign aid. There is also an open question about whether an empowered speaker pro tempore would be in the presidential line of succession.Finally, McHenry himself is also a wild card. He has repeatedly downplayed the idea in comments to reporters on Capitol Hill.McHenry is also a close ally of Kevin McCarthy, who selected him for his current position atop the House, but has avoided calls to join the House leadership on a permanent basis for years, preferring instead to serve as chair of the Financial Services Committee.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo

David Hollerith,Morgan Stanley's profit drops on Wall Street slowdown,"Third quarter profits at Morgan Stanley (MS) dropped 9% from a year ago as revenue from investment banking and trading fell, another sign that Wall Street is still struggling to recover from a prolonged slump.Investors signaled their disappointment, sending the firm's stock down roughly 7% Wednesday. That was its largest single-day drop in more than three years. In the last three months, the stock is down 13%, a steeper decline than all its big-bank peers.Morgan Stanley's third quarter earnings result also ranked near the bottom of the big banks. Its drop in profit was smaller than the 33% decline at rival Goldman Sachs (GS) but it trailed profit jumps reported by JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C). ""While the market environment remained mixed this quarter, the firm delivered solid results,"" said CEO James Gorman, who in May announced plans to step down as leader ""at some point in the next 12 months.""Gorman told analysts that he expects more activity to materialize in 2024. At the moment, Gorman said on a Wednesday morning conference call, ""boards of directors are sitting there saying, until we understand the cost of financing, it is very difficult to pull the trigger on some of these capital transactions.""But when the Federal Reserve decides it has stopped raising interest rates, ""the M&A and underwriting calendar will explode because there is enormous pent-up activity.""Story continues""I don't know if it's six months out or nine months out or it starts three months out, but this thing is going to start turning and then rates will be the kick when they start coming down.""""Unfortunately I’m not going to be around to enjoy it,"" he added.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo
Julie Hyman,Why you shouldn't listen to Jamie Dimon,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsEarlier in the week, Jamie Dimon got our attention by calling this perhaps “the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.”And that may be true, from a geopolitical perspective. Wars are now raging in both Ukraine and Israel, with broader implications. Dimon also pointed to the risks of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program at a time when inflation is persisting.As my colleague Brian Sozzi wrote this week, when one of the most powerful CEOs in the world makes a dramatic comment like that, you take notice.But in markets, it’s always a good idea to think about how someone may be talking his book.“For Jamie Dimon — for a bank that has strongly outperformed its peers, it’s a matter really of trying to lower expectations,” Ken Leon, a veteran bank analyst at CFRA, told Yahoo Finance Live. “That’s always his mission, to lower the bar, because it’s the one bank every quarter that outperforms and delivers across all the lines of business.” (JPM happens to be one of Leon’s top picks).And if you tune Dimon out, there are quite a few reassuring signals.Take Tuesday’s retail sales report, which came in double economists’ estimates. While it could put pressure on the Fed to raise rates once again, central bank officials have presented a remarkably consistent message over the past couple of weeks: They are willing to be patient, and higher Treasury yields are helping tighten financial conditions without them having to further raise rates at this time.Spurred by that retail sales data, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast now stands at 5.4% annualized growth for the third quarter. The S&P 500 has bounced back by more than 3% since early October. Early earnings from the big banks and the likes of Johnson & Johnson have beat estimates.Story continuesBank of America’s weekly fund flows data showed an 11th straight week of inflows into equities, with buyers favoring cyclicals over defensives — implying optimism about economic growth.Maybe investors should pay attention to what Dimon said after his warning: “While we hope for the best, we prepare the Firm for a broad range of outcomes so we can consistently deliver for clients no matter the environment.”In other words, while there appear to be positive signs for the economy and markets, it never hurts to be prepared for anything. morning brief imageClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo
Josh Schafer,Goldman: 15 million Americans will be taking weight loss drugs by 2030,"Predictions for the size of the market for prescription weight loss drugs keep growing.New research from Goldman Sachs projects 15 million adults in the US will be on anti-obesity medications by 2030, representing 13% penetration in the US adult population — not including diabetic patients.Globally, Goldman Sachs sees sales for chronic weight management reaching $100 billion by 2030, up from a $6 billion annualized estimate earlier this year.""The chronic weight management market is undergoing an inflection, in our view, with potential for solid growth ahead and a peak opportunity that, by our estimates, could ultimately yield some of the highest grossing drugs of all time,"" a team of Goldman Sachs analysts led by Chris Shibutani wrote in a research note on Monday.Recent buzz about the impact of the weight loss drugs has caught the attention of Wall Street. Several analysts have questioned whether drugs like Ozempic could hamper demand for fast food and food sales at retailers like Walmart (WMT), which has said the drug was leading to lower revenue.The excitement has driven stock gains for prescription drugs producers Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lily (LLY). Last week, Novo Nordisk raised its full-year sales guidance on a better-than-expected sales outlook from its diabetes drug, Ozempic. The drug isn't approved directly for weight loss, but it's still become a popular use for the drug. Meanwhile during its most recent quarterly earnings report in August, Eli Lily raised its own sales guidance on increased demand for its Type 2 diabetes management drug, Mounjaro.Part of Goldman Sachs's prediction of a $100 billion weight loss drug market reflects the growing number of obese people worldwide. Goldman Sachs cites World Health Organization data noting that obesity has nearly tripled worldwide since 1975. They also highlight the World Obesity Atlas, which expects over half of the global population will be overweight or obese by 2035.Story continuesOne of the key headwinds to wider adoption will be government approval. Novo Nordisk's Wegovy has been approved specifically for weight loss, but Eli Lily's drug is still in the process. Goldman estimates that Eli Lily's Tirzepatide product, which is still awaiting approval, will account for more than one-third of the prescription weight loss market by 2030.Additionally, insurance coverage and how long patients will use the drug still remain up in the air.Goldman projects 90% of employers will provide insurance coverage for anti-obesity medications by 2030, while the trajectory for how long patients take the drug remains a ""key unknown."" Some studies, like one from UCHealth, have shown patients will take the drugs indefinitely. But Goldman wasn't that extreme.""We believe a reasonable assumption at this juncture is to assume a duration of 12 months on average, recognizing that introduction of orals and novel mechanisms will likely influence how long patients remain on AOMs,"" Goldman's team of analysts wrote.The market could get even bigger, too.""Meaningful uptake in pediatric-age ... individuals would represent upside to our estimates,"" Goldman Sachs said.

Ines Ferré,Gas prices are falling even with oil nearing $90 a barrel — here's why,"US crude oil futures have risen about 5% since the Israel-Hamas war started earlier this month, but that jump hasn't stopped the downward trend in gasoline prices.The national average cost of retail gasoline sits at $3.58 per gallon, $0.10 less than a week ago, and $0.30 off from last month, according to AAA data. Even California, which has the highest average in the nation at $5.59 per gallon, has seen a $0.17 decline from exactly one week ago.""Gas prices seasonally fall every autumn,"" Andrew Gross, spokesperson for AAA, told Yahoo Finance. ""2023 is no exception.""The main reasons behind the fall decline is the switch to a less expensive winter blend driving fuel and lower seasonal demand.""Gas prices will likely keep dropping until the end of the year,"" Gross said. ""The one caveat would be if the new war expands to include oil-producing nations in the region.""Inventories roughly 10% higher than this time one year ago are also pressuring gasoline prices. A customer fills up at a gas station in Plains, Pa., Oct. 19, 2022. REUTERS/Aimee DilgerCrude oil prices spiked last week amid fears the Israel-Hamas war could broaden to other countries — namely Iran — a key global oil producer.Despite last week's gains, prices are still roughly 7% below their 2023 high reached on Sept. 28.""Fundamentally...the crude market remains very healthy,"" Rebecca Babin, CIBC Private Wealth energy trader, told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday. ""We are in a place where supply and demand are very closely balanced, if not in a slight deficit.""Oil surged in the third quarter of this year amid continued OPEC+ production cuts and unilateral reductions by Saudi Arabia, which are expected to continue through year-end.""A lot of the view [on oil prices] hinges on what [OPEC+ does] next. I think they stand pat, and we continue to see crude trade really well supported in that low-$80s range,"" Babin said.""[If] we get into the $90s we do start to worry about demand destruction, which I think is a very real thing.""Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Karen Friar and Alexandra Canal,Stocks close mostly flat after hot retail sales report: Stock market news today,"Stocks closed mostly flat on Tuesday after retail sales data smashed expectations and earnings season picked up steam.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flatline while contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) closed down 0.25%.The 10-year Treasury yield soared more than 13 basis points to trade around 4.85%, the most since July 27. The 10-year yield hit a 16-year high of 4.89% on Oct. 6.Retail sales rose 0.7% in September from the previous month, more than double Wall Street's estimates for 0.3% growth, the latest data out Tuesday showed.

Ben Werschkul,"Two long-shot options to restart the House if Jim Jordan isn’t elected speaker
Jim Jordan's bid to become the leader of the House of Representatives fell short on his first ballot Tuesday.","Republicans fell short yet again in their effort to agree on a next speaker of the House as Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) didn't have the votes on his first ballot before the full House of Representatives.Twenty Republican lawmakers voted against their colleague for the gavel, higher than many Jordan allies had expected, dooming his bid at least on Tuesday afternoon's first ballot.Jordan is set to push for more votes, telling reporters on the way into the chamber ""whatever it takes to get a speaker today."" But he could face a difficult challenge in the hours and days ahead in changing the minds of his opponents while also holding his own fragile coalition together.In his own quest for job earlier this year, Kevin McCarthy saw 19 Republicans vote against him on the first ballot before he eventually prevailed following 15 grueling rounds of voting.The latest round of GOP dysfunction is sure to renew the focus on various long-shot options that have been circulating for days as ways to eventually restart the paralyzed lower chamber and address pressing issues such as aid for Israel and a government shutdown deadline in just one month's time. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) is the current temporary leader of the House. (Alex Brandon/AP Photo)""We strongly support an immediate vote to expand the speaker pro tempore's authorities to allow for the consideration of a legislative agenda limited to the most pressing issues,"" wrote four moderate Democratic lawmakers in a recent letter even as McHenry himself has often repeatedly batted away the suggestion.Indeed, empowering McHenry appears to be more popular with Democrats than with Republicans at the moment. Some on the far right — notably Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) — have been criticizing McHenry for even how he’s exercised his limited powers. But the maneuver could see increasing moderate support if the stalemate continues.""My opinion is that the longer this drags on, the more authority the speaker pro tempore will be authorized,"" says Henrietta Treyz, Veda Partners managing partner and director of economic policy research, in a recent interview.It's ""maybe the path of least resistance at this point,"" she added.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo
Josh Schafer,Resilient consumer keeps pressure on Fed,"A hot jobs market is continuing to help boost consumer spending.Retail sales rose 0.7% in September from the previous month, more than double Wall Street's estimates for 0.3% growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department released on Tuesday. Retail sales have now grown from the month prior for six straight months, marking a consistent trend of consumer spending.This, economists say, has been supported by an average of nearly 270,000 nonfarm payroll additions over the same period. With no clear signs of the labor market fully cooling, the strong position of the US consumer entering the fourth quarter of 2023 could provide upside risks to inflation that's already showing signs of stickiness — and prompt more Fed rate hikes.""The economy is entering Q4 with more momentum than we previously thought,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ""The risks to our forecast for a slight contraction in consumption in Q4 are firmly to the upside.

Earnings at Goldman were up 69% when compared to the second quarter, a period when Goldman reported its lowest quarterly profits since early 2020. Its investment banking fees of $1.5 billion were up 9% from the second quarter and up 1% from a year ago.Goldman helped a number of prominent companies, including Arm (ARM) and Instacart (CART), go public in the second quarter.Fixed-income trading revenues were also up 25% from the second quarter although down 6% from a year ago.

Reuters,Goldman Sachs lifts Europe Inc's 2023 profit growth forecast to 3%,"Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it expects earnings for companies in the pan-European STOXX 600 index to grow 3% in 2023, compared with its prior projection of no growth, on the back of higher oil prices.Benchmark Brent crude futures have risen 6% since the conflict in the Middle East began earlier this month, and trade around $89 a barrel. Analysts at the brokerage expect Brent to end the year at $88 a barrel.According to Goldman Sachs, higher oil prices will feed into higher revenues, benefiting commodity-related sectors — for which analysts at the brokerage expect positive earnings upgrades.Shares of European oil majors BP, Shell and TotalEnergies have gained between 4.5% and 7% since the conflict began. [O/R]Europe's oil and gas sector hit nine-year highs on Monday, and leapt almost 7% since Oct. 6. The sector is up 8.3% so far this year, ahead of the STOXX 600's 6% gain during the period.Adjusting for inflation, however, Goldman Sachs expects earnings in Europe to fall 2% this year. Cost of debt due to rising bond yields also poses a threat to profits, it said. [GVD/EUR]""We estimate that a 100-basis-point rise in the cost of debt would knock 3 percentage points off (STOXX 600's) EPS (earnings per share),"" said Lilia Peytavin, portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs.For the next year, Goldman Sachs forecasts earnings growth of 7%, versus 5% estimated previously, on anticipation of oil prices hitting $100 per barrel by end-2024.Through 2025, Goldman expects European and U.S. companies' profits to grow at 5% annually from current levels, but only 2% in real terms for Europe in the same period.(Reporting by Roshan Abraham and Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",Yahoo

Josh Schafer,Earnings season off to strong start despite 'uncertain macro' environment ahead,"The predictions for an end to the earnings recession have passed their first test.Of the 32 S&P 500 companies that have so far reported earnings, they are beating Wall Street's expectations by an average of 9% on earnings per share, according to Bank of America Research's equity strategy team. In aggregate, after two quarters of declines, EPS for S&P 500 companies is up 1% compared to the same quarter last year in a sign that corporate America's earnings recession may be over.In a research note Monday, RBC Capital's head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina described the start of earnings season as ""solid"" despite ""macro headwinds.""And, importantly, despite challenges such as sticky inflation and a higher for longer stance from the Federal Reserve, RBC raised its S&P 500 EPS forecast. RBC's latest accounting for recent macro movements pushed their projections higher, with S&P 500 earnings up to $223 (from $220) in 2023 and $232 (from $229) in 2024.But while the estimate boost for Q3 earnings could imply a more glossy outlook for the index, Calvasina's S&P 500 price target for 2023 remains unchanged at 4,250, as the strategists note S&P 500 EPS is just one of several things that drive their calls.When zooming out beyond just earnings, Calvasina still finds the macro picture to be choppy.""Our review of S&P 500 earnings call transcripts since late September suggests the macro is taking a toll,"" Calvasina wrote. ""Companies continue to emphasize the resiliency of a consumer who has become more selective in their spending. We are also reading about how macro uncertainty, including inflation and interest rate policy, are impacting demand and spending, though this is more on the corporate side. Pricing commentary remains mixed, with a fair amount of emphasis on how it’s moderating.""Throughout the early part of earnings season, though, the numbers companies report are appearing to drive stock action rather than the headwinds they may be commenting on.Story continuesPerhaps no earnings release was a clearer example of this than JPMorgan's (JPM). The head of America's leading financial institution had a grim view on the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" JPMorgan chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in the company's earnings release.But despite the characterization, JPMorgan investors seemed more focused on another blowout quarter for profits as the stock rose more than 1.5% on Friday.The same could be said for the S&P 500, which is up nearly 1% since Pepsi reported strong results on Oct. 10.

Brian Sozzi,Why you should carefully consider what Jamie Dimon just told the investing world,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsI was sitting in a Washington, D.C., hotel room for the start of bank earnings last Friday morning, a.k.a. the official beginning of earnings season.I had my normal earnings day routine in full effect: Three large iced coffees nearby, a digital notebook, a pair of headphones, soft-to-the-touch Lululemon clothing, and a story template open and ready to rock.There were three things I wanted to learn from the big banks: 1) charge-off trends (we cover a lot of retail names here at Yahoo Finance), 2) the state of the deal market, and 3) commentary around Wall Street hiring trends.I proceeded to open up the JPMorgan earnings release. Per usual, I combed through the numbers along the left rail of the first page. Then, per usual, I focused on the box on the bottom right of the page for the latest commentary from its CEO Jamie Dimon.This comment from Dimon immediately popped out: ""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.""""Wow, that is pretty intense from Jamie,"" I said to myself. ""Never heard that tone from him before — what does it mean to the average investor?""With that comment right there from Dimon, the complexion of this earnings season has dramatically changed. The approach to investing in the market has changed into year-end, I think.One sentence by the most powerful CEO in the game today. And when he says something like that it warrants a new way of thinking by investors.Dimon followed up on this thread on the earnings call: ""My caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there, you just got to be very cautious."" He added he is concerned about government debt levels and inflation, two topics he has focused on in various venues in recent months.Story continuesYou may be asking yourself why, several days later, I am still harping on these comments.Here's why.The most powerful CEO in the world with the biggest network and the best information is using all of that to put forth guidance to his various stakeholders and followers. Dimon in no way takes making a statement like that lightly. He knows the gravity of his words.But then, in reality, Dimon is quite correct in his assessment.The Israel-Hamas war continues to play out on a grand stage worldwide, injecting fresh geopolitical uncertainties. The Ukraine-Russia war rages. All of this has ties back to China and resurfaces our contentious relationship with that country.The US House of Representatives is a flat-out mess that is making the country look bad again.‌There is still a chance of a mid-November government shutdown. Inflation is stubborn and rate hikes continue to permeate the economy. Government debt levels are crazy and getting crazier.Now if you follow the Warren Buffett style of investing, then none of this stuff matters. You buy stocks deemed attractively valued and shuffle along for the next 75 years drinking Coca-Cola.Not everyone subscribes to that approach, though, and many are trying to live for today by investing in the markets or other assets. To that end, it feels appropriate to have more caution on asset allocation in the near term until some of the aforementioned issues cool down. Besides, stock valuations aren't exactly cheap.‌It often pays to listen to smart people in investing, and Dimon is obviously one of the smartest people in the room.‌In case you were wondering, I got my charge-off answer.On JPM's media call, CFO Jeremy Barnum (another smart exec) told me he isn't seeing ""acute pain"" in consumers from higher interest rates. It was a fair response but I think one that suggests those retailers we follow here at Yahoo Finance will report tepid third quarter results.‌Hey, I am pretty smart, too. morning brief imageBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Seana Smith,"'Fog on the horizon': CEOs brace for recession
A soft landing looks elusive as geopolitical risk raises bets of a recession.","Wall Street’s great debate of 2023 — whether the US economy is headed for a recession — is resurfacing amid escalating unrest in the Middle East.Heightened geopolitical risk, along with unabating inflationary pressures, surging bond yields, and the Federal Reserve’s ""higher for longer"" vision, has business leaders bracing for a contraction.“There’s a lot of fog on the horizon,” KPMG US CEO Paul Knopp told Yahoo Finance Live, citing geopolitical tensions as one of the top risks to the economy.Seventy-two percent of CEOs are preparing for a US recession over the next 12-18 months, according to The Conference Board’s survey of business leaders. While that’s an improvement from the start of the year, expectations about the short-term economic outlook have darkened.Big bank CEOs are among those weighing in on a more uncertain economic outlook. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon pointed to a number of potential risks, including a sober warning on geopolitical crises abroad. Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser noted “an increasingly cautious consumer” in the bank’s earnings release Friday.

Dylan Croll,Younger adults are upbeat about their financial future even though many are struggling,"Young adults are surprisingly optimistic about their own financial futures despite crushing inflation and lingering fears of recession.A new study found that 80% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 are struggling or merely surviving financially. But the vast majority — 72% — believe they'll be thriving in five years and 79% expect to get there in 30 years, according to the study from Edward Jones and MIT’s AgeLab Next360, which polled 2,003 adults in that age group.The study offers insight into what this cohort wants from their lives as they age, and reveals how personal finance advice could help them overcome the challenges they face in getting there.""While some feel like they're just surviving, maybe barely keeping their head above water, they must feel deep down, 'I just need a few years.

""And at least, if nothing else, understand the trade off you're making so that you're making an informed choice.

Ronda Lee,Student loan borrowers will get a hand in saving for retirement next year,"A new federal rule next year will make it easier for borrowers paying back their student loans to also save for their retirement.Section 110 of the SECURE 2.0 Act, legislation signed into law last December, will allow employers to provide 401(k), 403(b), or SIMPLE IRA matching for qualified student loan payments. The provision is optional and effective January 2024.This change helps to address a longstanding challenge for most borrowers: paying back student debt prevents them from saving for other goals, a problem that has resurfaced now that federal loan payments are no longer on pause. Additionally, this provision can benefit employers as far as retention, reducing attrition, and recruiting new talent.""It’s impossible to ignore the long-term financial impact student loan repayments can have on employees across all generations,"" Eric Stevenson, president of Nationwide Retirement Solutions, said in a statement. ""The good news is SECURE 2.0 Act now allows employers to provide matching retirement plan contributions based on the amount of an employee’s student debt repayments — a provision Nationwide advocated for and is excited to further innovate on.""Read more: Should you refinance your student loans?

Meanwhile, Tesla and Netflix will highlight the start of tech earnings.A September retail sales report is expected to show minor growth amid an otherwise quiet week for economic data.Recent economic data showed inflation cooling enough for the market to bet that the Fed won't raise interest rates at its November meeting but stocks still struggled to find solid footing as rising geopolitical risks and the fallout from higher for longer interest rates continue to cloud the picture.In the past week, the Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell nearly 0.2% while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.8%.Inflation data out last week showed cooling price increases under the surface. The data left markets optimistic on a rate pause in November as Fed officials expressed that higher yields could provide necessary monetary tightening and effectively take the place of another interest rate hike.But combined with a hot September jobs report, there isn't a broad consensus that the Fed is done hiking altogether.""Continued strength in the labor market could lead to persistence in wage growth and forestall declines in consumption growth, which would leave price pressures elevated and growth above trend,"" Oxford Economics' team of economists wrote in a research note on Thursday.

David Hollerith,Big banks are benefiting from higher rates. Their customers aren't.,"Higher interest rates are lifting the fortunes of the nation’s biggest banks. They aren’t doing the same for the banks’ customers.Earnings for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) all rose in the third quarter largely because high rates allowed them to rake in more interest income.Their scale allows them to leverage those rates by charging more for loans while holding down how much more they pay for deposits when compared to smaller rivals.These advantages show up in a key profitability metric known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks make on their loans and pay for their deposits.That number was up by sizable amounts at all three banks when compared to the same period a year ago. Together the lenders pulled in a record $50 billion, 18% more than the same period last year. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo even lifted their guidance for how much net interest income they would earn for the full year.Yet there were also clear signs that some of their borrowers are starting to struggle. JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all increased the amount of loans they wrote off as losses. The combined charge-offs at those three banks totaled $3.98 billion, up 31% from the previous quarter and 105% from the same period a year ago.The total was the highest amount collectively for the three lenders since the early days of the pandemic, in the second quarter of 2020.At Citigroup, CEO Jane Fraser warned that US consumers were cutting back. “Continued deceleration in spending indicates an increasingly cautious consumer,” she said in a release.Affluent customers, she added, are accounting for almost all of the spending growth and weakness is showing among those with lower credit scores. Citi expects its credit card losses to reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS)Dimon, S&P Global Market Intelligence director for financial institutions research Nathan Stovall told Yahoo Finance on Friday, was “trying to throw out some caution.”The bank, he added, knows credit costs are going to go up. “They are trying to prepare the Street that you could see tougher times ahead.”One regional bank, PNC (PNC), demonstrated the problems that smaller lenders have navigating this period of higher rates. Its profits and revenue fell from a year ago, as did its net interest income. It expects net interest income to fall again in the fourth quarter when compared to the third.The Pittsburgh bank said it would reduce its staff by roughly 4%, saving $325 million. Several other regional banks, including Truist (TFC), have also eliminated jobs in recent months as they adjust to more uncertain economic conditions.PNC’s stock fell 3% Friday while Citigroup's stock sold off slightly in the later part of the day. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both rose.""The inflection point,"" PNC CEO William Demchak said in response to a question about whether PNC's net interest income had reached a trough, ""I think is entirely dependent on what happens with the Fed in the coming year.""Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo
Irina Ivanova,The labor shortage is here for one reason—and it’s quiet quitting,"One question has hovered over the post-pandemic economy for the better part of three years: Where are all the workers? Businesses’ difficulty hiring has been blamed on a gamut of ills: Too-generous unemployment benefits; too many stimulus checks; not enough immigration; too many workers with long COVID, and, finally, simple laziness.Now, a recent study suggests a different answer: Workers are still there—they’re just not working as hard.Three researchers at Washington University in St. Louis crunched federal data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey and found that most of the drop in hours worked came from people who stayed employed, but worked fewer hours. Their results were published recently in a working paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.“It’s not that fewer people are willing to work—if anything, more people are willing to work than before the pandemic,” co-author Yongseok Shin, a Washington University professor, told Fortune. “But it’s that some people are cutting back their hours.”View this interactive chart on Fortune.comShin and his co-authors, PhD candidates Dain Lee and Jinhyeok Park, found that 55% of the drop in labor supply since the pandemic was due to a decline in hours, while the rest came from people dropping out of the labor force. And it’s not early retirees who are cutting back, either: Most of the reduction came from highly educated men working intensive jobs of 50 hours a week or more, Shin said.“It’s actually young people, 25 to 45, who used to work very long hours, who are now cutting back,” he said, noting, “it’s all men—not women.”Quiet quitting and “no-work Fridays” The data helps explain why, even with the labor participation rate near its pre-pandemic level, job openings remain near record highs and hundreds of thousands more jobs are created every month. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is at a mere 3.8%, a rate that was considered unbelievably low a few short years ago.Story continuesShin believes the pandemic, which pushed millions of Americans to reevaluate what was important to them in life, also set off an epidemic of “quiet quitting,” perhaps better described as salaried workers declining to work excessive hours or hustle quite so much.“Everyone reevaluated their work-life balance, and maybe they said, ‘I don’t have to work 55 hours, I’d like to spend more time with family,’” Shin said.In other words, “quiet quitting,” which has previously been blamed for costing the global economy billions, has also successfully supported the tightest job market in a generation and an increasingly emboldened workforce.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comCrucially, while many of these quiet quitters may have wished for less work pre-pandemic, the advent of hybrid or remote work in white-collar fields has given them the leeway to make it a reality. Even in some offices that are calling back their workforces, “no-work Fridays” have become a phenomenon, with empty offices, few meetings and significantly fewer emails—something Shin said he’s seen among his own friends.“That’s the technological dimension that allows [workers] to do this,” Shin said. “Say you’ve done all your work for Friday in the morning, and you know your colleagues are not in front of the computer either — this allows people to shift back a little bit and not work when the work is not there.”Less frequently, the cutback in work comes from above—as when Shopify earlier this year eliminated unnecessary meetings from its workers’ calendars. “No one schedules meetings for a Friday afternoon, or hardly any Friday at all. We all agree, ‘Let’s get everything done by early afternoon,’” one worker at an advertising agency told the lifestyle publication InsideHook.Plenty of corporations are now trying to claw back some of their workers’ newfound free time, whether it’s mandating three days a week in the office, rewarding workers who put in more face time, or simply telling adamant remote workers they can go elsewhere, as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy memorably did this summer.But if the “new normal” is hybrid work, Shin is hopeful that white-collar employees won’t go back to their overworked ways.He doesn’t see the trend as shirking, but as a realignment of people’s workdays with the vagaries of knowledge jobs. “Sometimes you’re just sitting in your office for no obvious reason — it’s not like a production line, where the workflow is constant,” he said.Indeed, “quiet quitting” is a good thing for all parties involved, Shin argued, since it brings famously overworked American professionals more closely in line with their peers in Europe and other developed nations who take longer vacations and work fewer hours than Americans. It’s good for the employer, too, since workers who aren’t burned out can work later in life, if they want to.While Shin’s study only goes through 2022, data from this year shows the trend is sticking, he said. The share of Americans who are working has exceeded its pre-pandemic high, but the number of hours worked per person hasn’t budged.“It seems like this is a collective decision,” he said. “People seem to like it. If this is the new normal, hopefully it can stay.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo
Brooke DiPalma,"Chipotle's growth prospects remain strong, even with higher menu prices
Consumers still see Chipotle as a value play over its fast-casual peers.","That chicken burrito with guacamole is soon going to cost a little extra, but that isn't likely to deter loyal Chipotle fans.After announcing a pause earlier this year, the global burrito chain plans to raise prices again for the fourth time in two years. Its chief corporate affairs officer Laurie Schalow said in a statement to Yahoo Finance that the company is making the increase to offset inflation.While the company hasn't said when or how much prices will increase, many on the street speculate it will be roughly a 3%-3.5% increase in the middle of Q4 when an updated menu typically comes out.This comes as commodity prices are sticky, with ""ongoing pressure"" around the price of avocados, beef, and chicken, Citi Analyst Jon Tower said on a phone call with Yahoo Finance.He said another factor could be to get ahead of California's Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act, known as the FAST Act, which moves the minimum wage up to $20, effective April 1, 2024.Though the move may put a sour taste in consumers' mouths, they'll still show up. Four growth pillars for Chipotle, based on analyst commentary and Q2 results. (Graphic created by Yahoo Finance)During Q2, digital sales made up 38% of Chipotle's total food and beverage revenue. Of the 47 new restaurants it opened, 40 locations included a Chipotlane.Story continuesThis year, the company plans to open 255 to 285 new restaurants, and 10-15 existing locations will add a Chipotlane, which Charles said tends to have a higher digital and sales mix, calling it a ""win-win-win.""Is now the time to buy into Chipotle? Perhaps.In the past month, shares of Chipotle are down nearly 8% as it closed at $1,781.48 on Friday. In the last five years, its shares are up more than 300%.Tower, who has a buy rating, recently lowered his price target to $2,260 from $2,391. Both the S&P 500 and restaurant foot traffic were flying high in the summer, but they have since moderated, he said.In September and early October, foot traffic at Chipotles increased, but at a lower rate, according to Citi Research, which cites data from Placer.ai. For example, during the week ending July 16, foot traffic jumped 12.3% compared to a year ago, but in the last week of September, that increase was 3.9%.Though Chipotle trades at a premium compared to its peers, Tower said the current price is still a very attractive entry point, given the company's history of gaining additional market share.The company has also been investing in expansion. In North America, it has set a long-term target of 7,000 restaurants. As of the end of Q2, there were more than 3,200. In July, Chipotle announced its first-ever development agreement to open locations in the Middle East and accelerate its international efforts early next year. The ""long-term possibilities"" are there, Tower said, especially when it comes to new stores. It is on the ""precipice"" of expanding its presence, which will create increasing value over time.Throughput — how fast a Chipotle store can get customers in and out of stores — should improve with new technology in the works, such as Chippy and Autocado. A robot food assembly line could also unlock value.And the expansion of Chipotlanes could open up the restaurants to fulfill additional demand or create new features. A pivot to offering a breakfast menu is a possibility, said Tower.Imagine that: breakfast burritos, tacos, bowls, and maybe even avocado toast.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Kerry Hannon,Unretiring: More retirees are going back to work because they want to — or need to,"Richard Eisenberg retired in 2022.At 65, he stepped away from his job as managing editor for ""Next Avenue,"" the PBS website for people over 50, where he had worked for a decade.""I had a rough idea of what my retirement would be,"" Eisenberg told Yahoo Finance. ""I knew I would be 'unretiring' since I still wanted to be doing some writing, some editing, and some teaching, but not all the time.""So far, he has. Eisenberg, who lives in Westfield, N.J., explores ""unretirement"" in his expert columns, podcast and teaching posts, including an online NYU master class.""I'm seeing a lot of curiosity about the idea,"" he said. ""I'm still a little surprised that it seems like such a foreign concept to people.""A growing number of retirees like Eisenberg have stepped off the sidelines and headed back to work, especially after many were forced to retire in the pandemic, according to a new report from T. Rowe Price. Around 7% of retirees are looking for work in retirement, while 20% say they’re already working part time or full time.""In 2021, during the pandemic, that percentage was 10%,"" Judith Ward, a certified financial planner and thought leadership director at T.

Rowe Price report found. Men, in particular, were more likely to cite social connections as motivation to work.""A lot of us want to work part-time in retirement,"" Eisenberg said. ""We want to stay active, have social connections, bring in some income and to stay mentally engaged, but we also want to have time to do other things.""Plus, there’s the freedom to do what you want to do this time around, Eisenberg said. That means choosing a working route that isn’t stuffed with meetings, administrative duties — all ""the parts of our former job that we didn't like so much.""And then there are the psychological benefits that work can offer, Robert Laura, a retirement coach, told Yahoo Finance. Several studies have indicated the positive mental effects of working. In fact, among older adults, retirees are more likely to experience depression compared to those who are still working, according to one recent paper.""Work provides routine, structure, connection, mental stimulus, purpose, and relevance,"" Laura said.

Rebecca Chen,Homebuyers are putting more money down than ever before despite difficult housing conditions,"Buying conditions may be tough, but homebuyers are coming to the table with bigger down payments.The US median down payment increased 11.3% year over year in the third quarter to $30,434, marking the highest total since Realtor.com started tracking the data in 2013. The average down payment percentage reached 14.71% of the purchase price in the same period, also the highest in the last decade.The trend suggests that homebuyers in today’s market have the incentive and means to contribute large payments. They are leveraging their wealth — whether it is equity or cash — to beat out competitors without the same access.""The people who are able to play ball in this interesting market are more likely to be higher earners,"" Hannah Jones, economic research analyst at Realtor.com, told Yahoo Finance. ""Also because inventory is so tight and mortgage rates are so high, it's creating a more competitive environment where people are more likely to put more down as a means of competition because there's such limited inventory on the market.""Read more: Mortgage rates at 20-year high: Is 2023 a good time to buy a house? Many first-time homebuyers are edged out of today's real estate market as down payments increase.The same report also shows that the higher the income, the higher the success rate of landing a home purchase. The percentage of successful homebuyers is 42% for households earning $100,000 or more, 27% for households earning $50,000 to $99,999, and 19% for families making less than $50,000.Some younger homebuyers also are getting a leg up by getting money from family or other loved ones. A recent LendingTree report found that 78% of Gen Z and 54% of millennial homeowners received some type of financial assistance for down payment.""There's just no getting around how expensive houses are right now,"" Jacob Channel, LendingTree’s senior economist and report author, told Yahoo Finance. ""And because of that there's more incentive for people to say to a parent or somebody like that, 'I'd really like to buy a house but it's so prohibitively expensive, I need some help.'""These type of buyers are edging out potential first-time buyers who have limited means and a smaller down payment. The share of first-time buyers dropped to 29% in August from 30% a month ago.

Pras Subramanian,"EV sales hit new record in Q3 as Tesla market share dips
Though Tesla easily sells the most EVs, it is losing market share to rivals.","The electric vehicle transformation in the US hit yet another milestone last quarter, though further growth into the mainstream may still be elusive. This as Tesla’s lead at the top is narrowing.According to automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book (KBB), US EV sales in the third quarter crossed 313,000, nearly a 50% increase from a year ago, and around 15,000 more than the 298,000 sold in Q2. Cox Automotive (KBB's parent company) said EV market share hit 7.9%, its highest ever level and up from the 6.1% recorded a year ago.""Higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the US market,"" said Jonathan Smoke, Cox Automotive's chief economist.Three years ago, total EV sales for the year passed 250,000, and KBB says this year EV sales are on pace to top 1 million. KBB also noted 14 new EV models were now in the mix, and automakers like Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes, and Hyundai saw EV sales gains of over 200%, though at limited quantities. Of course the 800-pound gorilla in the room is Tesla, which sold over 150,000 EVs in the US, exactly half (50%) of the total amount sold. While a huge amount, Tesla’s share of the pie has been shrinking lately, with 50% its lowest level on record, and down from 62% a year ago.Though Tesla’s market share is slipping, its overall sales volume is increasing — up 19.5% year over year and beating the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%, KBB said.Coinciding with Tesla’s jump in overall sales have been its price cuts, which the company has been implementing aggressively over the past year or so. “In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped,” KBB noted in its report.Ford has also cut prices on its Mustang Mach-E SUV, and Ford Lightning EV pickup; however, big picture in the US at least, EVs are still relatively expensive, and that’s a major concern for consumers. KBB reports that the ATP (average transaction price) of an EV was $50,683, down a considerable amount from the $65,000 a year ago, but still more than gas-powered cars, which can still be had for under $30,000.Story continuesYahoo Finance noted this concern in our EV sentiment poll conducted with Ipsos, which found 70% of respondents were worried about overall cost of EVs, among other concerns.Tesla for its part has been trying to make EVs cheaper, with CEO Elon Musk claiming market share gains were more important than preserving Tesla’s industry best margins, which were once above 20%. That being said, without more sub-$40,000 EVs like Tesla’s Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt, the industry might struggle to hit a 10% EV market share, let alone 20% nationally.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley,Microsoft closes $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard,"Microsoft (MSFT) on Friday finalized its $69 billion purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI), according to a regulatory filing from the company Friday, in what is the largest-ever merger for the gaming market.The deal closed Friday after Microsoft cleared a final hurdle from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The regulator said concessions proposed in a revised acquisition agreement with Activision satisfied the antitrust regulator’s concerns that the transaction would give Microsoft an unfair advantage in the cloud gaming market.“The new deal will stop Microsoft from locking up competition in cloud gaming as this market takes off, preserving competitive prices and services for UK cloud gaming customers,” the CMA said in a press release.Under the renegotiated terms, French gaming company Ubisoft Entertainment SA will acquire the rights to Activision’s cloud gaming content for 15 years, ensuring that it will remain available on non-Windows operating systems.The deal makes Microsoft the third-largest video game company in the world by revenue behind Sony (SONY) and Tencent.The CMA was the last major roadblock keeping Microsoft from completing the purchase.In July, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suspended its administrative challenge to the deal after both a federal district court judge and a three-judge federal appellate court panel declined to grant the commission a preliminary injunction that would have kept the tie-up from happening as it battled the merger. An image from Activision's Call of Duty is shown on a smartphone near a photograph of the Microsoft logo. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File)Microsoft announced its plans to buy Activision Blizzard in January 2022. Activision Blizzard's incredibly successful ""Call of Duty"" franchise is key to the deal. The game series earns Activision Blizzard billions each year, with the latest installment, 2022's ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,"" clearing $1 billion in sales in its first 10 days on the market.To assuage the US’s and other regulators' concerns that Microsoft would abuse the deal to wall off ""Call of Duty"" from its rivals, the company has signed agreements with Nintendo, Nvidia, and, most recently, Sony, ensuring the game is available on their respective gaming consoles for at least 10 years.Microsoft says it intends to bring ""Call of Duty"" and Activision Blizzard's other franchises including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Diablo"" to its Xbox Game Pass cloud gaming platform. The move will give Microsoft a huge boost in the still nascent cloud gaming wars, drawing more gamers to its subscription offering.The service, which costs $15 per month to access Microsoft's cloud gaming service as well as the ability to download games to your console or PC, is well ahead of rival platforms Sony, Nvidia, and Amazon thanks to its wide array of games and ease of use.Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo

So increasing yields have a tightening effect, slowing economic activity.Though it's receded this week, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) has risen to levels last seen in 2007, climbing roughly 30 basis points since the Fed’s meeting in September.Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson pointed to the rise in yields and their impact in a speech earlier this week, pledging to ""remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields ... as I assess the future path of policy.""Jefferson said that the Fed is in a particularly sensitive period of managing risk, having to balance between the twin risks of too loose and too tight.Story continuesOther Fed officials have chimed in on the bond market acting like a pinch-hitter.“We're just kind of keeping a very close eye on that, and then we'll see how these higher rates feed into what we're trying to do in policy,” said Fed Governor Chris Waller on Wednesday.But as with the Fed’s previous rate increases, a rise in inflation or other unfavorable observations could force the central bank to move. And if yields slide, their tightening effect would diminish, creating a greater need for the Fed to enact a genuine hike instead of relying on a substitute.There’s a circular logic to all of this, which means it can turn on a dime.As Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said earlier this week, it’s possible higher bond yields will mean less work for the Fed. But if those yields are higher because the market’s expectations for the Fed are changing, the Fed might have to follow through on those expectations to keep those yields high.In other words, there's a wobbly Jenga tower of expectations.“It’s hard for me to say definitively that because they moved, we don’t have to move,” Kashkari said. “I don’t know yet.”For now, as some Fed officials think the focus of the tightening campaign should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels, the latest data might support more of a let-the-bond-market-do-the-work approach.While the likelihood of a rate hike next month has fallen, that may be because one has already come through. It just didn’t come from the Fed.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Brooke DiPalma,"Halloween spending expected to hit record high as sugar prices continue to rise
Consumer spending on candy, costumes, and decorations is projected to top $11 billion.","Getting a sugar rush is becoming more expensive, but that hasn't spooked enthusiastic Halloween fans.In September, the cost of sugar and sugar substitutes is up 7.7% compared to a year ago, while candy and chewing gum jumped 7.5%. Prices of other sweets rose nearly 3% compared to last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) latest Consumer Price Index (CPI).On a yearly basis, the overall sugar and sweets category rose 6.5%, including a 0.3% jump compared to the month prior.That's higher than overall food inflation, which increased 0.2% in September on a monthly basis and 3.7% year over year. The cost of groceries — food at home — jumped 0.1% and 2.4%, respectively.But fret not, trick-or-treaters. Consumers are expected to spend $3.6 billion dollars on candy this year, a nearly 14% jump from last year's total of $3.1 billion. That figure is an all-time high, according to the National Retail Federation. And nearly three-fourths of Americans, 73%, are expected to participate in Halloween festivities, higher than 69% last year. Halloween candy is for sale at a Harris Teeter grocery store last year. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Despite the noise, companies and consumers are moving forward, ready to celebrate.A Hershey (HSY) spokesperson told Yahoo Finance there are no candy shortages related to the cost of sugar.""[Movements] in sugar, as far as total manufacturing cost, are really very minimal to the manufacturer,"" Branch said, when compared to the cost to produce, ship, and distribute the candy.On a call with investors following its Q2 results, Hershey CEO Michele Buck said the company expects a ""very strong Halloween,"" with planned marketing and an approach of ""leaning into Halloween.""It's also business as usual at Mars. ""We met all our commitments to retailers, and even ended up being able to exceed the amount of candy we committed to in some cases,"" a spokesperson said.Consumers are leaning in too.

Josh Schafer,Fed can stay 'patient' after inflation data as odds rise on a December rate hike,"Thursday's inflation report showed prices in September rose at roughly the same pace seen in August.But when removing volatile categories like food, energy, and shelter, economists see a downward trend in price increases, a welcomed sign for a Federal Reserve that had spent the days ahead of this data indicating a bias against raising interest rates again in November.Still, this data shows the Fed has work to do in bringing inflation back to its 2% target, keeping the possibility of an interest rate increase in December in focus for investors.As of Thursday morning, markets were pricing in a 12% chance the Fed hikes in November, down from a 41% chance a month ago, data from the CME Group showed.

Pras Subramanian,"How the UAW's surprise strike may 'force Ford's hand' at bargaining table
Ford's important Kentucky Truck Plant makes vehicles with $10K profit margins.","A major surprise came for Ford (F) on Wednesday night, the 27th day of the United Auto Workers (UAW) stand-up strikes.The UAW called an unplanned walkout at Ford’s sprawling Kentucky Truck Plant, a massive escalation because this plant builds Ford’s F-250 through F-550 super duty trucks, Expedition SUV, and Lincoln Navigator SUV. While the top selling F-150 was spared, Ford says Kentucky Truck plant is responsible for $25 billion in revenue annually.The UAW said in a statement the strike at Kentucky Truck was called after Ford “refused to make further movement in bargaining,” marking a new phase for the stand up strikes. “If they can’t understand that after four weeks, the 8,700 workers shutting down this extremely profitable plant will help them understand it,” Fain said. Turning up the pressure on Ford: the Kentucky Truck assembly plant in Louisville. (Joseph White/REUTERS)Fiorani, whose firm tracks auto production and plant productivity across the globe, says profits on vehicles at Kentucky Truck can easily top $10,000 per unit, making them among the most important in Ford's product portfolio.“It is also a shot across the industry to tell GM and Stellantis to step up their game or else their big and profitable models would be targeted next,” Fiorani said.Story continuesCase in point: Last week the UAW did not expand strikes against the Big Three, as Fain said a major concession was made by GM (GM) — the automaker supposedly said it would allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to unionize. This was a major move as it would likely mean Ford and Stellantis (STLA) would have to agree to similar terms in the collective bargaining process as the entire industry transforms itself from gas-powered cars to electrified vehicles.It’s possible Ford was not budging on its stance of not allowing unionization at its upcoming battery plants in Tennessee, and other locations. Whether this changes Ford’s calculus on its battery plants remains to be seen.Stay tuned. Friday, the UAW is expected to announce its next steps.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Kerry Hannon,Social Security benefits will increase 3.2% next year,"The increase in Social Security benefits next year will exceed the 20-year average, but it still pales in comparison to this year’s boost.The Social Security Administration, the federal government agency that oversees the benefits, announced a 3.2% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2024. That’s well above the 2.6% average over the past two decades, but it’s less than half the 8.7% increase retirees saw in 2023, which was the biggest in four decades.The increase will add more than $50 to the average monthly benefit of $1,848 starting in January, according to the SSA.Read more: How to find out your 2024 Social Security COLA increaseThe adjustment will provide some comfort to the more than 70 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who have faced higher prices this year, but it may not be enough to alleviate retirees' ongoing budget concerns.""This COLA might disappoint Social Security beneficiaries after last year’s adjustment,"" Emerson Sprick, senior economic analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told Yahoo Finance. ""But it actually suggests that macroeconomic conditions are improving in a way that likely benefits seniors’ household finances. It goes without saying that having stable prices is highly preferable to having large COLAs."" (Getty Creative)Rising costs for retirees’ budget next year may also be linked to Medicare premiums for 2024, which were announced Thursday by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Johnson added. The Social Security Administration automatically deducts Medicare Part B premiums from Social Security benefits before the benefits are received.Medicare Part B covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, durable medical equipment, and certain other medical and health services not covered by Medicare Part A, which covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility, hospice, lab tests, surgery, and home health care.The 2024 standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will be $174.70 for 2024, an increase of $9.80 from $164.90 in 2023. The annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will be $240 in 2024, an increase of $14 from the annual deductible of $226 in 2023.And there’s an additional worry for retirees' budgets.""When incomes grow like they did this year with an 8.7% COLA, more older taxpayers pay tax on a bigger portion of their Social Security benefits, and we expect this trend to continue in 2024,"" Johnson said.About a quarter ( 26%) of The Senior Citizens League survey participants who have received Social Security for more than three years report paying taxes on a portion of their benefits for the first time during the 2023 tax season (for tax year 2022).""Because Social Security recipients received an even higher COLA of 8.7% in 2023, we expect more beneficiaries to become liable for federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits for the first time in the upcoming 2024 tax season,"" Johnson said.Kerry Hannon is a Senior Reporter and Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Hamza Shaban,Inflation is higher than the Fed wants. The problem could be its target.,"With a singular focus the Federal Reserve has struggled to pull inflation down to its 2% target. By its own forecasts, US central bankers won’t complete the mission until 2026. The dedication to a yearslong journey has cemented the idea that rates will stay higher for longer or that even more drastic rate hikes — and possibly a recession — will be required to achieve an elusive 2%.While reaching that goal has long been entrenched in the Fed’s mission and public commitments, the costs of doing so have invited some calls to aim for a more realistic goal, fit for the current moment: raising the inflation target.The main argument for upping the desired rate boils down to the difficulty in trying to get down to 2%. Fed officials would have to knock the economy so forcefully, the thinking goes, they would likely spark a recession to get there — as stubborn winds blow in the face of its inflation fight.But central bankers have resisted such calls, with one Fed official even saying the implications could be disastrous. WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 20: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference after a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 20, 2023 at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC. In the face of slowing inflation and strong consumer spending, the Federal Reserve announced that it will keep the interest rate steady, holding the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)“They already cost themselves credibility by trying to convince us that inflation was transitory,” said Russell Hackmann, president of Hackmann Wealth Partners LLC. Changing the inflation target all of a sudden, he said, would be akin to “the kid who grades his own homework.”But a big-picture review of the Fed’s inflation goal is still a possibility, as even Powell has acknowledged. “There may be a longer-run project at some point,” he has said.Other critics of the powerful role of central banks have pushed for a bigger overhaul, questioning the heavy reliance on what they see as an imprecise lever of roundabout rate setting.Joshua Ryan-Collins, an economics professor at UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, said the paradigm of prior decades worked in an environment of low inflation and stable growth. But the disruptions unleashed by COVID and by the Russian invasion of Ukraine have shown that model is not sustainable. “If central banks really want to deal with modern-day inflation they have to rethink their approach on the drivers of inflation and worry less about the short-term demand side,” he said.

WAYNE PARRY,Coastal county and groups sue to overturn federal approval of New Jersey's 1st offshore wind farm,"OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) — The government of New Jersey's southernmost county has joined with environmental and fishing industry groups in suing the federal government in a bid to overturn its approval of the state's first offshore wind energy farm.Cape May County and the groups filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court against two federal agencies — the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management — seeking to reverse their approval of the Ocean Wind I project.Current plans call for construction of the project in waters off southern New Jersey by the Danish wind power company Orsted.The plaintiffs allege that the two agencies did not follow the requirements of nearly a dozen federal laws in approving the project, which would be built off the coast of Atlantic City and Ocean City — two of the state's top tourism destinations. They also claim the agencies did not adequately consider potential harm to the environment and marine life from offshore wind projects.“To implement a massive new program to generate electrical energy by constructing thousands of turbine towers offshore ... and laying hundreds of miles of high-tension electrical cables undersea, the United States has shortcut the statutory and regulatory requirements that were enacted to protect our nation’s environmental and natural resources, its industries, and its people,” the suit read.Both agencies declined comment Wednesday.Orsted declined comment on the lawsuit, but said it ""remains committed to collaboration with local communities, and will continue working to support New Jersey’s clean energy targets and economic development goals by bringing good-paying jobs and local investment to the Garden State.”The lawsuit is the latest challenge — legal and otherwise — to the nascent offshore wind industry in the Northeast, which is also facing rising costs and supply chain concerns in addition to political and residential opposition to its projects.Story continuesIn New Jersey alone, there have already been numerous lawsuits filed by and against Orsted over the project, as well as challenges by residents groups to various levels of federal and state approval of the project, which would built 98 wind turbines about 15 miles (24 kilometers) off the shoreline.A tax break New Jersey approved in July for Orsted has heightened opposition to the Orsted proposal and offshore wind in general. Earlier this month the company put up a $100 million guarantee that it will build the project by Dec. 2025.Proposed wind farms in other states have run into financial difficulties as well. Last week, New York regulators denied a request by companies for larger subsidies for offshore wind, solar and other projects.Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the Clean Ocean Action environmental group; the Garden State Seafood Association; the Greater Wildwood Hotel and Motel Association; Lamonica Fine Foods; Lund's Fisheries, and Surfside Seafood Products.___Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly known as Twitter, at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC",Yahoo
Will Daniel,"If you’re in the 1% or middle class, inflation has actually made you richer, according to a top economist who’s been researching inequality for over 40 years","Throughout his career, famed economist Milton Friedman described inflation as a “hidden tax.” When prices rise consistently, he warned, they cut into consumers’ purchasing power, forcing them to earn more money (and pay more in taxes) to maintain the same lifestyle. On top of that, nominal wage and revenue increases during periods of high inflation can end up pushing an unlucky group of consumers and businesses into higher tax brackets even as their purchasing power falls—an effect called “bracket creep.”“Inflation is a form of taxation without representation. It is the kind of tax that can be imposed without being legislated by the authorities and without having to employ additional tax collectors,” Friedman famously wrote in a 1974 article that called for the indexing of tax brackets in order to prevent “bracket creep.”This so-called income-tax feature of inflation has made it incredibly unpopular among the public. As Tom Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, explained in a recent interview with CNN:“The one thing that I hear loud and clear from everybody is that they hate inflation. They find inflation to be unfair. You get a raise, and then you have to spend that raise at the gas station,” he said. “It’s frankly exhausting.”But now, new research has added a wrinkle to the popular view of inflation as nothing but a downer. In a new working paper whose title asks, “Is There Really an Inflation Tax?” New York University economist Edward Nathan Wolff, an expert on inequality with nearly 40 years of research to his name, breaks down the effects of inflation on Americans’ overall wealth between 1983 and 2019.His answer? The “inflation tax” does exist, but not for everybody. The middle class and the top 1% of Americans actually benefited from periods of high inflation in recent decades. “With regard to the issue of whether there is really a net inflation tax, the answer is that it is true for some groups only,” Wolff wrote.Story continuesA ‘tax’ that hits unequallyIn his paper, which was published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of business cycles, Wolff pored over data from the consumer price index and Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to measure changes in consumers’ incomes and overall wealth during periods of sustained inflation.The economist, who serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Economic Inequality and the Review of Income and Wealth, found that although there is definitely an “inflation tax” on consumers’ incomes—measured as the difference between nominal and real income growth—there’s another, more positive side to inflation as well. (Wolff’s books on inequality include 2015’s Inheriting Wealth in America: Future Boom or Bust? and 2017’s A Century of Wealth in America.)Inflation can cause asset prices, particularly in real estate, to rise substantially, while simultaneously lowering the real debt burdens of some consumers. This means that a lucky group of households that have a large amount of assets or debt relative to their incomes—say, recent homebuyers who are “house poor” or the ultrarich—have historically seen a sizable gain in household wealth thanks to inflation, Wolff explained.“In terms of household well-being, inflation is a net boon to the middle class. The top 1% of the wealth distribution also gains handsomely from inflation. On the other hand, poor households (the bottom two quintiles in terms of wealth) get clobbered by inflation,” he wrote.Comparing the difference between inflation’s erosion of incomes and its boost to wealth, Wolff calculated the “net inflation gain” or NIG for each income bracket in the U.S.The top 1% of Americans saw a “robust” NIG of $63,500, or 6.9% of their mean annual income between 1983 and 2019. However, for those who were merely very wealthy, but below the 1%, it was a different story.Those in the 95th to 99th percentile of wealth have a much lower wealth-to-income ratio, which caused their NIG to come in at -$56,200, or 18% of their mean income. NIG was also negative for Americans in the 80th to 95th percentile of wealth.The equation flips for the upper middle class, however. Americans in the 60th to 80th wealth percentile—today, that means a household net worth of roughly $200,000 to $550,000—tend to have a high portion of their wealth in real estate. As a result, for this group, inflation led to a NIG of $12,700, or 16% of their mean yearly income between 1983 and 2019. Essentially, inflation eroded these consumers’ mortgage payments and inflated their assets more than enough to make up for the losses their income took from having to pay more for other goods and services.The boost was even bigger for squarely middle-class households, or those in the 40th to 60th wealth percentile. This group saw an NIG of nearly $40,000, or two-thirds of their annual income. “Indeed, inflation has been a boon to the middle class in terms of its balance sheet,” Wolff wrote of the findings.For the bottom two quintiles of the wealth distribution, however, inflation remains a nightmare. Wolff found that this group’s NIG was -$19,300, or almost half of their mean income. “It is clear that poor households were particularly hard hit by inflation,” he wrote.Wolff said his findings pose an urgent question: “Why is the public, particularly the middle class, so opposed to inflation?”His answer was that consumers tend to feel the psychological effects caused by inflation eroding their incomes, but they are often “not aware” of the commonly positive effects that it can have on their assets and debt. It’s easy to see rising prices at the grocery store or while filling up at the gas station, but for many consumers, the positive wealth effect that comes from inflation lowering the lifetime real cost of a mortgage is less obvious.However, the Great Recession, the pandemic, and the dotcom bubble all helped push more Americans out of the middle class, at least in terms of income, over the past decades. Between 1971 and 2021, the number of “middle income” Americans fell from 61% to 50%, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. Part of the reason for this hollowing out of the middle class was a seven-percentage-point increase in the “upper income” category, but the amount of lower income Americans also grew by five percentage points—and many have blamed inflation for that outcome. A point that Wolff doesn’t touch on is that inflation is massively unpopular because the hidden tax is affecting more Americans who are missing out on entry into the middle class.Should the Fed be aiming at a higher inflation target?Overall, Wolff’s findings suggest that lower rates of inflation would protect poorer families, but also hurt the middle class, thereby (ironically) raising overall wealth inequality. This has implications for federal policy, and suggests, rather than the Federal Reserve’s longtime target of 2% inflation, it could make sense to have a slightly higher overall inflation target. Of course, that higher rate comes with its own issues for the poorest Americans.To combat the negative effect of inflation on the poor, Wolff proposed an interesting solution: an inflation tax credit. He argued that the IRS should calculate the rate of inflation in the preceding year and then use that figure to “modify the tax code” and offer incentives to those most affected by rising prices.“Varying this tax credit across the income distribution could reduce the burden of inflation for poor families while still allowing middle-income families to capture its benefits,” he wrote.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo
Ines Ferré,"Oil jumps as Iran increases rhetoric against Israel, US stockpiles drop","Oil jumped on Wednesday after Iran called for an embargo against Israel amid the Israeli-Hamas war and a drop in US stockpiles signaled increased demand for crude.Brent (BZ=F) crude jumped almost 2% to hover above $91 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) also rose almost 2%, trading beyond $88 per barrel.Iran’s foreign minister called for the crude boycott by Muslim countries against Israel after a bombing at a Gaza hospital, for which each side is blaming the other.The call comes amid President Biden’s arrival to the region in support of Israel. The heads of Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority canceled a meeting with President Biden. The cancelation doesn’t bode well for the president’s efforts to stabilize the region and make sure the fighting doesn’t broaden.""Iran's involvement is the key focus for the crude market and this is essentially because they are a huge crude producer,"" Rebecca Babin, CIBC Private Wealth energy trader, told Yahoo Finance Live earlier this week.Last week prices jumped on worries that a disruption to Iran's output of roughly 3.2 million barrels per day would impact the global price of crude.""If one million barrels per day is knocked out of the market ...

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,A surge in wealth has boosted most US households since 2020 and helped sustain economic growth,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The net worth of the typical U.S. household grew at the fastest pace in more than three decades from 2020 through 2022, while relatively low interest rates at that time made it easier for households to pay their debts, according to a government report Wednesday.Wealth for the median household — the midpoint between the richest and poorest households — jumped 37% during those three years, the Federal Reserve reported, to nearly $193,000. (The figures are adjusted for inflation.) The increase reflected primarily a jump in home values and higher stock prices and a rise in the proportion of Americans who own homes and stocks.The jump in wealth occurred even as the brief but brutal pandemic recession cost 20 million Americans their jobs in 2020. Extensive government relief aid, totaling about $5 trillion, helped spur a rapid recovery that regained the lost jobs much faster than had been true after the 2008-2009 recession. The additional spending, though, is believed to have helped fuel the worst bout of inflation in four decades.The broad-based wealth increase helps explain the surprising durability of the U.S. economy this year and the consumer spending that powers about two-thirds of it. For at least a year, economists have been warning of a forthcoming recession. Yet the economy has kept chugging along.Economic growth in the just-completed July-September quarter might have topped a robust 4% annual rate, boosted by strong consumer spending for physical goods as well as for services, a broad category that includes airline travel, entertainment, restaurant meals and other experiences.Government-provided stimulus payments in the aftermath of the pandemic also boosted households' finances. The median value of checking and savings accounts and other cash holdings surged 30%, according to the Fed's survey, which it conducts every three years. And with borrowing rates historically low, Americans dedicated just 13.4% of their incomes to paying off debt in 2022, the lowest such proportion since the Fed survey began in 1989.Story continuesEven so, substantial wealth inequality remained in place during the survey period, reflecting decades of widening disparities between the richest households and everyone else. Among the wealthiest 10% of households, median wealth reached nearly $3.8 million in 2022.Still, more Americans bought individual stocks after the pandemic — a likely reflection, in some way, of the “meme stock” craze that was fueled partly by stimulus checks. The proportion of families that directly owned stocks — as opposed through mutual funds — jumped from 15% to 21%, a record increase, the survey found.The median value of individual stock holdings was $15,000, the Fed report said. The average value of direct stock ownership was much higher — $404,000 — the survey found, reflecting the holdings of richer families.Household net worth rose more, on a percentage basis, for Black and Hispanic households than for white ones, though measured in dollar terms the disparities remained wide. The median net worth of Black households jumped 60% but remained comparatively low at $45,000. For Hispanics, the figure surged 47% to nearly $62,000. Among white households, median household net worth rose 31% to $285,000.The Fed’s survey found that even as wealth inequality declined, income disparities worsened. Median incomes grew 3% compared with the previous survey, which covered 2017 through 2019. But average incomes, which are swollen by the earnings of the wealthiest one-tenth of households, jumped 15%. The outsize gain among the richest households was driven by profits on stock and property holdings as well as higher wages.Yet the income data was also more complicated than usual in this report, Fed officials noted. It did not, for example, capture the effects of stimulus checks. And the report focused on incomes in 2021, when many Americans were still grappling with job losses from the pandemic recession.Other economic research has found that since the pandemic struck in 2020, wages have actually grown faster for lower-income workers than for wealthier ones. That reflects the fact that restaurants, hotels, warehouses and many other service businesses dramatically raised pay to try to attract desperately needed workers.A March 2023 research paper by David Autor, an economist at MIT; Arindrajit Dube, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and Anne McGrew, a Ph.D. student at UMass, found that rising wages for the lowest-paid one-tenth of workers from 2019 to 2022 managed to reverse one-quarter of the increase in income inequality since 1980.",Yahoo
Alice Gledhill and Sujata Rao,Apollo’s Slok Sees More Economic Hardship as US Defaults Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has a clear message for investors: interest rate-hikes are working and policymakers want you to shelter in risk-free assets.Most Read from BloombergBiden Vows Aid for Gaza, Backs Israel Over Hospital BlastHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameStocks Drop, Oil Climbs on Renewed Mideast Risks: Markets WrapUPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastEvidence of an economic slowdown is piling up, and that’s exactly what central bankers in the US and Europe want, he says, pointing to rising delinquency rates on credit card loans, junk-bond defaults, a rapid slowdown in banking lending and softer labor markets.It marks a regime shift from the era of easy money, when the Federal Reserve was effectively telling investors to bypass Treasuries for stocks and low-rated credit. Now, it’s thrown that process into reverse, a process that investors should be wary of fighting, Slok added.“Now Powell is saying, I’m going to increase the risk-free rate more and more, because the Fed wants to pull dollars out of risky assets in order to lower inflation,” he said. “There’s a competition for dollars and the risk-free rate is attracting more money from investors.”In his view, the economy has been resilient because higher-income households are being supported by the vast savings accumulated during the pandemic. A US retail sales report on Tuesday that topped expectations sparked a selloff in global stocks on concern that strong consumer spending means the Fed will have to hold rates higher for longer.Against that backdrop, it’s time to shift money into higher-quality assets like floating-rate, short-dated corporate bonds, Slok said. He also expects further inflows into money markets funds, which invest in safe short-dated assets like government bills.He also warned about neglecting credit risk analysis in the pursuit of juicy yields. A Bloomberg Global High Yield index is trading above 9.80%, more than double the low it reached in mid 2021.Story continues“Credit investors are not compensated appropriately for the risk of buying the high yield index,” he said. “The risk is that it’s going to be cheaper in six months time. That is why investors need to go up in quality to protect themselves.”In equity markets, strong earnings from a handful of companies, what Slok refers to as the “S&P 7” that includes stocks like Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc., are obscuring weakness in the rest of the index, or the “S&P 493.”“Fed policy is working exactly as the textbook would have predicted,” he said. “Consumers and firms are falling behind on their payments and it is beginning to bite.”Meanwhile in rates markets, Slok warned investors should heed the actions by central banks and stick to shorter maturities. Two-year Treasuries have been yielding around 5% for more than three months, in contrast to a violent selloff at the longer end of the curve.“If there’s one thing investors know for sure, it is that the Fed is saying rates are going to be higher for longer,” he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJeep’s Jump to $100,000 SUVs Risks Leaving Loyal Buyers BehindThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal Again©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
Julie Hyman,Why you shouldn't listen to Jamie Dimon,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsEarlier in the week, Jamie Dimon got our attention by calling this perhaps “the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.”And that may be true, from a geopolitical perspective. Wars are now raging in both Ukraine and Israel, with broader implications. Dimon also pointed to the risks of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program at a time when inflation is persisting.As my colleague Brian Sozzi wrote this week, when one of the most powerful CEOs in the world makes a dramatic comment like that, you take notice.But in markets, it’s always a good idea to think about how someone may be talking his book.“For Jamie Dimon — for a bank that has strongly outperformed its peers, it’s a matter really of trying to lower expectations,” Ken Leon, a veteran bank analyst at CFRA, told Yahoo Finance Live. “That’s always his mission, to lower the bar, because it’s the one bank every quarter that outperforms and delivers across all the lines of business.” (JPM happens to be one of Leon’s top picks).And if you tune Dimon out, there are quite a few reassuring signals.Take Tuesday’s retail sales report, which came in double economists’ estimates. While it could put pressure on the Fed to raise rates once again, central bank officials have presented a remarkably consistent message over the past couple of weeks: They are willing to be patient, and higher Treasury yields are helping tighten financial conditions without them having to further raise rates at this time.Spurred by that retail sales data, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast now stands at 5.4% annualized growth for the third quarter. The S&P 500 has bounced back by more than 3% since early October. Early earnings from the big banks and the likes of Johnson & Johnson have beat estimates.Story continuesBank of America’s weekly fund flows data showed an 11th straight week of inflows into equities, with buyers favoring cyclicals over defensives — implying optimism about economic growth.Maybe investors should pay attention to what Dimon said after his warning: “While we hope for the best, we prepare the Firm for a broad range of outcomes so we can consistently deliver for clients no matter the environment.”In other words, while there appear to be positive signs for the economy and markets, it never hurts to be prepared for anything. morning brief imageClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo
Rich Miller,Wall Street Concerns Over Swelling US Debt Put Fed in Tight Spot,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve faces potential policy pitfalls ahead as it wrestles with how to respond to investor angst about the US government’s $33.5 trillion mountain of debt.Most Read from BloombergBiden Vows Aid for Gaza, Backs Israel Over Hospital BlastHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameStocks Drop, Oil Climbs on Renewed Mideast Risks: Markets WrapUPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastConcerns about America’s fiscal future have already contributed to a run-up in US bond yields that has surprised policymakers and prompted them to consider postponing for now plans for another interest-rate increase.Worries on Wall Street about the US budgetary morass pose risks to both sides of the central bank’s dual mandate.The disquiet over deficits and debt puts upward pressure on long-term interest rates, threatening to slow growth and push up unemployment. At the same time, it can also act as kindling for higher inflation, especially if the Fed is perceived as downplaying its goal of price stability in order to limit the federal government’s borrowing costs.“We are witnessing the beginning of a regime change in how investors perceive America’s fiscal sustainability,” said former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, who was an adviser to President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2006.To be sure, there are other forces at play behind a downdraft in bond prices that has driven the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 4.83% yesterday from this year’s low of 3.31% on April 6. Prime among them: the resilience of the US economy in the face of the most aggressive credit-tightening campaign by the Fed in decades.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will weigh in with his views in an appearance before the Economic Club of New York Thursday.Fed watchers expect him to tacitly back an emerging consensus among policymakers that the higher yields give them a chance to hold policy steady at their Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting as they assess the outlook.Story continuesBut with inflation still running faster than the Fed’s 2% objective, Powell will likely hold out the possibility of a rate increase later in the year.What Bloomberg Economics Says...The recent surge in 10-year Treasury yields will dampen economic growth, similar to a Fed rate hike. Bloomberg Economics estimates the increase since the Sept. 19-20 FOMC meeting, if sustained, should reduce the need for 50 basis points of interest rates.—Anna Wong, chief US economistTo read the full note, click here“The threat of another hike will remain with us as long as we’re approaching inflation from so far above their target,” MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC founder and former Fed economist Julia Coronado said.Ex-Fed Vice Chair Donald Kohn said that in general, Powell and other officials should speak out about the impact of fiscal policy on the economy, interest rates and the central bank.“It would help the economic conversation in the country if they at least talked about the consequences for monetary policy and the economy,” said Kohn, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Former Treasury official Mark Sobel — who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations — is blunter. Fed officials need to warn the public about the potentially deleterious impact of US profligacy on markets and the economy, said Sobel, who’s US chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a research organization.It’s been conventional wisdom for a while that the federal budget is on an unsustainable path of mushrooming debt. But a confluence of recent events has pushed those concerns to the forefront.QuickTake: Why US Deficit Is a Worry Again, and Will Remain SoIn August, Fitch Ratings Inc. stripped the US of its top-tier AAA credit rating while the Treasury announced a bigger-than-expected quarterly borrowing requirement. An estimate last week from the Congressional Budget Office that the deficit jumped by more than 20% in the just-ended fiscal year, to $1.7 trillion, added to the unease.“It’s just hard to believe that this is a sustainable policy going forward,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Oct. 11 at the E2 Summit in Park City, Utah.Administration officials insist that President Joe Biden is committed to reducing the budget shortfall and they argue that his initiatives to boost public infrastructure spending and promote private investment to fight climate change will help the economy in the long-run.Other WorriesBut it’s not just the mounting supply of Treasury securities that’s spooked investors. It’s also weakening demand. Many investors worry that the two biggest foreign holders of US debt, China and Japan, will scale back their purchases.The Fed itself is already cutting back, methodically reducing its bond holdings in an operation known as quantitative tightening. And officials have signaled they’ll continue to do so even after they begin expected cuts in interest rates sometime next year.“The bar is very high” to the Fed veering from that path, Coronado said.The rise in yields is threatening to make the untenable fiscal outlook even worse, said former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who advised George W. Bush while he was in office.“We have a super-interest-sensitive budget,” said Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum. “If the bond market is starting to decipher more accurately the effective fiscal position of the US, then we’re in trouble.”Warsh agreed. “It’s exceedingly difficult to have sound monetary policy without sound fiscal policy,” the Hoover Institution visiting fellow said. “And US fiscal policy is decidedly unsound.”--With assistance from Liz Capo McCormick and Matthew Boesler.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJeep’s Jump to $100,000 SUVs Risks Leaving Loyal Buyers BehindThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal Again©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
Swati Pandey,RBA’s Bullock Highlights Difficulties in Cooling Inflation,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank Governor Michele Bullock pointed to a series of obstacles to bringing inflation back to target that range from sticky services prices to repeated global shocks including the Israel-Hamas war.Most Read from BloombergHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls Support“There are a few things that are suggestive that it’s going to be difficult to get inflation down,” the Reserve Bank chief said during a fireside chat in Sydney on Wednesday, pointing to price pressures in everything from takeaway shops to hairdressers, as well as ultra-low unemployment.Then there are supply shocks from global events that policymakers tend to look through, but are struggling to do so this time. “The problem is that we’ve got shock after shock after shock and the more that keeps inflation elevated, even if it’s a supply shock, the more people adjust their thinking, the more entrenched inflation is likely to become, so that’s the challenge.”Bullock, in her first public appearance since taking the helm at the central bank, didn’t specifically address the outlook for monetary policy.The central bank has increased interest rates by 4 percentage points since May 2022 in a bid to gain control over inflation that remains well above the 2-3% target. Economists expect one final hike, as early as next month, to take the cash rate to 4.35%.All eyes are on monthly employment data released on Thursday and the third-quarter inflation report next week for indications of what the RBA will do. The central bank also receive its staff’s quarterly update of economic forecasts at the Nov. 7 policy meeting.“It’s a challenging economic environment,” Bullock said. “What we are observing is that monetary policy is starting to bite. We are seeing a slowdown in consumption.”Story continuesAustralia’s benchmark policy rate is lower than many other developed nations despite inflation being at least as high. The RBA’s 4 points of hikes in the current tightening campaign trail both the US and New Zealand’s 5.25 points.“We are trying to bring inflation back down in a reasonable amount of time while preserving employment gains and not really bringing the economy to its knees,” Bullock said.Data on Australia’s A$2.3 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy has been mixed. Businesses are coping better with higher borrowing costs than households, with consumer sentiment in “deeply pessimistic” territory.The labor market has proved resilient with the unemployment rate hovering between 3.4%-3.7% over the past year, near its lowest level since the 1970s. The residential property market has also unexpectedly rebounded strongly this year.The housing market “has surprised me a bit,” Bullock said, noting it was now back at pandemic-era peaks.(Updates with unemployment range over past year, extra comments.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
Max Reyes,U.S. Bancorp Vows to Shrink Itself to Avoid Added Fed Scrutiny,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Bancorp promised federal regulators it would shrink its balance sheet and reduce its risk profile, a move that frees it from more stringent regulations.Most Read from BloombergHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportThe nation’s largest regional lender won approval from the Federal Reserve to retain its designation as a Category III bank, it said in a regulatory filing. That means it faces less costly and time-consuming regulations.The promises to shrink itself came after the lender, which had $665 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, spent months preparing to comply with the rules associated with becoming a so-called Category II bank, a designation given to lenders with more than $700 billion in assets.“U.S. Bancorp represents that it anticipates taking further actions to reduce its projected risk profile, including further net reductions in assets and increases in regulatory capital,” Ann Misback, secretary for the Federal Reserve Board, said in a letter to U.S. Bancorp’s lawyer. Based on the fact’s the company presented, she said, the board “has approved U.S. Bancorp’s request for complete relief from the commitments.”A spokesman for U.S. Bancorp declined to comment on the letter. Shares of the Minneapolis-based lender surged 7% to close Tuesday at $34.89, the biggest gain since March.A Category II designation would have brought stricter liquidity requirements, an annual rather than biennial company-run stress test, and a more complex methodology for determining its capital requirements.‘Very Positive’U.S. Bancorp has already taken steps to decrease risk, according to the Fed. That includes reducing its investment portfolio by about $30 billion and completing loan sales and securitizations worth roughly $7 billion, while reducing short-term borrowing on its balance sheet, the Fed said.Story continuesIn its decision, the central bank also cited a series of proposals it has made that will tighten rules for Category III lenders, such as one that will require such lenders to include unrealized losses on their balance sheet investments in their capital ratios.U.S. Bancorp agreed to submit to a stricter regulatory regime as part of its deal for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s Union Bank. It has previously said it would be able to comply with the more stringent rules by the end of 2024.“The regulatory change is very positive for U.S. Bancorp,” Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. “It will give the company greater flexibility in managing its balance sheet over the next two years.”--With assistance from Jenny Surane.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
HARM VENHUIZEN,Federal jury convicts 2 employees in fatal Wisconsin corn mill explosion,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A federal jury has convicted two senior employees at a Wisconsin corn plant of falsifying records and obstructing an investigation into a fatal corn dust explosion in 2017, Justice Department officials announced on Tuesday.Corn dust is explosive, and high concentrations are dangerous. Federal regulations require grain mill operators to perform regular cleanings to reduce dust accumulations that could fuel a blast.Jurors found Derrick Clark, vice president of operations at Didion Milling, and Shawn Mesner, a former food safety superintendent at the company, guilty of multiple safety, environmental and fraud charges on Friday. The two men are the latest in a growing list of Didion employees found guilty in association with the 2017 explosion that killed five people at the company's Cambria corn mill.Attorneys listed for both men did not immediately respond to voicemails seeking comment on Tuesday.Didion Milling pleaded guilty in September to charges that its employees falsified environmental and safety compliance records for years leading up to the explosion. The company agreed to pay a $1 million fine and $10.25 million to the estates of the five workers who were killed.Clark was convicted on Friday of making false Clean Air Act compliance certifications and lying to investigators during a deposition. Mesner was found guilty of conspiring to mislead Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators by lying on sanitation records that tracked cleanings meant to remove corn dust from the mill.“Derrick Clark and Shawn Messner chose to intentionally mislead OSHA investigators and made false statements about their knowledge of working conditions at the plant to protect themselves and cover their mistakes,” OSHA Regional Administrator Bill Donovan said in a statement.Sentencing hearings have not yet been scheduled for either of the men. At least five other Didion employees have pleaded guilty or been convicted of charges including concealing environmental violations, lying to investigators and falsifying cleaning logs.___Harm Venhuizen is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Sam Kim,"Bank of Korea to Keep Rate on Hold as Debt, Conflict Weigh on Economy","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea is poised to hold its benchmark interest rate steady as it seeks to quell a resurgence in household debt while also preserving economic momentum.Most Read from BloombergHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportAll 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect South Korea’s central bank to keep the rate at 3.5% when the board convenes on Thursday. It would be the sixth consecutive hold since authorities last hiked in January.The meeting comes as the crisis in the Middle East threatens to boost oil prices and exacerbate global inflationary pressure. Domestically, private loans are increasing again as housing prices rebound, alarming policymakers who consider high household debt levels a major long-term risk for economic growth.Household debt hit a record 1,079.8 trillion won ($798 billion) as of the end of September as mortgages rose by the most since February 2020, according to central bank data. BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong has urged potential home buyers to be aware that rates could stay high for longer than expected.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“We expect a shift away from its tight stance in the second quarter of 2024. But if the debt continues to grow unchecked, the BOK could delay its pivot.”— Hyosung Kwon, economistTo read the full report, click hereThe board is in lockstep with Rhee over the need to deter asset bubbles and avoid financial imbalances at a time when consumer inflationary pressure persists. Its members have been unanimous in warning for months that they’re ready to take the rate higher by another quarter-percentage-point if deemed necessary.Markets are increasingly skeptical that it will come to pass. Another hike would put more pressure on credit markets still recovering from a series of crises that included the default of a Legoland Korea developer last year and a bank run at a local credit union in the summer. At the same time, the outlook for economic growth remains precarious as exports have yet to return to growth, and industrial output is still shaky.Story continues“The lack of a dissenting vote for a hike so far leaves us skeptical of a strong consensus and willingness to take action,” Kathleen Oh, a Bank of America economist, said in a note. “Amid fading growth momentum, we think the macro environment is even less conducive for a further hike now.”There’s also growing public unease about mounting interest rate loads for households and companies. In a cabinet meeting last week, President Yoon Suk Yeol cited “interest burdens” as he spoke of jitters in global financial markets and their potential impact on Korean rates in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel.“High inflation and the increases of interest burdens will bring about a reduction in people’s real income and exert a negative influence on the economic recovery momentum,” he said, according to a transcript released by his office.The impact on oil prices from the conflict remains limited so far. But Rhee said in an interview with Bloomberg TV last week that if the conflict were to widen, and the oil price were to jump above the mid-$80 range, it would prompt the bank to readjust its growth outlook for next year.The BOK expects Korean economic growth to accelerate to 2.2% in 2024, versus the 1.4% forecast for this year. Growth prospects are increasingly becoming a focus for the BOK, Rhee has suggested, even as he’s made it clear the primary policy objective remains fighting inflation. Price growth briefly cooled at the start of the summer to the targeted 2% level, before a resurgence in August and September.The BOK began its tightening cycle in August 2021, launching its fight against inflation earlier than peers including the Federal Reserve. Some economists say the BOK may ultimately jump ahead of the Fed once again — in the opposite direction, reducing rates in the event financial and economic concerns continue to mount.“A prolonged period of elevated interest rates may increase financial stress to the point at which firms and households are unable to sustain their economic activity,” Jeong Woo Park, a Korea economist at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note. “Both households and nonfinancial corporate sectors are nearing that point.”--With assistance from Tomoko Sato.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in Tech©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo

Biden will travel to Israel on Wednesday to show his support after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas that sparked the conflict. At the same time, markets remain on edge as Israel is still making plans for a ground offensive into Gaza.Earlier, prices dropped more than 1% before paring its losses after Russia’s Central Bank reiterated expectations that OPEC+ may consider an increase in output at the beginning of 2024. Shortly afterward, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that it’s still too early to talk about what market decisions OPEC+ may take at its meeting in November.“Traders remain on high alert” while oil remains in a holding pattern, said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. “Many investors are not willing to make outright bets on crude in the current environment but are actively buying upside call options in the event crude supply is impacted. It is a low conviction, highly volatile trading environment.”Crude traders are also tracking events in Barbados, where Venezuela’s government is expected to sign a deal with the US-backed opposition later on Tuesday. In exchange for a freer presidential election next year, the agreement could pave the way for the US to ease sanctions against the country, potentially boosting oil exports.The crude market has been left on edge by the crisis in the Middle East and the risk that it spreads beyond Israel and Gaza, potentially endangering crude flows from key producers. Iran, which supports Hamas, has warned that an expansion of the war was “approaching the inevitable stage.” In addition to roiling futures markets in recent days, the conflict has also upended options pricing and sent freight costs soaring.Story continuesLooking ahead, the path of least resistance seems to be to the upside, Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at StoneX, said in a note.

Augusta Saraiva and Vince Golle,US Economic Data Keep Coming In Stronger and Defying Forecasts,"(Bloomberg) -- US retail sales exceeded all forecasts and industrial production strengthened last month, fresh evidence of a resilient American consumer whose spending is helping stabilize manufacturing.Most Read from BloombergHundreds Dead at Gaza Hospital as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportSales, unadjusted for inflation, increased 0.7% after upwardly revised advances in the prior two months, according to the Commerce Department. So-called control group sales — which are used to calculate spending on merchandise in the gross domestic product report — rose a better-than-expected 0.6%.Robust consumer demand, in the aftermath of September data showing stubborn inflation and surging job growth, risks prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. The reports prompted a slew of economists, from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, to boost their tracking estimates for third-quarter GDP.The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to the highest level since 2007, while the S&P 500 Index fell. Traders increased bets of a rate hike in the coming months and pushed bets on the first cut to later in 2024.The advance in sales illustrates a consumer who is still delivering for the economy, seemingly undaunted by high prices. Spending is being fueled by a robust labor market and defying economists’ expectations of a slowdown on the back of a retreat in pandemic-related household savings.“The death of the US consumer has been greatly exaggerated,” Omair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights LLC, said in a note. Including control group sales revisions, “this is a good all-around report that shows continued strength in consumer spending.”Control group sales, which exclude food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations, rose an annualized 6.4% in the three months through September. That’s the largest end-of-quarter advance since June 2022.Story continuesThe Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast was boosted to show the economy grew an annualized 5.4% in the third quarter, which would be the strongest since the end of 2021. Personal consumption probably increased at a 4.1% pace, the fastest since the second quarter of that same year.Resilient demand is helping to shore up the nation’s manufacturers. The Fed’s index of US industrial production rose in September to the highest level in nearly five years, led by strength in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Factory output last month was bolstered a pickup in the production of both consumer goods and construction supplies.Read More: US Industrial Production Rises to Highest in Nearly Five YearsIn the July-to-September period, industrial production was largely fueled by a surge in utility output and a pickup in mining that included higher oil and gas extraction. Manufacturing is also finding some footing as retailers make progress getting inventories more in line with demand.“The mighty US consumer continues to fuel demand and factories pushed ahead despite several headwinds (including the UAW strike),” Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.“While this may not be quite enough to move the Fed from the sidelines in November, a resilient US economy means the central bank’s job to cool the economy and restore price stability may not be done yet,” Thiagamoorthy said.Morgan Stanley economists boosted their third-quarter GDP growth forecast to 4.9% on the back of Tuesday’s data. JPMorgan now sees 4.3% and Goldman Sachs lifted its estimate to 4%.Purchases rose in eight out of 13 categories last month, including stronger receipts at restaurants, motor vehicle dealers and personal care stores, the retail sales report showed. Sales of motor vehicles jumped 1% in September, the largest gain in four months and despite higher financing rates.Purchases made at restaurants and bars — the only service-sector category in the report — increased 0.9% last month.“As long as businesses keep producing and hiring and consumers keep spending, it can be a bit of a virtuous cycle,” said Kayla Bruun, senior economist at Morning Consult LLC. “With all the headwinds from inflation and interest rates, you would think that that would break down, but it seems to be working.”While inflation is still running well above the Fed’s 2% target, the prices of key consumer goods including apparel and furniture fell sharply last month. The price declines help explain a more restrained value of receipts at clothing retailers and appliances merchants in September. Apparel store sales fell 0.8% in September, the first decline in six months.What Bloomberg Economics Says....“Solid September retail sales overstate the degree of consumer resilience.

Josh Schafer,Resilient consumer keeps pressure on Fed,"A hot jobs market is continuing to help boost consumer spending.Retail sales rose 0.7% in September from the previous month, more than double Wall Street's estimates for 0.3% growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department released on Tuesday. Retail sales have now grown from the month prior for six straight months, marking a consistent trend of consumer spending.This, economists say, has been supported by an average of nearly 270,000 nonfarm payroll additions over the same period. With no clear signs of the labor market fully cooling, the strong position of the US consumer entering the fourth quarter of 2023 could provide upside risks to inflation that's already showing signs of stickiness — and prompt more Fed rate hikes.""The economy is entering Q4 with more momentum than we previously thought,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a research note on Tuesday.

Randy Thanthong-Knight,Inflation in Canada Reverses Just in Time for Central Bank,"(Bloomberg) -- Canadian inflation is decelerating again, leaving room for the central bank to hold interest rates steady next week.Most Read from BloombergHundreds Dead at Gaza Hospital as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden ‘Deeply Saddened’ Over Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportThe consumer price index rose 3.8% in September from a year ago, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday in Ottawa, slower than the median estimate of 4% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. It’s a reversal that comes at the right time for Bank of Canada policymakers, who will soon begin their deliberations for a rate decision on Oct. 25.Governor Tiff Macklem and his officials paused rate increases in early September, saying they wanted to see how the economy evolved. A surprise second-quarter economic contraction and employment losses in July had allowed them to look past an early-summer uptick in inflation.But then the headline rate of inflation rose again in August and the economy added 104,000 jobs over August and September, while wage growth for permanent employees accelerated. That prompted some economists and traders to speculate that another hike was imminent.That pressure appears to be off, for now.Traders in overnight swaps pared their bets on another rate increase next week, falling from around 50% odds to less than 20%. Bonds rallied; the loonie fell sharply after the data release before rebounding.“The level of inflation remains much too high for comfort, but the trend is the BOC’s friend here,” Benjamin Reitzes, a rates and macro strategist at the Bank of Montreal, said in a report to investors. “Given that inflation is the most lagging of indicators, and the economy is clearly weakening, we’re likely to see ongoing disinflationary pressure.”“There’s no need for further rate hikes in Canada,” he added.Story continuesOn a monthly basis, the consumer price index fell 0.1% in September, versus expectations for an increase of 0.1%.Two key yearly inflation measures that are tracked closely by the Bank of Canada and filter out components with more volatile price fluctuations — the so-called trim and median core rates — also eased, averaging 3.8%, from 4% a month earlier.A three-month moving average of underlying price pressures that Macklem has said policymakers are tracking fell to an annualized pace of 3.67%, from 4.29% a month earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations.The unexpected deceleration in inflation doesn’t fully offset the upside surprises of the past few months, said Andrew Grantham, an economist with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.“However, with activity in the economy stalling in Q2 and Q3, excess demand appears to be diminishing, suggesting that inflation should continue to decelerate in the quarters ahead without the need for further interest rate hikes.”On Monday, the central bank’s surveys showed that both businesses and consumers believe the full impact of rate hikes has yet to be felt, though inflation expectations remain elevated.Federal Reserve policymakers are also grappling with a public view that inflation will stay well above the central bank’s target. Americans expect prices to climb at a 3.8% rate over the next year, the highest in five months, according to a survey reading from the University of Michigan. The US inflation rate was 3.7% in September, above its level in June and July.Services InflationIn September, the year-over-year deceleration in inflation was broad, stemming from lower prices for some travel-related services and durable goods. Food price increases slowed. On a monthly basis, the slowdown was driven by lower gasoline prices, Statistics Canada said. Air travel costs were also down.Goods prices fell 0.3% from a month earlier, the first such decline since December, and rose 3.6% from a year ago. The services CPI was unchanged from August, the first time it hasn’t grown on a monthly basis since November 2021, while the yearly rate slowed to 3.9%, from 4.3% in August.Overall, prices rose at a slower pace on a yearly basis compared with August in six of 10 provinces. The rate of inflation was higher in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec — provinces that saw outsized increases in gasoline prices.“The slower increase in Canadian consumer prices in September was a step in the right direction,” Claire Fan, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a report to investors. “With more easing in inflation readings expected in the months ahead, we expect the Bank of Canada to stay on pause through the rest of the year.”--With assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Danielle Bochove.(Updates with more context and commentary beginning in the third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
Ana Monteiro,"Fed Has Time to See If More Needed to Tame Inflation, Barkin Says","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said policymakers “have time” to work out whether they can hold interest rates steady or if they need to raise them further to get inflation to policymakers’ 2% goal.Most Read from BloombergHundreds Dead at Gaza Hospital as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden ‘Deeply Saddened’ Over Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls Support“I am still looking to be convinced, both that demand is settling and that any weakness is feeding through to inflation,” Barkin said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Real Estate Roundtable in Washington Tuesday.While the path for inflation “isn’t yet clear,” he said, “we have time to see if we have done enough, or whether there’s more work to do.”Noting that headline annual inflation had slowed to 3.7% in September from a peak of 9.1% in June last year, the Richmond Fed chief said “we aren’t there yet, but we’re headed in the right direction.” Barkin, who does not vote on rate decisions this year, said he supported the Federal Open Market Committee’s decision to forgo a rate hike at its September meeting so officials can gather more information to assess the effects of cumulative tightening so far.Fed officials — who have raised interest rates by more than 5 percentage points since March 2022 — have signaled they’re inclined to hold policy steady for a second time in a row next month, after a recent run-up in bond yields tightened financial conditions.Read More: Fed Officials Set to Extend Pause Without Saying Hikes Are DoneBut hikes aren’t off the table thanks to data that keep demonstrating the US economy’s resilience, including retail sales and factory output figures out earlier Tuesday.Fed officials see a number of risks — including food-price shocks and a stronger housing market — that could reignite inflation, minutes of their most recent meeting showed. Also, an expected ground war between Israel and Hamas threatens to keep energy prices elevated, feeding price growth.Story continues“We are walking a fine line — if we undercorrect, inflation re-emerges. If we overcorrect, we do unnecessary damage to the economy,” Barkin said. “And even the best policy has the potential to be waylaid by external events, as we’ve been reminded with the recent news from the Middle East.”Speaking to reporters after his speech, Barkin said that if inflation started to move up and if demand stays as strong as it’s been, “then you’d say that’s the kind of environment where you’d want to do more” through a rate hike.In projections submitted in September, 12 of 19 officials said they expect another rate increase before the end of the year. Futures markets are pricing in a less than 15% chance of a quarter-point rate increase at the November meeting, though odds of a hike by the January meeting are above 50%.Barkin’s comments echoed remarks he made on Oct. 5, when he said policymakers have time to determine if they need to do more work to cool inflation.(Updates with comment from Barkin in ninth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo

Craig Torres and Rich Miller,Fed Officials Prepare to Extend Rate Pause Without Saying Hikes Are Done,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials look set to hold interest rates steady for the second time in a row next month — but they’re far from calling an end to their tightening campaign.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Army Says Hamas Officials Dead; Over 600,000 in Gaza Flee SouthUS Pushes to Contain Israel-Hamas War, Warns Iran About EscalationIsrael Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion NearsGlobal Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East WarYour Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas WarPolicymakers across the hawk-dove spectrum have signaled in recent days that they’re inclined to forgo a rate hike at their Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting following a run-up in bond yields that has tightened financial conditions.But with data on the labor market and inflation showing an economy that’s still humming, the Federal Open Market Committee is unlikely to take further rate increases off the table.“It’s too soon to declare victory,” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who has a rotating vote on rates this year, said Tuesday during a town hall event in North Dakota.Minutes from the Fed’s September gathering released Wednesday showed policymakers see a slew of risks that could push inflation higher than they expect, including shocks to food prices, a stronger housing market and a slowdown in the decline of goods prices. An anticipated ground war between Israel and Hamas also threatens to keep energy prices elevated, which could feed into more inflation pressures.Recent economic data also highlighted a resilient economy despite the Fed raising rates more than five percentage points since March 2022.Hiring surged last month as employers added 336,000 jobs — double the number estimated by economists, and the most since the start of the year. Producer prices rose more than forecast, and core inflation excluding shelter and energy services — a measure closely watched by Chair Jerome Powell — also picked up.Story continuesThe repeated “head fakes” in the economic data will make policymakers wary of signaling an end to further tightening, said Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at JP Morgan Investment Management in New York.“Whenever they are done, I don’t think they will say they are done,” Misra said. “They will want to keep the expectation or optionality to hike.”Fed officials are increasingly focused on trying to balance the risk of overshooting — and triggering a possible recession — against the need to get inflation back to target. They’re also wary of making the same mistake as the Bank of Canada, which in June had to restart its rate-increase campaign after a conditional pause, citing “excess demand” that was more persistent than anticipated.San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly called it the hardest phase of policymaking, as officials try to communicate how they are straddling two-sided risks.“When you don’t know exactly what will be needed, it’s not actually a terrific idea to telegraph one thing or the other,” she said on Oct. 5. “We could find ourselves with data that are really accelerating, and I don’t want to be in a position where we’ve said definitively we’re not going to do X, and then X is needed.”Yield SurgeNevertheless, a fast rise in bond yields after the Sept. 19-20 policy meeting has led some officials to conclude that they can skip a hike for the second consecutive meeting as higher market rates are doing some of the work of restraint.Philip Jefferson, who as vice chair plays a key role in communicating Fed policy on behalf of Powell, said Monday he’s watching the increase in Treasury yields as a potential further brake on the economy.“Looking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields and will keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy,” he said.Yields on the US government 10-year note touched the highest levels since 2007 on Oct. 6 before closing at 4.8%. As Fed officials signaled a November hike might be off the table, yields fell back, closing the week at 4.61%.Read More: Fed Leaders See Rise in Yields as Possible Substitute for Hike“We’re in this position where we kind of watch and see what happens,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Wednesday at a conference in Park City, Utah.Others, including Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic, have gone further, saying policy is restrictive enough to guide inflation back to the central bank’s 2% goal.But such a clear signal is unlikely to come from the Fed’s policy committee.In projections submitted just last month, 12 of 19 officials said they expect another rate increase before the end of the year.While policymakers could at some point tweak their post-meeting statement — which referenced “the extent of additional policy firming” — the data haven’t yet indicated that the inflation battle is over.The last reading on the Fed’s preferred core inflation measure showed prices rose 3.9% in the 12 months through August.Communication RisksA strong signal that the rate-hiking cycle is over risks a powerful rally in stock and bond markets, inducing more consumption and growth just when Fed officials are trying to moderate demand.Households seem to believe that the inflation fight is far from convincingly won. Both short- and longer-run inflation expectations moved higher this month, a University of Michigan survey showed Friday.“They can’t signal they are done,” said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC, because it immediately sets up expectations of when the Fed will start cutting.Fed officials also see it as essential to keep a lid on inflation expectations, and have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to restoring price stability, even if it means raising rates higher than they currently expect.“Two percent is and will remain our inflation target,” Powell said in his Aug. 25 remarks at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, central bank symposium.The Fed chief is set to speak Thursday at the Economic Club of New York.Lifting the threat of further hikes could also undermine that credibility with the public, raising the risk that inflation will become entrenched.“There is a very substantial risk that they will need to do more,” said Andrew Levin, a former senior Fed adviser who’s now a professor at Dartmouth College.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Introducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google Loophole©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
Seana Smith,"'Fog on the horizon': CEOs brace for recession
A soft landing looks elusive as geopolitical risk raises bets of a recession.","Wall Street’s great debate of 2023 — whether the US economy is headed for a recession — is resurfacing amid escalating unrest in the Middle East.Heightened geopolitical risk, along with unabating inflationary pressures, surging bond yields, and the Federal Reserve’s ""higher for longer"" vision, has business leaders bracing for a contraction.“There’s a lot of fog on the horizon,” KPMG US CEO Paul Knopp told Yahoo Finance Live, citing geopolitical tensions as one of the top risks to the economy.Seventy-two percent of CEOs are preparing for a US recession over the next 12-18 months, according to The Conference Board’s survey of business leaders. While that’s an improvement from the start of the year, expectations about the short-term economic outlook have darkened.Big bank CEOs are among those weighing in on a more uncertain economic outlook.

STAN CHOE,"Even with economic worries, Vivid Seats CEO says customers still pay to see sports and hair bands","NEW YORK (AP) — Strong spending by consumers has been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession, and Vivid Seats CEO Stan Chia doesn’t see demand in his industry falling off.He says customers are still using Vivid Seats to find tickets to concerts, sporting events and the theater even if interest rates are high and sentiment surveys show shoppers say they’re feeling nervous. Vivid Seats' marketplace allows people to buy and sell their tickets to live events.Chia told The Associated Press that he believes the explosion of pent-up demand for entertainment outside the house following the pandemic has burned out, and trends have returned more to normal. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Q: It seems like the economy is riding on whether U.S. consumers can keep spending. How do you see the state of the consumer today?A: I think what we can certainly see in our category is live events continues to be one that consumers are prioritizing in their discretionary income.This category, while it is discretionary by definition, doesn’t behave like others, like buying a new TV. You don’t really think about buying a new TV in the same way as whether you’re going to a Guns N' Roses concert.We are now past any point of potential pent-up demand release. What we’re really into is secular trends of the industry that really drive it forward. I think about where the generational priority is on spending. If you think about Gen Z, as they come into purchasing power they have prioritized experiences over goods and services.You’ve got folks like myself — the Guns N' Roses references shows I'm a geriatric millennial — I’ve certainly got a little more money than I did 20 years ago, and the bands that I love are touring, and I love the opportunity to go see that.Q: Can you go back to the idea of pent-up demand? This is no longer just people hungry to go to live events again for the first time after the pandemic shutdowns?Story continuesA: Where we fit as marketplace for live events, we are a great barometer for how much demand exceeds supply.If you go back to maybe 2021, the second half of that year through the first half of 2022, you could look at where our average order size was relative to 2019, for example, and you saw really, really big jumps. That’s where you saw pent-up demand being released. Numerically, just fantastic growth of that magnitude, that’s clearly driven by pent-up demandIn the second half of 2022 and now in 2023, if you were to plot that line, we’re right back on the industry line. The consumer demand is past pent-up demand.Q: So what do you make of all these surveys where consumers say they're worried? When will they stop spending?A: I certainly read and see all the things out there about the strength of the consumer and where sentiment is, but in this category, we’ve continued to see strength.We’re headquartered in Chicago Illinois, and the example I like to give, which unfortunately is not going to be true this year, is if the Bears go to the Super Bowl, you’re going to see a lot of fans who want to go to that event. This category in particular has that FOMO-esque truth to it. That’s what continues to drive consumer purchasing.Q: Are you seeing any differences in consumer behavior? Are football fans spending more than baseball fans? Concert goers in high-income ZIP codes versus lower-income ones?A: I think fandom just traverses all categories and all demographics. You’ve got a very consistent level of intensity whether you’re talking about sports fans, concert fans, theater fans, comedy fans, down to the team level.Q: Are you worried that this year’s strength for concerts may be because of a couple of high-profile performers like Beyonce and Taylor Swift? Will next year be a regression to the mean?A: Taylor Swift and Beyonce are phenomenal artists and performers. We’re just so privileged to see them put on amazing shows this year. I think the beauty of the category is there are always amazing artists out there on tour. We’re in the fourth quarter of the year now, we’re excited to hear about the major acts that are going to be playing next year. We just heard Foo Fighters are going on tour next summer.Q: Does it bother you that one of the first search-engine results for your company is: Is it safe to buy on Vivid Seats?A: No. Until we become a household name, and we are on our way there, you’re always going to look and see who is this company. You'll find we are an award-winning customer service company with a 100% buyer guarantee and a rewards program.Q: There's a big pushback by customers against fees getting added at the last screen of a transaction online. Any possibility Vivid Seats will show prices including all fees at the first instance?A: We are so supportive of all efforts and all legislation that drive transparency in all industries. We’re going to continue to be very supportive of a competitive playing field.We understand that consumers are looking for value in what they purchase, and I think when you look at what we do – where customers who buy 10 tickets get one (more through a reward credit) — we put our money where the mouth is.",Yahoo
Ines Ferré,"Oil prices spike as G7 enforces Russian export price caps, Israel-Hamas war continues","Oil prices jumped more than 5% during Friday's session amid the Israeli-Hamas war and a clampdown by the US on Russian crude export price caps.On Friday afternoon, West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent International (BZ=F) settled at $87.69 and $90.89 per barrel, respectively.The spike comes as Israel launches counterattacks against Hamas and warns residents of northern Gaza to evacuate their homes. The Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has sparked worries of the conflict broadening to other participants, including Iran.""The oil market may be anticipating that the United States will more strictly enforce sanctions on both Russia and Iran and that will lead to a reduction of oil supplies,"" Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told Yahoo Finance on Friday.Oil is also reacting to enforcements on Russian oil exports price caps imposed by the G7 last year, aimed at limiting funds to Russia for its war against Ukraine.On Thursday the coalition said it identified the owners of vessels carrying Russian oil priced above the $60 price cap.""As a Coalition, we reiterate our strong commitment to imposing sanctions and other economic measures against Russia in response to its illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war,"" read the statement by the G7, which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.Oil has been volatile this week amid worries of a broader conflict breaking out in the Middle East following the worst assault on Israel in decades. Prices rose early in the week but fell on Wednesday amid speculation that Iran, a longtime ally of Hamas, may not have been involved in a surprise attack on Oct. 7.Targets against Iran's oil fields or a disruption of the nearby Strait of Hormuz, a major passageway for crude, would likely send crude prices higher.""I think that if evidence is found that directly connects Iran to the massacre perpetrated by Hamas, it is much more likely that Iranian military targets are struck,"" said Lipow.Story continuesThe analyst points out Iran increased its oil production to over 3.2 million barrels per day from 2 million in 2020 and has raised exports to China.""The [US] administration has turned a blind eye to these increases as they are focused on reining in gasoline prices,"" said Lipow. ""This has put the administration in a difficult position as taking oil supplies off the market will result in higher gasoline prices, which is politically unpalatable."" Gas prices are seen at a Mobil gas station in Los Angeles on Sept. 28, 2023. (ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)The Israel-Hamas conflict and US enforcements on Russian crude exports price caps come at a time when gasoline prices in the US have been declining in recent weeks.On Friday, the national average for gas in the US was at $3.62 per gallon versus $3.91 a year ago. Gasoline reached a 2023 high of $3.88 per gallon on Sept. 18 as oil was continuing to rise in price.Crude rallied an average of 28% last quarter, jumping to a yearly high on Sept. 27 as OPEC+ output cuts and further supply restraints from Saudi Arabia and Russia created a deficit in the market.Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Reade Pickert,US Consumer Inflation Expectations Jump to a Five-Month High,"(Bloomberg) -- US consumers’ year-ahead inflation expectations rose sharply in early October, driving a steep deterioration in Americans’ views of their finances as well as sentiment.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Army Strikes Hezbollah Posts in LebanonTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerIsrael Latest: Blinken Says Must Stop Conflict From SpreadingWider War in Middle East Could Tip the World Economy Into RecessionNYC Boosts Security Ahead of ‘All Out for Palestine’ ProtestAmericans expect prices will climb at a 3.8% rate over the next year, the highest in five months and up from the 3.2% expected in September, according to the preliminary October reading from the University of Michigan. They see costs rising 3% over the next five to 10 years, compared to last month’s 2.8%.The sentiment index slid more than 5 points in October to 63, the sharpest monthly decline since June of last year. The figure fell short of all but one estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.“After stabilizing earlier this year, concerns about inflation have grown again,” Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement. “About 49% of consumers reported that high prices are eroding their living standards, up substantially from 39% last month and matching the all-time high last recorded in July 2022.”The high cost of living across the country continues to depress household sentiment. The last time consumers were this pessimistic about their current finances was when inflation hit a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022.Households were most concerned about high costs of groceries and fuel. Respondents with a high school diploma or less reported a particularly sharp decline in sentiment.“If these concerns continue to grow, consumer attitudes will keep deteriorating as well,” Hsu said.Data out Thursday showed consumer prices rose at a brisk pace in September for a second month, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s intent to keep borrowing costs high to stamp out inflation.Story continuesConsumers’ views of the economy’s outlook over the next year also soured, falling 14 points — the most since May 2022 — to 60.One bright spot, buying conditions for durable goods held steady.The current conditions gauge dropped to a five-month low of 66.7 from 71.4.

Catarina Saraiva,Fed’s Harker Reiterates Call for Holding Interest Rates Steady,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said disinflation is under way and reiterated that he favors holding interest rates where they are, barring a sharp change in data.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Army Strikes Hezbollah Posts in LebanonTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerWider War in Middle East Could Tip the World Economy Into RecessionNYC Boosts Security Ahead of ‘All Out for Palestine’ ProtestCanada’s Supreme Court Voids Most of Trudeau Environment Law“I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are,” Harker said in a virtual event with the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. “By doing nothing, we are still doing something. And, actually, we are doing quite a lot.”Harker said economic and financial conditions are evolving a bit better than he had expected, with prices cooling and labor-market tightness unwinding.“I am sure policy rates are restrictive, and as long they remain so, we will steadily press down on inflation and bring markets into a better balance,” Harker said.The Fed has been carefully calibrating policy this year after sharply increasing interest rates in 2022 and policymakers have said they’ll need to keep rates high for a long time to cool inflation.Officials held rates at their meeting last month while signaling that they’d likely deliver another increase this year. Now, with two more meetings to go, some policymakers have said that a run-up in bond yields since the September decision may obviate the need for further tightening.At the same time, an unexpected increase in the September consumer price index may renew pressure on Fed officials, who are determined to fully bring inflation down to their 2% goal. Harker noted the uptick in the CPI but said he’s focused on how data performs over a few months.“First, we will not tolerate a reacceleration in prices,” Harker said. “But second, I do not want to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices.”Story continuesHe said he’s prepared to adjust policy “either way” should the economic picture change, noting several risks including labor strikes, higher oil prices, the possibility of a government shutdown and the resumption of student-loan payments.In August, at the Fed’s annual policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Harker signaled support for keeping rates where they were and assessing later whether more tightening would be needed.The Philadelphia Fed chief said the significant increase in debt-service costs is putting “real pressure” on the US budget deficit, adding that analysis by researchers at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania shows that the point where this becomes a problem is “not that far off.”“We need to deal with it,” he said.(Updates with comment on deficit in penultimate paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Business Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded Programs©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
Hamza Shaban,The Fed's next 'rate hike' has already arrived,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsAnother interest rate increase is creeping its way through the economy. But this time it didn’t come from the Federal Reserve. Spooky season is upon us, and so is the phantom rate hike.The recent surge in Treasury yields has unleashed an array of anxiety goblins, from fears of a stock market slump to worries about ballooning interest payments on government debt.But policymakers also see rising yields as a way to slow the economy without having to go through the trouble of raising rates again.In effect, elevated yields can do the work of central bankers for them — functioning as a rate hike without instituting an actual rate hike.This isn't the only time recently where we've seen a phantom rate hike. In March Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the bank failures and associated turmoil essentially acted as another rate hike.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsLong-term Treasury yields have a direct influence on households and businesses. They impact the cost of mortgages, car loans, and taking on other types of debt. So increasing yields have a tightening effect, slowing economic activity.Though it's receded this week, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) has risen to levels last seen in 2007, climbing roughly 30 basis points since the Fed’s meeting in September.Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson pointed to the rise in yields and their impact in a speech earlier this week, pledging to ""remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields ... as I assess the future path of policy.""Jefferson said that the Fed is in a particularly sensitive period of managing risk, having to balance between the twin risks of too loose and too tight.Story continuesOther Fed officials have chimed in on the bond market acting like a pinch-hitter.“We're just kind of keeping a very close eye on that, and then we'll see how these higher rates feed into what we're trying to do in policy,” said Fed Governor Chris Waller on Wednesday.But as with the Fed’s previous rate increases, a rise in inflation or other unfavorable observations could force the central bank to move. And if yields slide, their tightening effect would diminish, creating a greater need for the Fed to enact a genuine hike instead of relying on a substitute.There’s a circular logic to all of this, which means it can turn on a dime.As Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said earlier this week, it’s possible higher bond yields will mean less work for the Fed. But if those yields are higher because the market’s expectations for the Fed are changing, the Fed might have to follow through on those expectations to keep those yields high.In other words, there's a wobbly Jenga tower of expectations.“It’s hard for me to say definitively that because they moved, we don’t have to move,” Kashkari said. “I don’t know yet.”For now, as some Fed officials think the focus of the tightening campaign should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels, the latest data might support more of a let-the-bond-market-do-the-work approach.While the likelihood of a rate hike next month has fallen, that may be because one has already come through. It just didn’t come from the Fed.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

"Ignacio Olivera Doll, Carolina Gonzalez and Manuela Tobias",Argentina Central Bank Hikes Rate to 133% on Inflation Data,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s central bank sharply raised its key rate Thursday for the sixth time this year in an effort to contain inflation as price gains continue accelerating above 100% before a presidential election.Most Read from BloombergTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerIsrael Latest: UN Staff Given Evacuation Order for Northern GazaIsrael Latest: Mideast Rallies Grow as Gaza Crisis WorsensVideo Game Cyberpunk 2077 Uses AI To Replace Deceased Voice ActorJeff Bezos Buys His Florida Neighbor’s Mansion for $79 MillionThe monetary authority raised its key rate 15 percentage points to 133%, according to a statement. The move came after September inflation data published Thursday showing prices rose 138.3% from a year ago, the fastest pace since the early 1990s when Argentina was exiting hyperinflation. It also comes after officials hiked rates 21 percentage points in August.Read More: Argentina’s Black Market Peso Rate Tops 1,000 Per Dollar (1)The central bank made the decision to move the benchmark rate based on a sharp selloff in Argentina’s black market exchange rate in recent days, according to two officials with direct knowledge. The “dollar blue” rate touched a record low of 1,040 pesos per dollar on Tuesday. As recently as Monday the central bank planned to hold the key rate, according to people with direct knowledge of the deliberations who asked not to be identified.A central bank spokesperson said the bank does not comment on rate decisions ahead of time nor on policy discussions.Economists said the rate hike won’t do much to cool inflation because it’s coupled with money printing to finance government spending and still falls below inflation in real terms.“The government is trying to gain time and, unfortunately, this does not solve anything. The effect will be almost nil,” said Alejo Costa, chief Argentina strategist at Banco Btg Pactual in Buenos Aires.“This is like breaking both legs and then wanting to put a Band-Aid on it,” said Gabriel Caamano, economist at Buenos Aires-based Consultora Ledesma.Story continuesDespite one of the world’s highest monetary policy rates, inflation continues to surge in the country largely lacking credit as the Oct. 22 election unnerves markets and population at large.Front runner candidate Javier Milei earlier this week encouraged Argentines to stop saving in pesos as he’s promising dollarization — replacing the national currency with US greenbacks. His comments drew sharp criticism from investors, banks and politicians who accused him of exacerbating the selloff.The Argentine peso has suffered sharp losses in recent weeks, with the black market exchange rate weakening about 20% so far in October. Economy Minister Sergio Massa, who is the incumbent coalition’s presidential candidate, has frozen the official exchange rate at 350 until the election.(Adds comment from central bank officials and economists in third-sixth paragraphs)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
Paige Hagy,"Best Buy CEO Corie Barry says we’re in the ‘funflation’ economy with $1,000 Taylor Swift tickets—and it’s why sales are worse than expected","Forget inflation. Best Buy’s CEO says we’re living in a ""funflation"" economy—and it’s hurting her business.“‘Funflation,’ Taylor Swift…those experiences are really where people are willing to pay,” Corie Barry said at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit in Dana Point, Calif., adding that this “means the bigger ticket items in electronics are not right now where people are interested.”Best Buy’s sales boomed during the pandemic, as workers invested in electronics for their remote work setups and entertainment, Barry said. Now business has slowed down as consumers spend on increasingly expensive necessities, like food and fuel, or luxuries denied during lockdown, like concerts and vacations.As a result, Barry says, Best Buy’s televisions and PCs are being pushed to the back burner. This was evident as electronics sales cooled more than expected during second-quarter earnings. Other sectors including appliances, pet supplies, and home improvement are also being hit by the recent consumer trend, Barry said.What is ‘funflation’? The term is a mashup of the words “fun” and “inflation,” to state the obvious—but it speaks to the curious spending habits that have been befuddling economists for years now. In short, higher demand for fun experiences drives higher prices for fun experiences. After years of being locked down, American consumers have been eager to get out of the house and splurge on items like Taylor Swift concert tickets, Barbie in theaters, and airline tickets.For instance, Swifties spared no expense for the Eras tour, spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on tickets and costumes, Fortune’s Alicia Adamczyk reported in March.This has also been called a “YOLO economy,” in which consumers use the mantra “You only live once” to justify their purchases. The term ""revenge spending"" has come into use as well, with Delta CEO Ed Bastian referring to the fun-seeking phenomenon as “revenge travel” and saying it’s a $300 billion market opportunity.Story continues“People talk about revenge travel, or pent-up travel—this is beyond anything that people can classify as truly pent-up,” Bastian said on Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast in June. “We went through several years of people not being able to get back out and travel and experience and see loved ones, see their business colleagues, adventures—all the reasons we travel. And people had a lot of time.”Something’s gotta give Overall, consumers have remained shockingly resilient this past year, despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in a bid to dodge a recession. People are splurging even as prices for housing, fuel, and groceries surge. Not to mention that student loan payments are back, further stretching millions of U.S. households.Their continued spending has been buoyed by savings left over from the government’s $4.6 trillion stimulus package, and a job market that “defies expectations” with low unemployment rates and hundreds of thousands of open jobs, according to Barry. But something has to give. For today’s American consumer, that means “nice to have” discretionary items.Best Buy isn’t alone. Target also pointed to Swift and the Barbie movie when its first quarterly sales dropped for the first time in six years.But “funflation” shows no signs of stopping, and retailers will need to innovate to get customers’ attention again. For Best Buy and Barry, that means relying on the intensifying integration of technology with daily life.“The greatest thing about our industry is innovation,” Barry said. “So yes, right now people are pulling back, but the future will only be more enabled by technology, and we are the ones that know how to commercialize that new tech better than anyone.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo
Will Daniel,The inflation report just wasn’t very dramatic. Cue a range of wildly varying takes on Wall Street,"The latest inflation report just came in slightly above Wall Street’s consensus forecast, stoking debate among experts about the potential for more persistent consumer price increases than expected. As measured by the consumer price index, inflation rose 0.4% in September and 3.7% from a year ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday. That’s compared with a consensus Street estimate for an increase of 0.3% and 3.6%, respectively.Over the past 18 months, as the Federal Reserve battled inflation with interest rate hikes, economists have routinely warned that one of the key threats to the U.S. is “sticky” price increases. Inflation acts like a weight on the back of consumers and businesses; and when it persists for too long (or “sticks”), it can force Fed officials to raise interest rates to a point where a job-killing recession becomes unavoidable. Citi’s chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst, who believes a recession will hit the U.S. in the first half of 2024, explained in a Thursday note that he fears September’s inflation report was evidence of this type of sticky inflation.“Today’s inflation report is likely raising concern for Fed officials that signaled strongly earlier this week they may be finished raising rates. Rather than returning to 2% we have instead new evidence that inflation is stuck closer to 4%,” the Wall Street veteran wrote, warning that shelter inflation may be here to stay because rising mortgage rates haven’t slashed home prices as anticipated.Bank of America economists, led by U.S. economist Stephen Juneau, also argued Thursday that the latest CPI report is a concern for the Fed as it seeks to tame inflation without sparking a recession. They pointed to key areas that could be indicative of the need for further rate hikes, including the 1.5% increase in energy prices during September and “sticky” core services inflation—a category that includes a mix of components like tuition prices and shelter, transportation, and medical service costs.Story continues“In short, the report reminded us that the path to 2% inflation is unlikely to be smooth sailing and the Fed must continue to err on the side of doing too much rather than too little,” the Bank of America economists wrote.Of course, as is typically the case in this era of economic confusion, when sudden wars, pandemics, and technological advancements can throw off even the best of prognosticators, the most important takeaway from the latest inflation report really depends on who you ask.Some experts noted that core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices and is more closely watched by the Fed, matched Wall Street’s expectations in September, rising just 0.3% during the month and 4.1% from a year ago.Rick Rieder, a Wall Street heavyweight who currently serves as BlackRock’s CIO of global fixed income and head of the BlackRock global allocation investment team, explained that many market watchers have been particularly focused on the often volatile—and lately negative—monthly movements of the consumer price index, but he’s more focused on the positive long-term trend.“All of this excitement belies the fact that—broadly speaking—inflation has been making a seemingly durable downward trend, while at the same time the labor market has remained remarkably resilient,” he said Thursday. “We think the Fed is likely on hold for the time being, as it awaits more data, with the possibility of a final rate hike at year-end.”Some more bullish economists also pointed out that shelter costs accounted for half of inflation’s rise in September, despite the housing market struggling under the weight of the Fed’s rate hikes. The index for shelter prices, which makes up roughly one-third of the total CPI, rose 0.6% last month and 7.2% from a year ago.Ed Yardeni, founder of the sell-side consulting firm Yardeni Research and another Wall Street legend, noted Thursday that if you exclude shelter costs from September’s inflation data, both the headline and core figures rose just 2% on a 12-month basis, matching the Fed’s target.But why exclude shelter prices from the inflation calculation? Some argue that because home prices have risen less than 1% since June 2022, according to the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, it makes sense to discount the shelter category slightly when measuring consumer price increases. However, rent prices in U.S. cities have jumped more than 7% since last September, according to Fed data, which has left some experts concerned that we could still see a consistent rise in overall shelter prices.Yardeni lands in the bulls’ camp in this shelter argument—and when it comes to the debate over the path ahead for inflation.“Wage inflation is more persistent, but moderating. Rent inflation is stickier, but also moderating. Today's CPI report for September mostly confirms our assessment,” he wrote in a Thursday note. “Price inflation is turning out to be transitory after all.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo
Steve Matthews and Jonnelle Marte,What Fed Officials Are Saying About Rising Bond Yields,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials are grappling with a run-up in bond yields since they last met in September that could obviate the need for further interest-rate hikes — and also threatens to derail a soft landing.Most Read from BloombergTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerIsrael Latest: UN Staff Given Evacuation Order for Northern GazaIsrael Latest: Army Urges Evacuation in Gaza; Mideast ProtestsVideo Game Cyberpunk 2077 Uses AI To Replace Deceased Voice ActorScalise Ends House Speaker Bid, Deepening Republican TurmoilAfter signaling one more rate hike was likely this year, policymakers in recent days have said the path is less clear, as they parse the reasons behind a surge in US 10-year Treasury yields that has led to tighter financial conditions. In the meantime, several officials have suggested the US central bank can hold off on raising rates at their next gathering on Oct. 31-Nov. 1, remarks that bond markets cheered.Here’s what Fed officials have said about rising yields:Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson2023 voter: Yes, permanentLeans: CentristPhilip Jefferson, who as vice chair plays a key role in communicating Fed policy on behalf of Chair Jerome Powell, said Monday he’s watching the increase in Treasury yields as a potential further restraint on the economy even though the rate of inflation remains too high. Jefferson said the central bank needs to balance the risk of not tightening enough with the risk that policy would become too restrictive.“Looking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields and will keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy.”Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan2023 voter: Yes, rotatingLeans: HawkishLorie Logan, a former New York Fed official, said Monday the recent surge in long-term Treasury yields may mean less need for the US central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate again. If higher yields reflect investors’ waning appetite to take risks rather than reflecting stronger economic growth, that means that financial conditions are tighter than they would be otherwise, she said.Story continues“Financial conditions have tightened notably in recent months,” she said. “But the reasons for the tightening matter. If long-term interest rates remain elevated because of higher term premiums, there may be less need to raise the fed funds rate.”San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly2023 voter: NoLeans: DovishMary Daly said Tuesday that higher yields could take the place of monetary policy tightening, which the majority of policymakers signaled as a preferred path of rates at their September meeting. Daly has said that the central bank can keep interest rates steady if the labor market continues to cool and inflation heads toward the Fed’s 2% target.“Recently, bond yields have tightened, meaning financial conditions have tightened,” she said. “If that’s tight, maybe the Fed doesn’t need to do as much. That’s why I said, depending on whether it unravels, or whether the momentum in the economy changes, that could be equivalent to another rate hike.”Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari2023 voter: Yes, rotatingLeans: HawkishNeel Kashkari said Tuesday he wasn’t yet convinced that a surge in long-term Treasury yields would lessen the need for further rate hikes, saying it depends on what is driving the recent rise in borrowing costs. He called the recent run-up in yields perplexing, and said it may be driven by growing optimism about the economy over the next five to 10 years or higher US government borrowing.“It’s certainly possible that higher long-term yields may do some of the work for us in terms of bringing inflation back down,” Kashkari said. “But if those higher long-term yields are higher because their expectation about what we’re going to do has changed, then we might actually need to follow through on their expectations in order to maintain those yields.”Fed Governor Christopher Waller2023 voter: Yes, permanentLeans: HawkishChristopher Waller, who has been among the most hawkish policymakers, said Wednesday the central bank can watch and see what happens before taking further action with interest rates as financial markets tighten. Waller noted the recent rise in yields, and said tighter financial conditions stemming from the bank crisis in March amounted to “a rate hike in and of itself,” though the broader credit crunch that some expected never materialized.“Now, once again, financial markets are tightening up and they are going to do some of the work for us.”Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester2023 voter: NoLeans: HawkishLoretta Mester said Oct. 3 that higher Treasury yields would lead to tighter financial conditions if sustained and are going to factor in to whether she sees a need to raise the federal funds rate further. She said rates might be rising because of stronger growth, along with concerns about the federal budget or fiscal spending.“We raised the funds rate intending sort of to change financial conditions and tighten financial conditions,” she said. “We’ve seen that 10-year rate go up quite a bit since, even since the last meeting. So that’s certainly going to feed into whether we think we need to, or whether I think we need to, raise the funds rate again. If it’s sustained, then that’s a tighter financial condition that will help moderate growth and moderate demand, bringing it into better balance with supply. So that’s certainly a factor I look at.”Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic2023 voter: NoLeans: DovishRaphael Bostic has been among the most dovish policymakers this year, making the case that the Fed has done enough to bring inflation back to the central bank’s 2% target. Asked about yields Tuesday in an event with bankers, he said rates are “clearly” restrictive, the economy is slowing down and more impacts from the Fed’s increases have yet to come.“I don’t think we need to do anything more in terms of interest rates,” Bostic said. “Interest rates are restrictive. Inflation is coming down. And if you want to have a measure of the degree of our restrictiveness, you compare what our interest rate is to what the rate of inflation is. And if our interest rate is higher than that, then we’re definitely, in real terms, putting a bind on the economy.”Boston Fed President Susan Collins2023 voter: NoLeans: CentristSusan Collins said Thursday that if the rise in long-term yields is “sustained,” it could lower the necessity for more rate increases in the near term. The Fed official said Treasury yields, mortgage rates and corporate bond yields are all “somewhat higher” than they were in mid-September. Collins has said she is among the officials who in September saw the need for another rate increase this year, and made it clear this week that further tightening is not off the table.“Importantly, the rise in long-term yields implies some tightening of financial conditions,” Collins said. “If it persists, it likely reduces the need for further monetary policy tightening in the near term. This reinforces my view that we are very near, and perhaps at, the peak” federal funds rate for this tightening cycle, she said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo

Policymakers noted that the risks of overtightening now had to be balanced against keeping inflation on a downward path toward 2%, according to minutes of the September meeting released Wednesday.Several policymakers speaking over the past week have said that higher long-term yields may slow the economy, potentially taking the place of additional rate increases from the US central bank.Inflation data released Thursday showed US consumer prices advanced at a brisk pace for a second month, suggesting the Fed will keep the door open to another interest-rate hike this year. The so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs, increased 0.3% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Collins, who does not vote in monetary policy decisions this year, said a key question for policymakers is whether the declines seen in inflation will continue. “Today’s CPI release is a reminder that restoring price stability will take time,” she said.The Boston Fed president repeated comments she made on Wednesday about how the Fed can take a more patient approach to monetary policy now that rates are likely close to, and potentially at, the peak rate of the tightening cycle.

Josh Schafer,Fed can stay 'patient' after inflation data as odds rise on a December rate hike,"Thursday's inflation report showed prices in September rose at roughly the same pace seen in August.But when removing volatile categories like food, energy, and shelter, economists see a downward trend in price increases, a welcomed sign for a Federal Reserve that had spent the days ahead of this data indicating a bias against raising interest rates again in November.Still, this data shows the Fed has work to do in bringing inflation back to its 2% target, keeping the possibility of an interest rate increase in December in focus for investors.As of Thursday morning, markets were pricing in a 12% chance the Fed hikes in November, down from a 41% chance a month ago, data from the CME Group showed. The chances of a December rate hike rose, however, to 37% from 26% following the September inflation reading.""The underlying trend in inflation is still down,"" wrote Michael Pearce, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, in reaction to Thursday's release. ""This report will not change the message from Fed officials over recent days that they can afford to be patient."" Economists at Citi also flagged shelter as a potential issue moving forward, noting that the 0.56% increase in owner's equivalent rent was the strongest monthly gain since February.""The acceleration in owner's equivalent rent to the strongest monthly reading since February is contrary to Fed and consensus expectations for a steady slowing,"" Citi's chief US economist Andrew Hollenhorst wrote in a note on Thursday.Stocks were mixed following the report while bond yields tracked slightly higher.""The long-awaited drop in shelter costs (rents) still hasn't arrived despite the indicators,"" Charles Schwab chief fixed income strategist Kathy Jones posted to X on Thursday.""Markets are likely to be cautious until it happens.""Read more inflation coverage:Inflation: Consumer prices rose 3.7% over last year in September, matching August's increaseStock open flat as CPI inflation holds steady: Stock market news todayGas price increases eased but still 'major contributor' to September inflation printHousing costs again frustrate the Fed’s efforts to curb inflationJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo
Ines Ferré,Gas price increases eased but still 'major contributor' to September inflation print,"Gas price increases eased in September from the previous month, a positive sign for the Federal Reserve in its battle against inflation.The gasoline index increased 2.1% in September, a slowdown from the 10.6% month-over-month rise in August. On a year-over-year basis, gasoline prices rose 3% in September.The national retail average for gasoline reached a 2023 high of $3.88 per gallon on Sept. 18. Yet prices have been retreating since then.As of Thursday, drivers at the pump were paying a national average of $3.65 per gallon, though Western states saw higher amounts. The average in California was $5.70, according to AAA. The CPI's energy index has been volatile on a month-over-month basis as oil jumped an average of about 28% in the third quarter of this year. Output cuts by OPEC+, the world's largest oil producers and their allies, along with unilateral reductions from Saudi Arabia, helped elevate oil prices.On Sept. 27, crude reached a 2023 high with West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) surpassing $93 per barrel and Brent International (BZ=F) futures rising above $96 per barrel.Story continuesPrices have pulled back since then. On Thursday, WTI futures traded above $84 per barrel while Brent hovered above $87.On Monday oil surged more than 4% following a surprise attack on Israel by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, fueling worries of broader conflict breaking out in the Middle East region.Read more inflation coverage: Inflation: Consumer prices rose 3.7% over last year in September, matching August's increaseStock open flat as CPI inflation holds steady: Stock market news todayFed can stay 'patient' after inflation data as odds rise on a December rate hikeHousing costs again frustrate the Fed’s efforts to curb inflationInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Alicia Adamczyk,"Retirees’ Social Security cost-of-living adjustment will officially be less than half of last year’s, even though many seniors still haven’t recovered from inflation","Retirees and other beneficiaries will receive a 3.2% cost-of-living adjustment for their 2024 Social Security payments, less than half of this year's increase as inflation has cooled.This comes after beneficiaries received the largest COLA increase in 40 years this year, with payments increasing 8.7%, or over $140 per check, on average. Next year, the average beneficiary will receive an additional $50 a month.Around 71 million people receive Social Security payments each month, including for retirement and disability benefits.The COLA is an annual adjustment to Social Security benefits to ensure that they keep up with inflation. It is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W, a more general inflation measure than the headline Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, or CPI-U.Though it's less than the COLA for the past two years, next year's bump is actually more in line with the historical average increase, says Mike Lynch, managing director of applied insights Hartford Funds. For the past two decades, the average COLA has been 2.6%. In more recent years, it has been as low as 0%.Most elderly Americans depend on the monthly federal benefits, particularly those who are low-income. Many do not have other savings or sources of income to fall back on. Poverty among elderly Americans rose precipitously in 2022: The share of people over 65 living in poverty grew to 14.1% last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That's up from 9.5% in 2020.For those who aren't retired yet, Lynch hopes the annual COLA announcement is a reminder to make a plan for retirement and save for it outside of Social Security. While other generations could rely on pensions in addition to Social Security, most people in the current day cannot.""Retirement is really different than it was for other generations,"" says Lynch, noting that it is often longer as people live longer lives. ""Focus on Social Security, but also on all the other sources of income as well. We really have got to try to do everything we can from a personal savings perspective.""Story continuesLynch advises near-retirees and retirees alike to spend some time on SSA.gov, the Social Security Administration's website. It's a great resource, he says, that can help people better plan out their retirements.The Social Security COLA over the past 10 years:2024: 3.2%2023: 8.7%2022: 5.9%2021: 1.3%2020: 1.6%2019: 2.8%2018: 2.0%2017: 0.3%2016: 0%2015: 1.7%Beneficiaries will see the adjustment reflected in their January 2024 payments.Inflation may be moderating, but many seniors and others on fixed incomes have still not recovered financially after two years of painful price increases. Some have delayed retirement or gone back to work to stay afloat; others have tried to cut back on their expenses. Health care costs are especially onerous.While the 3.2% boost will be welcome by many, Social Security benefits have lost over 30% of their purchasing power since 2000, according to nonprofit the Senior Citizens League, due in large part to “inadequate COLAs.” Next year's increase will do little to solve that problem.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo

The overall CPI climbed 0.4%, higher than expected, boosted by energy costs.Read more: US Consumer Prices Rise at Brisk Pace for Second Straight MonthBoth increases are consistent with an annual pace well above the Fed’s 2% goal.“This will keep the Fed open to another rate hike, though admittedly the market might end up doing the tightening for them,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.Bostjancic was referring to a recent surge in long-term Treasury yields. That’s prompted some policymakers to suggest they may hold off on another hike when they meet on Oct. 31-Nov. 1, as they parse the reasons behind the run-up.Treasury yields rose following the latest price report, as traders saw roughly 50-50 chances of a hike by year’s end.Fed policymakers agreed last month that policy should remain restrictive for some time, while noting that the risks of overtightening now had to be balanced against keeping inflation on a downward path toward 2%, according to minutes of the September meeting released Wednesday.The CPI report showed a step-up in prices for services, which has been a particular concern of Fed officials led by Chair Jerome Powell, because they see the sector’s inflation as driven in part by a tight labor market.Story continuesExcluding housing and energy, services prices climbed 0.6% from August, the most in a year, according to Bloomberg calculations.“It boils down to services,” said Jay Bryson, Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist. “The last mile to get us back down to 2% on a sustained basis, that is tough. That is why the Fed will remain restrictive for quite some time to make sure that does come down.”Fed officials are trying to decide whether they need to hike their benchmark lending rate again after raising it by more than five percentage points over the last 19 months.They left the rate unchanged at their last policy meeting in September, though 12 out of 19 officials signaled they would support another rate increase this year, according to projections released at the meeting.Yet central bankers’ emphasis on patience means it will take additional data to persuade the majority of the need for another hike.“They’re pretty set on proceeding carefully and letting patience guide their thinking, so I wouldn’t count on a fourth-quarter hike unless the urgency ramps up with more data,” said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.--With assistance from Marien Lopez-Medina and Vince Golle.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
Alexandra Canal,"Inflation: Consumer prices rose 3.7% over last year in September, matching August's increase","Inflation moderated in September as energy price increases eased from the previous month and used car prices continued to decline, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed inflation rose 0.4% over last month and 3.7% over the prior year on a headline basis in September, a deceleration from August's 0.6% month-over-month increase and in line with August's 3.7% annual rise.Both measures were slightly higher than economist forecasts for a 0.3% month-over-month increase and a 3.6% annual increase, according to data from Bloomberg.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in September climbed 4.1% over last year — a slowdown from the 4.3% annual increase seen in August.

FATIMA HUSSEIN,Social Security benefits will increase by 3.2% in 2024 as inflation moderates,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Social Security recipients will get a 3.2% increase in their benefits in 2024, far less than this year's historic boost and reflecting moderating consumer prices.The cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, means the average recipient will receive more than $50 more every month beginning in January, the Social Security Administration said Thursday. The AARP estimated that increase at $59 per month.“This will help millions of people keep up with expenses,” said Kilolo Kijakazi, Social Security’s acting commissioner.About 71 million people — including retirees, disabled people and children — receive Social Security benefits.Thursday's announcement follows this year’s 8.7% benefit increase, brought on by record 40-year-high inflation, which pushed up the price of consumer goods. With inflation easing, the next annual increase is markedly smaller.“Compared to last year's 8.7% increase, this is going to feel small and the perception is that its not keeping up with the inflation and the higher costs that retirees are still seeing,” said Martha Shedden, president of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts.On top of that, an anticipated increase in Medicare premiums for 2024 will eat into the Social Security cost-of-living bump.Medicare hasn’t announced the increase for traditional Medicare, but said the cost of Medicare Advantage plans is expected to remain stable.Still, senior advocates applauded the annual Social Security adjustment.“Retirees can rest a little easier at night knowing they will soon receive an increase in their Social Security checks to help them keep up with rising prices,” AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins said. “We know older Americans are still feeling the sting when they buy groceries and gas, making every dollar important.""Social Security is financed by payroll taxes collected from workers and their employers. The maximum amount of earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes will be $168,600 for 2024, up from $160,200 for 2023.Story continuesRetirees whose sole income comes from Social Security are not subject to taxes on that income.Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the social insurance program, said that the COLA is a “reminder of Social Security’s unique importance"" and that “Congress should pass legislation to protect and expand benefits.”However, the program faces a severe financial shortfall in the coming years.The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in March said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2033. If the trust fund is depleted, the government will be able to pay only 77% of scheduled benefits, the report said.There have been legislative proposals to shore up Social Security, but they have not made it past committee hearings.A March poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that most U.S. adults are opposed to proposals that would cut into Medicare or Social Security benefits, and 79% of people polled said they oppose reducing the size of Social Security benefits.The Social Security Administration is still without a permanent leader. President Joe Biden in July nominated former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley to lead the agency.The COLA is calculated according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, or CPI. But there are calls for the agency to instead use a different index, the CPI-E, which measures price changes based on the spending patterns of the elderly, like health care, food and medicine costs.Any change to the calculation would require congressional approval. But with decades of inaction on Social Security and with the House at a standstill after the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., seniors and their advocates say they don’t have confidence any sort of change will be approved soon.The cost of living adjustments will have a big impact on people like Alfred Mason, an 83-year-old Louisiana resident. Mason said that “any increase is welcomed, because it sustains us for what we are going through.”As inflation is still high, he said, anything added to his income “would be greatly appreciated.”",Yahoo
Laura Curtis,Accelerating US Core Inflation Set to Muddy Rate Picture for Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- A monthly report on US consumer prices due Thursday is set to muddy the picture for Federal Reserve officials trying to decide whether to hike interest rates again, especially as escalating conflict in the Middle East adds uncertainty, according to Bloomberg Economics.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: US to Offer Citizens Charter Flights From IsraelIsrael Latest: Hamas Leaders Targeted as Ground War LoomsApollo CEO Marc Rowan Demands UPenn Leaders Quit Over ‘Antisemitism’Goldman Sues Malaysia as 1MDB Settlement Dispute EscalatesIMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealThe consumer price index will probably show that headline inflation moderated in September. But core inflation — which excludes food and energy categories — likely crept up to between 3% and 4% on an annualized basis, thanks to a jump in used-car prices, Bloomberg economists Anna Wong and Stuart Paul wrote Wednesday in a preview of the release.“If the risks between inflation and growth have become more balanced in the past few months, the Israel-Hamas conflict has now tipped the balance once again toward upside inflation risks – just as pandemic supply bottlenecks have subsided,” Wong and Paul said.“Our baseline is for the Fed to hold rates steady for the rest of the year, but we see non-negligible risks of another rate hike, something the market is probably underpricing.”Read More: US PREVIEW: September CPI to Sow Doubt About Fed Rate CourseSlowing core inflation over the summer had raised hopes that the Fed would cease rate increases after lifting the target range for its benchmark in July to 5.25% to 5.5%. But high gasoline prices pushed the August reading up 0.6% from the prior month — the most since inflation peaked at a four-decade high in June 2022 — and core CPI accelerated on a monthly basis for the first time since May.Here’s what the Bloomberg economists expect:Year-over-year CPI inflation will fall to 3.6% from 3.7%, with annual core inflation decreasing to 4.1% from 4.3% prior.Goods inflation driven by used-car prices will be biggest contributor to the core CPI climb, reversing a three-month trend of negative readings.Inflation will remain sticky in some core services categories, such as car insurance, and physician and hospital services.There will be some good news on rents, however. Bloomberg Economics estimates the inflation of primary residential rents moderated to 0.4% from 0.5% and owner-equivalent rent inflation held steady at 0.4%.Story continuesWong and Paul warned increasing tensions in the Middle East may spur supply shocks and boost energy prices. If oil prices reach $100 a barrel, for example, headline CPI inflation could reach 4% by the end of this year, the economists said.“As long as inflation expectations appear to be anchored, the Fed likely will look through the price increase,” Wong and Paul wrote. “However, a sustained and larger oil shock could increase the risk that inflation expectations un-anchor, ultimately pushing the Fed to continue hiking rates.”Read More: Used Cars, Airfares Risk Slowing US Inflation’s Future DescentTheir predictions for the September report are in line with median estimates in a Bloomberg survey of outside forecasters.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo

AMY BETH HANSON and HALELUYA HADERO,TikTok and content creators challenging Montana's ban face off with the state in federal court,"MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — TikTok and Montana faced off in federal court on Thursday in a case filed by the video sharing app and five Montana content creators who want the court to temporarily block the state’s ban on the platform before it takes effect Jan. 1.Attorneys for TikTok and the content creators argued that the state has gone “completely overboard” in trying to regulate TikTok and is essentially trying to implement its own foreign policy over unproven concerns that TikTok might share user data with the Chinese government.Christian Corrigan, the state’s solicitor general, said Montana’s law was less a statement of foreign policy and rather addresses “serious, widespread concerns about data privacy.”U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy said he would rule on the motion for a preliminary injunction as quickly as possible.In May, Montana became the first state in the U.S. to pass a complete ban on the app, based on the argument that the Chinese government could gain access to user information from TikTok, whose parent company, ByteDance, is based in Beijing.TikTok has said in court filings that the state passed its law based on “unsubstantiated allegations,” and that the state could have limited the kinds of data TikTok could collect rather than enacting a complete ban. Meanwhile, the content creators say the ban violates free speech rights and could cause economic harm for their businesses.Ambika Kumar, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in the Montana lawsuit, argued Thursday that the ban shutters a “forum for communication” that creators use to express themselves or make a living, and violates the First Amendment. She also said the state is relying on news articles to back its case and hasn’t produced facts to support its allegations regarding ties between TikTok and the Chinese government.Judge Molloy's questions and comments seemed to weigh in favor of the plaintiffs. He noted that TikTok users consent to the company’s data collection policies and that Attorney General Austin Knudsen could create public service announcements warning people about the data TikTok collects.Story continuesThe judge noted that everything Knudsen has said about the ban at hearings and in public statements “are directed to ‘we are going to teach China a lesson,’ not, ‘we are going to protect Montana data.’”Knudsen's office drafted the bill that blocked TikTok. He had also testified at a legislative hearing that TikTok is controlled by an existential threat to the U.S., that China sees war with the U.S. as inevitable and that it was using TikTok as an initial salvo in that war.Western governments have expressed worries that the popular social media platform could put sensitive data in the hands of the Chinese government or be used as a tool to spread misinformation. Chinese law allows the government to order companies to help it gather intelligence.TikTok, which is negotiating with the federal government over its future in the U.S., has denied those allegations but that hasn't made the issue go away.In a first-of-its kind report on Chinese disinformation released last month, the U.S. State Department alleged that ByteDance seeks to block potential critics of Beijing, including those outside of China, from using its platforms.The report said the U.S. government had information as of late 2020 that ByteDance “maintained a regularly updated internal list” identifying people who were blocked or restricted from its platforms — including TikTok — “for reasons such as advocating for Uyghur independence.”More than half of U.S. states and the federal government have banned TikTok on official devices. The company has called the bans “political theatre"" and says further restrictions are unnecessary due to the efforts it is taking to protect U.S. data by storing it on Oracle servers.The bill was brought to the Montana Legislature after a Chinese spy balloon flew over the state. It would prohibit downloads of TikTok in the state and fine any “entity” — an app store or TikTok — $10,000 per day for each time someone “is offered the ability” to access or download the app. There would not be penalties for users.The American Civil Liberties Union, its Montana chapter and Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital privacy rights advocacy group, have submitted an amicus brief in support of the challenge. Meanwhile, 18 attorneys generals from mostly Republican-led states are backing Montana and asking the judge to let the law be implemented. Even if that happens, cybersecurity experts have said it could be challenging to enforce.Molloy also pressed Corrigan on how the state plans to enforce the law on six of the seven Native American reservations in Montana where the state does not have criminal jurisdiction. Corrigan said the ban would not apply on those reservations.Enforcing Montana's ban would require TikTok to collect location data from its 150 million users in order to block those in Montana, the company argued in court briefs.In asking for the preliminary injunction, TikTok argued that the app has been in use since 2017 and letting Montanans continue to use it will not harm the state. Montana did not identify any evidence of actual harm to any resident as a result of using TikTok and even delayed the ban's effective date until Jan. 1, 2024, the company said.The battle over the Montana law comes as several other states are trying to curb social media use among children.

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,US inflation eased slightly last month as price increases extend slow descent,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Measures of U.S. inflation barely declined in September, evidence that consumer price increases are grinding lower at a gradual pace.Consumer prices rose 0.4% from August to September, below the previous month's 0.6% pace. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that year-over-year inflation was unchanged last month from a 3.7% rise in August.And underlying inflation declined a bit: So-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, climbed 4.1% in September from a year earlier, down from a 4.3% pace in August. That is the smallest such increase in two years. Economists pay particularly close attention to core prices because they provide a good signal of inflation's likely future path.Still, on a month-to-month basis, prices are continuing to rise faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Core prices increased 0.3% from August to September, the same as in the previous month.The report “was a mixed bag,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives, a forecasting firm. ""It still suggests that we have exited the higher inflation regime of the pandemic, but we’re still elevated.”Thursday's inflation data is unlikely to change the Fed's outlook, Rosner-Warburton said, because the central bank already expected only a gradual decline in inflation.“I don’t think this was an upside surprise to the Fed,"" she said. “This is probably in line with what they were expecting.""Rosner-Warburton, like most economists, expects Fed officials to keep their key interest rate unchanged at their next meeting in three weeks, which would leave it at 22-year high of 5.4%.At the same time, the policymakers will likely “keep the door open to more hikes in the future,"" she said, including at their following meeting in December.The main driver of last month's inflation was an uptick in housing costs. Rental prices and a measure that the government computes of the cost of home ownership, which together make up about a third of the total inflation index, accounted for most of overall inflation from August to September. Those costs also accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase in core prices compared with a year ago.Story continuesRental prices rose 0.5% on a monthly basis for a second straight month. Measured year over year, rental costs are up 7.4%, down from a 7.8% rise in August.Rosner-Warburton pointed to an unusual jump in housing prices in Los Angeles as accounting for much of last month's housing inflation, which may not be sustained. Economists have expected rental price increases to steadily moderate. They note that market measures of rents for newly leased apartments have cooled considerably in the past year as the construction of apartment buildings has jumped. It can take time for a decline in new rents to flow through to the government's measure.“We’re somewhat skeptical of the uptick"" in September, Rosner-Warburton said.Hotel prices surged 3.7% just in September after three straight months of declines, and airline fares also rose after a big drop in August.Higher gas prices helped drive inflation for a second straight month. Those prices rose 2.1% just from August to September, after a 10.6% surge the previous month. Gas prices have since come down; they averaged $3.65 a gallon nationally on Thursday, according to AAA, down from $3.84 a month ago.Fuel costs, though, remain much higher than pre-pandemic levels and have forced up shipping costs. That has created a burden for small-business people like Sandy Bialek, who owns Fatbat Brewing, a tap room in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Bialek said shipping costs have jumped for the malts that she buys by the pallet-load.She has had to raise the average price for a beer at her brewery to about $8, from about $6.50, to offset a range of higher costs. Her price increases, she said, have led a few of her regulars to quip, “What are you putting in this beer?”Many of Bialek's working-class local customers have cut back on their visits or drink less when they do come by. More of her business is now coming from visitors to the area.“I think a lot of people are hunkering down and saving and waiting” for inflation to pass, Bialek said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”The more that inflation persists, the more it erodes household paychecks and makes it harder for people to pay for necessities like rent, gas and food. Adjusted for price changes, average hourly wages fell from August to September for a second straight month, the government said. Inflation-adjusted hourly pay has risen by a meager 0.5% from a year ago.“As a consumer, especially if you haven’t seen the kind of wage growth that would help match the inflation growth, you’re probably still pretty frustrated with how high prices have been,” said Yelena Maleyev, an economist at KPMG. “And then, in addition to that now, how high credit costs are.”Consumers did receive some relief last month as prices declined for some goods. Clothing costs dropped 0.8%, though they're up 2.3% compared with a year earlier. Used car prices dropped for a fourth straight month, declining 2.5%. They're now down 8% from a year ago.Grocery prices, after soaring last year, have cooled. They ticked up just 0.1% from August to September and are 2.4% higher than they were a year ago.Economists and Fed officials have long cautioned that inflation would likely ease in a bumpy and uneven way, though it is still expected to keep slowing into 2024. Thursday’s inflation data follows several speeches this week by Fed officials suggesting that they are inclined to leave their benchmark interest rate unchanged at their next meeting Oct. 31- Nov. 1.Longer-term interest rates have spiked since the Fed’s policymakers last raised their key rate in July. Those higher long-term bond rates have led to more expensive mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing, a trend that could help cool inflation pressures without further Fed rate hikes.On Wednesday, Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s governing board who has previously backed sharply higher rates to fight inflation, suggested that price increases are steadily cooling, potentially allowing the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged. Optimism has been growing that the Fed can tame inflation through the series of 11 interest rate hikes it imposed beginning in March 2022 without causing a recession.“We’re in this position where we can kind of watch and see what happens,” Waller said. If core inflation stays as low as it has in recent months, “we’re pretty much back to our target.”Inflation soared in 2021 as the economy roared out of the pandemic recession. Consumers were ramping up their spending on furniture, exercise equipment and appliances even while supply chain bottlenecks contributed to widespread shortages. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine then sent food and gas prices spiking. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2002.Since then, supply chains have unraveled, and food and energy prices have risen much more slowly. In the meantime, the economy has remained largely healthy, and the unemployment rate has barely risen. The steady decline in inflation, without a spike in layoffs or a recession, has confounded economists’ expectations that widespread job losses would be needed to slow price increases.",Yahoo

Projections released at the meeting also showed policymakers expect fewer rate cuts next year than they did in June.Collins, who does not vote in rate decisions this year, said she expects policymakers will need to “hold rates at restrictive levels for some time” and until officials see evidence that inflation is sustainably on a path to 2%.Read More: Fed Minutes Flag High Rates for ‘Some Time’ While Risks ShiftShe also said that high inflation risks were becoming more “balanced” with the risk that officials slow activity more than needed to cool inflation.It may take longer for higher rates to hit some parts of the economy because many households and corporations built up cash piles, in part after locking in low rates early in the pandemic, according to Collins.“These factors have likely made the economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles,” she said.Story continuesCollins, who does not vote in rate decisions this year, said last month that further tightening was possible and that rates may need to stay higher for longer than previously expected for the US central bank to achieve its 2% inflation goal.Several Fed officials have said in recent days that a surge in long-term Treasury yields may lessen the need for further rate hikes.

That may reduce the chances of additional sanctions on Iranian oil and help prevent the nation and its proxies across the Middle East from being drawn into the conflict. Additionally, OPEC+ leader Saudi Arabia on Tuesday reiterated support for the group’s efforts to balance oil markets.Prices are also falling due to a bearish technical move known as a gap fill, which was triggered when prices surged more than $3 on Monday as Hamas’s attack on Israel raised concerns about wider instability in the Middle East.Such spikes often prompt corrective moves to fill the large break in prices before a new trend can be established, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities. Traders will continue to monitor the war and the possibility of more sanctions on Iran, which would be bullish for oil.The war adds another complicated dimension to global oil trading after prices surged in the third quarter as OPEC+ choked off supplies to tighten the market, then gave up some gains as demand concerns flared up. The move by OPEC+ leaves the US playing an increasingly vital role in supplying global markets, with the US government projecting the nation’s oil output will rise to a record this year.The US and Venezuela, meanwhile, are close to reaching an understanding that would bring limited sanctions relief in exchange for steps to ensure fair elections, according to people familiar with the matter.

Craig Torres and Steve Matthews,Fed Minutes Flag High Rates for ‘Some Time’ While Risks Shift,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve policymakers agreed last month that policy should remain restrictive for some time, while noting that the risks of overtightening now had to be balanced against keeping inflation on a downward path toward 2%.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Hamas Leaders Targeted as Ground War LoomsApollo CEO Marc Rowan Demands UPenn Leaders Quit Over ‘Antisemitism’IMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealGoldman Sues Malaysia as 1MDB Settlement Dispute EscalatesHouse Republicans Pick Scalise as Speaker Nominee in Trump Snub“Participants generally judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the committee’s goals had become more two-sided,” according to minutes of the September meeting, released in Washington Wednesday.“All participants” agreed that the committee was in a position to “proceed carefully” and that policy decisions would be data-dependent and take into account “the balance of risks.”To follow Bloomberg’s TopLIVE blog click here“They’re going to be parked on the side, but they’re not unpacking their bags just yet,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “They’re seeing inflation as unacceptably high — and that there are more upside risks,” she added.At the meeting, Fed officials held their benchmark lending rate at a range of 5.25-5.5% last month, and signaled rates would stay higher for longer than previously expected following one more rate increase this year.Since then, a surge in long-term Treasury yields has prompted some policymakers to suggest they may hold off on another hike when they meet on Oct. 31-Nov. 1, as they parse the reasons behind the run-up.After the minutes were published, the Fed-policy sensitive two-year Treasury yield and the dollar pared the day’s gains, while the S&P 500 Index pared losses.Rate DebateThe minutes noted that “a majority” of Fed officials saw one more rate increase “would likely be appropriate” to help cool off demand and get inflation closer to their 2% inflation target over the next two years, while “some” said “no further increases would be warranted.”Story continuesIn forecasts issued last month, 12 of 19 officials projected one more hike this year, while the median estimate showed they expected fewer rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.“Participants generally noted that it was important to balance the risk of overtightening against the risk of insufficient tightening,” the minutes said.Omair Sharif of Inflation Insights said the future of policy remains in a “tug-of-war” between the two risks. “The committee will proceed carefully,” he said Wednesday in a note to clients, adding that most “aren’t yet confident that inflation is on a durable and sustainable path to 2%.”The estimated higher rate peak, coupled with a slower pace of reductions in the next two years, sent bond markets reeling over the past three weeks. Yields on US 10-year notes jumped as much as 40 basis points from the Sept. 20 meeting through Monday, while spreads on corporate credit widened and broader financial conditions tightened.The rapid increase in borrowing costs appears to have surprised some officials on the Federal Open Market Committee, who suggested they may again keep rates unchanged when officials meet in three weeks.Policy PathFed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson on Monday told a conference that he would “remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields” in assessing “the future path of policy.” And Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said the same day that higher yields may lessen the need for further rate increases.Bond markets rallied after those comments and futures markets were pricing in about a 10% chance of a quarter-point rate increase at the next Fed meeting.Other Fed speakers on Wednesday advocated for a cautious approach on future moves.Governor Christopher Waller said the Fed can watch and see what happens before taking further action with interest rates as financial markets tighten. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the central bank doesn’t need to keep raising interest rates unless inflation’s descent starts to stall.The minutes noted that the economy is expanding at a solid pace, labor markets were reaching a better balance, and inflation — while it has cooled — is still running above target. The Dallas Fed, which trims away outlier prices from the personal consumption expenditures price index, calculated the six-month annual inflation rate at 3.1% for August, down from 3.4% in July.Fed officials estimate they need to get economic growth below the 1.8% trend rate to slow price increases.(Adds comments from economists starting in fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Federal Reserve minutes: Officials signal cautious approach to rates amid heightened uncertainty,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials regarded the U.S. economy’s outlook as particularly uncertain last month, according to minutes released Wednesday, and said they would “proceed carefully” in deciding whether to further raise their benchmark interest rate.Such cautious views are generally seen as evidence that the Fed isn't necessarily inclined to raise rates in the near future. Their next meeting is in three weeks.Economic data from the past several months “generally suggested that inflation was slowing,” the minutes of the Sept. 19-20 meeting said. The policymakers added that further evidence of declining inflation was needed to be sure it would slow to the Fed’s 2% target.Several of the 19 policymakers said that with the Fed’s key rate “likely at or near its peak, the focus” of their policy decisions should “shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long” to keep it at economically restrictive levels.And the officials generally acknowledged that the risks to Fed’s policies were becoming more balanced between raising rates too high and hurting the economy and not raising them enough to curb inflation. For most of the past two years, the Fed had said the risks were heavily tilted toward not raising rates enough.Given the uncertainty surrounding the economy, the Fed left its key short-term rate unchanged at 5.4% at its September meeting, the highest level in 22 years, after 11 rates hikes over the previous 18 months.The officials noted several sources of uncertainty. They include the strike by the United Auto Workers union against Detroit automakers; higher oil and gas prices; concern that an economically weaker China would slow growth in the United States; and the threat of an extended U.S. government shutdown. Since the September meeting, two of those threats have abated: Oil and gas prices have dropped. And a government shutdown has been avoided, at least until mid-November.The minutes arrive in a week in which several Fed officials have suggested that a jump in longer-term bond rates could help cool the economy and inflation in the coming months. As a result, the Fed may be able to avoid a rate hike at its next two-day meeting, which ends Nov. 1. Futures markets prices show few investors expect a rate increase at that meeting or at the next one in December.Story continuesOverall inflation, as measured year over year, has dropped from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.7% in August. The latest data on consumer price changes will be released Thursday, and economists expect it to show that annual inflation ticked down in September to 3.6%.On Wednesday, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed’s governing board, suggested that higher long-term bond rates, by making many loans costlier for consumers and businesses, are doing “some of the work for us” in fighting inflation. Waller also underscored the Fed’s cautious approach in his remarks in Park City, Utah, during a question-and-answer session.“We’re in this position where we can kind of watch and see what happens,” Waller said.But he also expressed more optimism about inflation than he has in the past, noting that the past three months of price changes, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, have been “very good.”“If this continues,"" Waller said, “we’re pretty much back to our target.”At their meeting last month, Fed officials issued an optimistic set of projections that envisioned inflation falling over the next two years, with only a small increase in unemployment and modest economic growth. The forecast raised the prospect of a “soft landing” in which inflation would slow to the Fed’s 2% target without causing a deep recession.Yet the projections also showed that the policymakers expected to keep their benchmark rate elevated well into 2024 to keep the economy from sending inflation up again. They showed that Fed officials expected to cut rates only twice next year. Previously, they had penciled in four rate cuts.“We’re fairly close, we think, to where we need to get,” Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the September meeting. “A soft landing is a primary objective. ... That’s what we’ve been trying to achieve.”",Yahoo

Reade Pickert and Rich Miller,Used Car and Airline Prices Signal Inflation Is Here to Stay,"(Bloomberg) -- The rapid descent of US inflation over the last few months is likely too good to last.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israel Vows to Wipe Out Hamas as Ground War LoomsApollo CEO Marc Rowan Demands UPenn Leaders Quit Over ‘Antisemitism’Wall Street Brushes Off Hot PPI as Stocks Advance: Markets WrapIMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealHouse Republicans Pick Scalise as Speaker Nominee in Trump SnubNew upside risks in categories that have played an outsize role in the recent deceleration — like used cars and airfares — are raising the question: Can price pressures in services components like housing slow enough in coming months to sustain the downward trend?While many think the Federal Reserve’s own projections for underlying inflation over the next several months seem too high, there’s more agreement between the central bank and private-sector analysts that a return to the 2% target in 2024 is unlikely.JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman, for example, sees inflation in “core” consumer prices excluding food and energy snapping back to a run rate of about 3.5% annualized over the coming six months as used-car prices, airfares and health-insurance costs stop falling.“Do you think you could get the other components to decelerate core inflation on a run-rate basis by a percentage point to get you back down to where we are now, which is around 2.5%?” Kasman said. “I don’t think so.”Here’s a look at some possible bumps in the road in the months that follow Thursday’s September inflation report that help explain why the Fed and Wall Street economists see elevated inflation continuing through next year:Used CarsA surge in used-car prices during the pandemic helped kick off the inflationary cycle. They rose nearly 60% between June 2020 and January 2022, and have become an important drag on the consumer price index over the last year as prices have retreated somewhat.But ongoing shortages and the risk of production disruptions from the United Auto Workers strike could spark fresh price pressures in the months ahead.Story continues“Even away from the strike, I think a more structural, fundamental problem is that we continue to be really, really short on used cars,” said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights LLC.“Any time you have a pickup in demand for whatever reason, you’re going to see a spike in used cars,” Sharif said, adding that inventories aren’t expected to improve materially until 2025.The range of estimates for used-car prices in the September CPI report due Thursday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underscores how hard the category can be to forecast: Bloomberg Economics expects them to jump 2.2%, while strategists at TD Securities, for instance, see them falling 1.5%.AirfaresIn 11 of the past 15 months, airfares in the CPI — an important component in the broader core services inflation basket — have declined.While airfares may not actively fan inflation in the months ahead, they also probably won’t be as a reliable of a drag. The category itself is quite volatile, in part due to its close relationship with fuel costs.“The concern is that we’ve seen, now, higher energy prices driving headline prices for quite some time, which eventually, then, leads to a reversal in the core, or at least upward pressure on the core,” Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Stifel Financial Corp., told Bloomberg TV.A big wild card is whether the Israel-Hamas war spreads and impacts the flow of oil from the region.For now, the latest surge in oil prices has abated somewhat, and more fundamentally, global airline capacity is finally back to pre-pandemic levels.“You could potentially still see some moves up and down in airfares, but to me, a lot of that has honestly even wrung itself out,” Sharif said. “Capacity is back to normal. Demand is pretty stable.”Medical CareIn almost every month over the past year, medical care services have acted as a substantial drag on the CPI, largely due to the indirect way the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates health-insurance costs based on insurer profit margins. That’s set to begin reversing in the October report due a month from now.But the measure of health-care costs in the personal consumption expenditures price index — published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and favored by the Fed — is quite different. While the CPI aims to measure out-of-pocket costs, the BEA’s index is a broader measure and includes medical services paid for by employers and the government — like Medicaid.The trajectory of the PCE version will probably play an important role in shaping the overall path for the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge in the year ahead due to its weight in the index.Jonathan Millar, senior US economist at Barclays Plc, calls the health care PCE component “one that’s particularly susceptible to uncertainty.” He pointed to lingering cost pressures in the sector, noting outflows of medical professionals in the wake of the pandemic, as an upside risk.HousingHousing costs are paramount because they’re the biggest component of the CPI and among the largest in the PCE index. Rents for those signing new leases surged in the aftermath of the pandemic, but there was a significant lag between reality and when those price increases showed up in the government’s inflation data.The same is true on the downside. By some private-sector measures, rents outright declined at the end of last year, and growth has been relatively subdued in 2023. But it’s not exactly clear when those dynamics will be reflected in the official price indexes.There’s also a bigger question about the balance of supply and demand for housing. On one hand, a glut of multifamily units starting to come online seems to be pressuring rents lower. On the other, mounting affordability challenges in the purchase market — fueled by higher mortgage rates and climbing prices — may keep rental demand elevated.“There’s good reason to think that it will continue to decelerate,” Millar said. But “we are worried that given the fact that housing demand has proven to be so resilient, and this cycle seems like we have a structural shortage of housing, it wouldn’t be hugely surprising” to see rents re-accelerate, he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Business Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsEurope at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo

Chloe Berger,Most millennials and Gen Zers feel they have it a lot harder than their parents did in today’s economy,"Part of growing up is realizing that some stories you were told as a kid aren’t real. Fairies typically lose traction by age seven, unicorns turn to fabled legends, and Santa is eventually revealed to be a fraud (apologies to our readers if any of the above is news). But the truth for some things don’t come to light until you’re older—at least for Gen Z and millennials, who are increasingly feeling like the American Dream that was sold to them is also fictitious.Nearly three-quarters (74%) of millennials and 65% of Gen Zers believe they’re “starting further behind financially” than other generations when they were their age, according to a poll of 2,000 adults conducted for USA Today by the Harris Poll. Mostly everyone else agrees; two-thirds of those surveyed thought young adults are facing hardships that other generations didn’t have to tackle. If the American Dream was ever a reality for some, it’s certainly not one that millennials and Gen Z feels they've experienced.“They're telling us they can't buy into that American Dream the way that their parents and grandparents thought about it—because it's not attainable,” Harris Poll CEO John Gerzema told USA Today, adding that there’s “an entire generation that feels like they're coming of age in sort of this fractured, divisive world.”The American Dream is baked into the nation’s promise to its citizens. Popularized in the 1930s by historian James Truslow Adams, it's synonymous with the bootstraps myth and idea that the U.S. is a land of equal economic opportunity and mobility. But, as researchers point out, not everyone starts out at an even playing field depending on their race, gender, and class. And in an economy marked by high inflation, rising wealth inequality, and a shrinking middle class, the American Dream is getting harder to come by. It’s largely not the economy millennials’ and Gen Z’s parents had to deal with at their age (although boomers did live through the Great Inflation of the 1970s), leaving younger generations to swap the white picket fence for an alternative living style or a rented apartment (which is expensive enough itself).Story continuesThe older cohorts of both generations graduated into ill-timed recessions—the financial crisis and the more short-lived coronavirus recession, respectively—and many of them are also shouldering massive student debt. Housing, one the hallmarks of the American Dream and building wealth, has become an especially elusive Carmen Sandiego figure for them in an overpriced market. After saving up and gaining some financial ground during the early pandemic, some millennials finally entered the housing market only to find themselves priced out by baby boomers who were able to offer all-cash bids. Finding an affordable house can feel like such a maze that 18% of millennials and 12% of Gen Zers think they’ll never own a house, per RedFin.The USA Today and Harris poll isn’t the first finding of its kind. Nearly half of Americans reported that maintaining a standard of living these days is more difficult than it was for their parents in one study from last year. Even those who are faring well recognize the plight in an economy where a $100,000 salary doesn’t go as far as it once did. SoFi’s CEO said that a worker making low six figures “really struggles to live the American Dream.” And JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the dream “frayed,” asserting that the country needs to start paying better wages and addressing the skills gap to ever survive on its last legs.Under such economic constraints, some young adults find themselves living at home or depending on their parents for financial assistance; many are worried that boomers’ actions will negatively influence their financial future, although a highly anticipated wealth transfer might provide some light at the end of the tunnel. But it might be too late for the American Dream.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo
Kevin Crowley and David Wethe,Exxon to Buy Pioneer for $60 Billion to Dominate Shale Oil,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources Co. for $59.5 billion, the supermajor’s largest takeover in more than two decades, as it seeks to become the dominant producer of shale oil.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Netanyahu Talks to Biden, ‘False Alarm’ in NorthIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Israel Forms Emergency Government for War Against HamasStocks Waver on Fed Minutes as Traders Await CPI: Markets WrapIMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealExxon will pay $253 per share in an all-stock deal, according to a statement on Wednesday. The agreement paves the way for Exxon’s biggest acquisition since merging with Mobil Corp. in 1999 and is the world’s largest corporate takeover announced this year.The transaction amounts to an 18% premium for Pioneer investors, based on the closing price on Oct. 5, when reports of the impending deal began to swirl. If finalized, the combination will make Exxon far and away the biggest player in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico and bring the company’s daily production to nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day — 50% more than the next biggest supermajor.Exxon shares dropped 4.1% to $105.96 at 9:37 a.m. in New York. Pioneer rose 0.6%.The agreement will allow Exxon to boost daily output in the Permian region to the equivalent of 2 million barrels in 2027, or more than half of the oil titan’s current worldwide production. Exxon also pledged to reduce net-carbon dioxide emissions from Pioneer assets to zero by 2035, or 15 years sooner than originally planned, according to the release.Exxon’s inventory of yet-to-be-drilled sites in the world’s biggest shale basin will expand, giving it access to a vast number of potential onshore wells that, unlike deepwater ones, can be brought online within months and make Exxon far more nimble at keeping pace with erratic global demand. The acquired assets will turn a profit even if crude prices dip as low as $35 a barrel, Exxon said.Story continuesThe combined company will control the equivalent of 16 billion barrels of crude reserves in the Permian region, according to the statement.Exxon combining with Pioneer would also be the biggest push yet by an oil major into the Permian, consolidating a wide swath of the patch where production has been fragmented and largely the province of independent producers. When shale output in the basin began to boom around the middle of the last decade, big companies like Exxon were nowhere to be found.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysFewer and larger E&Ps dominating the Permian Basin remain our central theme, with acquisitions to build scale in the most economic and prolific of the biggest US liquids basin likely to keep up the pace even if Exxon Mobil doesn’t acquire Pioneer Natural Resources.— Vincent G Piazza and Evan Lee, BI analystsRead the full report here.Supermajors initially shunned the Permian because they were skeptical the wells there could produce sufficient crude over a long enough period of time to yield big profits. It became clear, however, that low-cost, easy-to-drill shale wells enabled companies to quickly ramp up production when needed. It marked a revolutionary departure from Big Oil’s offshore mega projects that cost billions of dollars and require a decade of planning.The Permian went on to become the western hemisphere’s most-prolific oil field, making the US the top global producer.The majors began to take serious notice around 2017, when Exxon bought drilling rights in the Permian from the Bass family of Fort Worth for $6 billion. Chevron Corp., Shell Plc and BP all went on to become big players there, too. Nonetheless, the basin still has more than 1,000 producers, and the majors only make up about 15% of overall production.Exxon has been hunting for another significant acquisition in the Permian for years. The stars, however, never quite aligned. The company’s finances took a hit during the pandemic as oil prices plunged and as it ramped up spending on large global projects, forcing Exxon to borrow billions of dollars to pay dividends.The war in Ukraine changed the landscape. Exxon had already been pulling back on spending, cutting costs and reaping the benefits of pandemic-era investments. Then Russia’s invasion sent oil prices surging. Exxon’s profits jumped to a record $59 billion in 2022. Its stock gained more than 80% last year, providing the financial firepower for a era-defining deal with Pioneer.The deal is apt to face tough antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission. President Joe Biden has asked the commission to investigate high gasoline prices and last year singled out Exxon’s record profits, accusing the company of making “more money than God.”Questions have swirled about a potential Exxon-Pioneer deal since April, when the smaller company’s Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield announced that he planned to retire at year’s end. Sheffield has worked in the Permian since the 1970s and is credited as an architect of the shale boom that made the US an oil powerhouse.Read More: How Shale’s Oil and Gas Reshaped the World of Energy: QuickTakeSheffield’s more than 20 collective years at the helm of Pioneer is one of the longest ongoing public CEO tenures in the US oil industry. He cut his teeth in the Permian basin more than 40 years ago, continuing to work there through the dark decades when supermajors including Exxon abandoned the basin to search for crude overseas. By the time drilling and fracking innovations developed in natural gas fields were adapted to oil deposits around 2010, Pioneer was well-placed to become one of the fastest-growing producers.Citigroup acted as lead financial advisor, Centerview Partners as financial advisor, and Davis Polk & Wardwell as legal advisor to Exxon.

Monthly inflation stood at 0.26%.The central bank has been applying half-percentage point cuts to the benchmark Selic, lowering it to 12.75% last month, after reversing the jump in consumer prices that accompanied the re-opening of the Brazilian economy. Inflation is now picking up again due to base effects and higher energy costs, though analysts expect cost-of-living increases to cool in coming weeks.What Bloomberg Economics Says“September’s CPI report was mostly benign and should see Brazil’s central bank proceed as planned with a 50-basis-point rate cut to 12.25% at its Nov. 1 meeting.

Meanwhile, food and beverage fell 0.71%.Story continuesAnnual inflation has now bounced back above the upper bound of the central bank’s target range. Policymakers target cost-of-living increases at 3.25% for this year, with a tolerance band of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.Analysts were bracing for price gains across sectors following hikes to fuel costs from state-controlled oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA in August. Services inflation, an indicator that policymakers watch closely, firmed on the month as the labor market in Latin America’s largest economy stays strong.“The continued strength of services inflation supports our view that inflation and interest rates won’t come down as quickly as is widely anticipated,” William Jackson, Chief Emerging Markets Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note published after the consumer price report.Read More: Hot Job Markets Spur Brazil, Mexico Economies Against All OddsFurther complicating hopes of steeper rate cuts, the recent surge in US Treasury yields is intensifying the weakening of the real, which has the potential to pressure consumer prices further.President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva plans to aggressively boost government spending next year — and doubts about how he will fund the 2024 budget are pushing long-term inflation expectations well above the central bank’s 3% consumer-price target for next year and 2025.--With assistance from Giovanna Serafim and Robert Jameson.(Adds inflation report details and analyst comments starting in fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaEurope at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
"Kevin Crowley, David Wethe and Mitchell Ferman",Exxon’s Historic Shale Deal Signals New Wave of Oil Mergers,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp.’s $59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., the biggest US energy deal in decades, is poised to usher in a new era of industry-shifting takeovers.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Netanyahu Talks to Biden, ‘False Alarm’ in NorthIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Israel Forms Emergency Government for War Against HamasStocks Waver on Fed Minutes as Traders Await CPI: Markets WrapIMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealThe shale sector is a hotbed of consolidation talk as cash-rich oil companies compete for the best drilling portfolios in the Permian Basin, North America’s biggest source of crude. Output from that region of West Texas and New Mexico has doubled in just six years to the point where it yields more oil on a daily basis than OPEC heavyweight Iraq.That robust expansion has exhausted some of the Permian’s highest-quality drilling targets, and companies flush with cash from record profits are turning to acquisitions to shore up future productive capacity. Investors have a lot on the line because a deep bench of untapped reserves are the best guarantee that generous dividends can be maintained in the long term.“People are definitely going to run out of inventory over the next several years,” Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said during a conference call just two months before details of the Exxon deal surfaced. That dynamic “should lead to extreme consolidation.”North American energy companies completed $75 billion of deals through the first three quarters of the year, roughly flat with a year earlier. But when you combine Exxon’s swoop for Pioneer with all other proposed deals in various stages of advancement, this would be the industry’s biggest deal-making year since the pre-pandemic era, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Next up after Pioneer, all eyes are on CrownRock, one of the Permian’s biggest closely held oil and gas producers. The company run by Republican Party fundraiser Tim Dunn is up for sale and could fetch around $8 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. CrownRock didn’t respond to a request to comment.Story continuesHere is a list of other shale companies potentially playing some role in the consolidation of the sector:ChevronExxon’s biggest domestic rival, Chevron Corp., already controls Permian drilling rights across an area equal in size to Yellowstone National Park and has plans to push daily output in the region to the equivalent of 1 million barrels of oil by 2025.CEO Mike Wirth has been a savvy dealmaker, snapping up Noble Energy during the pandemic and Denver-based PDC Energy earlier this year after walking away from Anadarko Petroleum in 2019 to avoid a bidding war with Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chevron’s stock trades at 7.7 times cash flow, higher than all its oil-producing competitors in the S&P 500 Energy Index, giving it strong currency with which to transact.ConocoPhillipsConocoPhillips began aggressively expanding in the Permian Basin during the Covid-19 pandemic with its $13 billion takeover of Concho Resources, one of the region’s biggest independent explorers. CEO Ryan Lance followed that within months with the $9.5 billion purchase of Shell Plc’s Permian assets. ConocoPhillips’ stock has climbed 60% in the two years since then and its market value is now higher than supermajor BP Plc.Civitas ResourcesCivitas Resources Inc. has been an active dealmaker this year, expanding into the Permian with an acquisition from private equity firm NGP Energy Capital Management for about $4.7 billion in cash and stock. In October, the Denver-based producer reinforced its Permian position when it agreed to buy oil assets in West Texas from Vitol Group for about $2.15 billion.Read More: Civitas Follows US Shale Playbook of Buying Assets, Cutting RigsCoterra EnergyFormed through the 2021 merger of Cabot Oil & Gas and Cimarex Energy, Coterra Energy Inc. has been carefully searching for deals.“We’re going to be very cautious on M&A,” CEO Thomas Jorden said during a May conference call, adding that the company “would love to find a transaction” that adds value. “But quite frankly, a lot of the assets out there have peaked production.”Devon EnergyThe Oklahoma City company is seen as a possible takeover target because of its diversified footprint across five of the biggest US shale fields, with most of its output coming from the Permian. Devon Energy Corp. bulked up last year with a pair of deals that totaled about $2.7 billion.Diamondback EnergyDiamondback Energy Inc. purchased Permian explorer Firebird Energy LLC for about $1.6 billion in late 2022. Weeks later, it made a similarly sized deal to buy drilling rights from closely held Lario Oil and Gas Co. On a combined basis, the Firebird and Lario transactions expanded Diamondback’s Permian footprint by an area almost twice the size of Brooklyn.EOG ResourcesOne of the largest independent US shale operators, EOG Resources Inc. has shown little interest in big dealmaking. When CEO Ezra Yacob and other EOG executives are quizzed by analysts about the prospect for M&A, they typically say they’re focused on expanding organically and through small, bolt-on acquisitions.“We built this company on the success of organic exploration and we see that as the best opportunity for full-cycle returns,” Yacob said at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference on Sept. 5. “We’re not collecting cash on the balance sheet to do some sort of M&A.”Marathon OilWith assets across shale fields in New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas, Marathon Oil Corp. last beefed up its Lone Star State footprint in 2022. The Houston-based producer bought Ensign Natural Resources’ Eagle Ford Shale assets in South Texas for $3 billion in cash.Permian ResourcesThe eponymous shale driller’s $2 billion, all-stock agreement to acquire Earthstone Energy Inc. in August was the latest deal for Will Hickey and James Walter, the 30-something co-chief executives who have built Permian Resources Corp. into a major independent shale operator through a series of mergers.Permian hired Guy Oliphint, managing director and co-head of upstream Americas at investment bank Jefferies as executive vice president and CFO in January.--With assistance from Kiel Porter.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaEurope at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo
PAUL WISEMAN,"Wholesale inflation in US rises 2.2% in September, biggest year-over-year gain since April","WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. wholesale prices rose last month at the fastest pace since April, suggesting that inflationary pressures remain despite a year and a half of higher interest rates.The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its producer price index — which measures inflation before it hits consumers — climbed 2.2% from a year earlier. That was up from a 2% uptick in August.On a month-to-month basis, producer prices rose 0.5% from August to September, down from 0.7% from July to August.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose 2.7% in September from a year earlier and 0.3% from August. The Federal Reserve and many outside economists pay particular attention to core prices as a good signal of where inflation might be headed.Wholesale prices have been rising more slowly than consumer prices, raising hopes that inflation may continue to ease as producer costs make their way to the consumer. But Wednesday's numbers, driven by an uptick in the price of goods, came in higher last month than economists had expected. Wholesale energy prices surged 3.3% from August to September, and food prices rose 0.9% after tumbling 0.5% from July to August.Last year, inflation reached highs not seen in four decades, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates aggressively. The central bank has boosted its benchmark rate 11 times since March 2022. Those higher borrowing costs have helped cool inflation and slow a still-solid job market.There are growing expectations that the Fed may decide to leave interest rates alone for the rest of the year. On Monday, two Fed officials suggested that the central bank may leave its key rate unchanged at its next meeting in three weeks, helping touch off a rally in bonds and stocks.Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said last month’s higher producer prices “likely do not change the outlook for Fed policy. Our baseline remains that rates are at a peak. For the Fed, geopolitical developments will be an additional risk factor which will likely keep policymakers proceeding cautiously going forward.″In the meantime, the economy has remained sturdier than expected. Optimism is rising that the Fed may pull off a ''soft landing'' — raising rates just enough to tame inflation without tipping the economy into a deep recession.On Thursday, the Labor Department will issue its closely watched consumer price index for September. Last month, the department reported that compared with 12 months earlier, core consumer prices in August rose at the smallest pace in nearly two years.",Yahoo

"Liana Baker, Kiel Porter and Kevin Crowley",Exxon Nears $58 Billion Deal to Buy Pioneer in Big Oil Bet,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. is close to a $58 billion deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources Co., underpinning a bet that oil and gas will remain central to the world’s energy mix for decades no matter what path nations take toward a lower-carbon future.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowChina Mulls New Stimulus, Higher Deficit to Meet Growth GoalExxon is in talks to pay more than $250 a share for the Irving, Texas-based shale producer, according to a person familiar with the matter. An all-stock deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday, said people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because it isn’t public.A final agreement hasn’t been reached and the terms could change or talks could still end without a deal, the people said. Representatives for Exxon and Pioneer declined to comment.An agreement at $250 a share would be a 16% premium to Pioneer’s closing price of $214.96 on Thursday, before reports emerged that the two companies were in talks. That would value Pioneer at at least $58 billion, based on its outstanding share count, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The deal would be the largest corporate takeover announced globally this year and Exxon’s biggest acquisition since merging with Mobil Corp. in 1999. Big strategic bets with the potential to shape the future of the world’s energy system have strong precedent at Exxon, which has survived wars, nationalization and public outcry throughout its 140-year history.Read More: Exxon CEO’s Quest for Mega Deal Is a Bet on Oil’s Staying PowerA combination would unite two of the biggest acreage holders in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, making Exxon far and away the formation’s dominant oil producer. The region is the most prolific oil patch in the US, with a broad inventory of yet-to-be-drilled sites that could be quickly brought online to make Exxon more nimble at keeping pace with global demand.Story continuesWhile the US shale boom has been driven by independent producers like Pioneer, many of those firms didn’t survive the multiple downturns of the past decade. Now that the energy transition is making medium-term oil demand so uncertain, shale’s flexibility is an attractive proposition for companies like Exxon.A Pioneer sale may spark similar interest in shale producers from companies with strong balance sheets, like Chevron Corp. or Occidental Petroleum Corp., according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence.Read More: Exxon’s Move on Pioneer Is Momentous for ShalePioneer rose 0.8% to close at $237.41 in New York trading Tuesday, giving the company a market value of about $55 billion. The shares climbed as much as 3% more after the close of regular trading. Exxon fell 0.4% to $110.45, for a market value of about $442 billion.Exxon has been hunting for big acquisitions in the Permian Basin for years, but the timing was never quite right. The company’s finances took a hit during the coronavirus pandemic as oil prices plunged and as it ramped up capital spending on large global projects, forcing Exxon to borrow billions of dollars to pay dividends.Then the company pulled back on spending, cut costs and got a huge boost as oil prices surged following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its profit jumped to a record $59 billion in 2022, and the stock gained more than 80% last year, providing the financial firepower for a potentially era-defining deal with Pioneer.Attention has been focused on the future of Pioneer since founder and Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said in April that he planned to retire at year’s end.

Laura Curtis,Fed’s Daly Says Neutral Interest Rate Could Be Higher Than Pre-Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said the neutral interest rate could be higher now than before the pandemic, though rates would not stay as high as they are now indefinitely.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowChina Mulls New Stimulus, Higher Deficit to Meet Growth Goal“5% is not going to be the new neutral. There’s no evidence that that will be the new neutral — that’s still the policy rate trying to fight back high inflation,” Daly said Tuesday at a town hall event in Chicago, coordinated by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.“I completely could imagine that we go from 2.5 — anywhere between 2.5 and 3 as the nominal neutral,” she said. “But that’s 50 basis points, not 250 basis points.”The US economy has shown surprising resilience in the face of the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign, which took the target range for its benchmark interest rate to 5.25% to 5.5% from nearly zero in less than two years.That resilience has prompted speculation that the so-called neutral rate for the economy, which Fed officials have estimated at 2.5% since before the pandemic, may have risen.For now, the central bank is trying to decide whether it needs to hike again in 2023 after leaving its benchmark unchanged at the last policy meeting in September.Daly, who doesn’t vote on rate decisions this year, is among Fed officials signaling that tighter financial conditions driven by a recent surge in US Treasury yields may reduce the need for more rate hikes. Yields on 10-year Treasury securities have risen about 25 basis points since the September meeting.“Recently, bond yields have tightened, meaning financial conditions have tightened,” Daly said Tuesday. “If that’s tight, maybe the Fed doesn’t need to do as much. That’s why I said, depending on whether it unravels, or whether the momentum in the economy changes, that could be equivalent to another rate hike.”Story continuesFutures markets are showing a less-than-20% chance of another quarter-point increase when Fed officials next meet on Oct. 31-Nov. 1.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Jonnelle Marte,Fed’s Kashkari Says Yields’ Impact on Rate Outlook Is Unclear,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said he wasn’t yet convinced that a surge in long-term Treasury yields would lessen the need for further rate hikes, saying it depends on what is driving the recent rise in borrowing costs.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowChina Mulls New Stimulus, Higher Deficit to Meet Growth Goal“It’s certainly possible that higher long-term yields may do some of the work for us in terms of bringing inflation back down,” Kashkari said Tuesday during a town hall event hosted by Minot State University.“But if those higher long-term yields are higher because their expectations about what we’re going to do has changed, then we might actually need to follow through on their expectations in order to maintain those yields,” he added.Three Fed officials have said in recent days that a rise in Treasury yields may lessen the need for further rate increases. Investors see a less than 20% chance of another quarter-point increase when policymakers meet again on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, according to pricing in futures markets.“It’s hard for me to say definitively that because they moved, we don’t have to move,” Kashkari said. “I don’t know yet.”The Minneapolis Fed chief, who votes on monetary policy decisions this year, said he wanted to see further inflation, labor-market and wage data “for me to get comfortable that we’ve actually done enough.”Kashkari called the recent run-up in yields “perplexing,” and said it may be driven by growing optimism about the economy over the next five to 10 years or higher US government borrowing.Another reason could be that markets expect the Fed to be more aggressive in its efforts to keep inflation in check over the next decade, but he said, “it’s hard to see that that would translate to me to 10-year yields being up as much as they are, so it’s a little bit of a head-scratcher.”Story continuesKashkari also echoed remarks he made last month, when he placed 60% odds on the likelihood the Fed would raise rates once more this year and return inflation to its 2% target without causing severe damage to the economy.(Updates with additional Kashkari remarks in seventh paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Julia Fanzeres and Alex Longley,Oil Steadies Near $86 After Initial Jolt From Israel-Hamas War,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil steadied after the biggest jump in six months as markets digested the fallout from Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel over the weekend as well as the prospect of new economic stimulus measures in China.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowChina Mulls New Stimulus, Higher Deficit to Meet Growth GoalNearly 2,000 people have died so far as the conflict in Israel, which has the potential for wider geopolitical ramifications, entered a fourth day. West Texas Intermediate settled below $86 a barrel after jumping more than $3 on Monday.While crude futures are moderating, rising tensions in the Middle East are keeping oil markets on alert, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities.“If we continue to see escalation between Israel and Hamas, it’s just a matter of time until it reaches into oil-producing areas,” Kissler said. “All eyes will be watching Israel’s progress and any intentions they may have into Iran.”While Israel and the Gaza Strip play a minor role in the world of oil, the Middle East accounts for about a third of global supply, and the market is still worried about potential threats. Stricter enforcement of US sanctions on Iranian crude exports and any blockades or attacks on vessels in key shipping lanes are the main risks, while the conflict also transforms the landscape for any potential US, Saudi and Israeli security pact.President Joe Biden said some 14 American citizens had died, with others likely held hostage by Hamas. Iran denied on Monday that it was involved in the assault.Meanwhile, China is considering new measures to help its economy meet the country’s official growth target. An announcement could come this month, people familiar with the matter said.Story continuesThe conflict has ratcheted up the volatility of oil prices, which have swung over the past month as concerns over high interest rates and slowing growth halted a rally that had been underpinned by Saudi Arabian-led output cuts.

Craig Torres,"Fed Is Determined to Bring Inflation Back to 2% Target, Waller Says","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the US central bank is determined to bring inflation back to its 2% target in a speech that mostly avoided the current state of markets or monetary policy.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowStocks Rise as Wall Street Dials Back Fed Wagers: Markets Wrap“We have reaffirmed this numerical goal repeatedly since 2012, and, in tightening monetary policy since early last year, we’ve made clear that we’re determined to bring inflation down to 2%,” Waller said in remarks at an event sponsored by George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. “This is why we have taken forceful steps aimed at reducing inflation — and why we will stay on the job to achieve our objective.”The majority of Waller’s remarks were about the legacy of the economist Bennett McCallum, whom the conference was named after. He didn’t comment on the near-term outlook for interest rates.The US economy has shown surprising resilience in the face of the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign, which took the policy rate to 5.25% to 5.5% from zero in less than two years. The labor market remains strong, while inflation is starting to cool as supply channels normalize, more workers flow back into the labor pool, with possibly some increase in productivity.Waller strongly reaffirmed the 2% inflation target while noting that the other side of the Fed’s mandate — maximum employment — is a level that may vary over time.A rout in credit markets may suspend the need to tighten further for now, three Fed officials have said in recent days.Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson on Monday told a conference that he would “remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields” in assessing “the future path of policy.” echoing similar comments from other policymakers in recent days.Story continuesFutures markets are showing a less than 20% chance of another quarter-point increase when the Federal Open Market Committee meets Oct. 31-Nov. 1.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Josh Schafer,Bonds aren't 'out of the woods yet' — and that could mean trouble for stocks,"Treasury yields fell on Tuesday, easing off 16-year highs that had spooked markets over the past week.But Sofi head of investment strategy Liz Young told Yahoo Finance Live that the market's latest ""pain trade"" might not be over.""I don't think bonds are completely out of the woods yet,"" Young said. ""We also haven't seen very much weak economic data ... At this point there hasn't been a good reason for yields to come down and stay down.""Young highlights that yields are moving down ahead of the latest read on inflation expected on Thursday. Last month's Consumer Price Index report showed prices grew 3.7% in August compared to last year, an increase driven largely by rising energy prices. While economists surveyed by Bloomberg see inflation ticking down to 3.6% in September, Young is ""not super optimistic"" based on energy prices moving higher for much of the month.Higher inflation could prompt the Fed to hike interest rates once more. Recent research from BlackRock shows the 10-year Treasury yield has closely tracked the Fed funds rate during this and other hiking cycles.

Allan Sloan,Meet the real recession referees,"Scarcely a news cycle goes by these days without Wall Street types, various economists, and the occasional journalist opining about whether the US is headed for a recession or in a recession or isn’t likely to be in a recession anytime soon.Or whether we’re headed for a soft landing. Or a hard landing or some other sort of landing as the result of the terrible conflict in the Middle East.Are you confused by all this blather? If so, welcome to the club.And welcome to the world of the Business Cycle Dating Committee.The committee, created in 1978 by the National Bureau of Economic Research, is a nongovernmental, nonpartisan organization of academic economists that rules definitively on when recessions begin or end. It operates on the basis of economics, not politics.To avoid having to reverse itself, the committee doesn’t announce for months (or sometimes more than a year) after the fact that a recession has begun or ended. For example, it took until July 19, 2021 for the committee to announce that the economy had bottomed in April of 2020. That’s the committee’s most recent announcement. Playing the waiting game: president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, James Poterba. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS)Jim Poterba told me that defining a recession as two straight quarters of declining real GDP can lead people astray.Let’s say, Poterba said, that we have two straight quarters of a tiny decline in real GDP — say 0.1% a quarter — but other indicators, such as employment and spending, remain strong. To say that two consecutive quarterly declines mean we’re in a recession would make no sense, he said.Or let’s say there’s a 2.5% quarterly decline in real GDP caused by a factor such as bad weather in the Midwest that hurts economic output, followed by a 0.1% quarterly increase followed by a 3.5% quarterly decline, with employment and spending both falling sharply. That wouldn’t be considered a recession by the two consecutive quarters of declining real GDP definition — but would clearly be a recession.One of the things that I also like about the committee is that when it makes a call of the economy entering or exiting a recession, it tells everyone about it at the same time via email.This way someone like me — I just signed up for the list — would see the committee’s ruling the same time Wall Street’s trading desks will. (You can sign up for committee reports by using this link.)Sure, signing up for announcements that come months after a recession has begun or ended doesn’t offer you any advantages in buying or selling securities. And it’s not as much fun as watching and reading people bickering about economic numbers.But it’s a much better use of your time and mental energy.Allan Sloan, who has written about business for more than 50 years, is a seven-time winner of the Gerald Loeb Award, business journalism’s highest honor.

Jonnelle Marte,Fed’s Bostic Says Rates Now High Enough to Lower Inflation to 2%,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic reiterated that he doesn’t think policymakers need to raise interest rates any further and that policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation back to their 2% goal.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: US Wants Qatar to Be an Intermediary With HamasIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingStocks Rise as Wall Street Dials Back Fed Wagers: Markets Wrap“I think that our policy rate is at a sufficiently restrictive position to get inflation down to 2%,” Bostic said Tuesday during a conversation held at the annual convention for the American Bankers Association. “I actually don’t think we need to increase rates anymore.”Bostic added that an unexpected change to the economic outlook could require officials to lift rates higher, but that’s not what he currently expects.Top Fed officials are uniting around the idea that tighter financial conditions driven by a recent surge in US Treasury yields may reduce the need for additional increases in their benchmark interest rate. Yields on 10-year Treasury securities have risen about 40 basis points since the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 policy meeting — to about 4.7% Tuesday morning.When asked how rising Treasury yields could affect policy, Bostic said Tuesday that rates are “clearly” restrictive, the economy is slowing down and more impacts from the Fed’s increases have yet to come.Read More: Fed Officials Head Toward Another Pause After Bond Yields SurgePolicymakers need to evaluate whether the recent increase in borrowing costs reflects investor expectations for a stronger economy or just extra compensation required to bear interest-rate risk. Parsing it will probably keep them on hold at least through their next rate decision on Nov. 1. Officials have raised their benchmark rate by more than 5 percentage points over the past year and a half, reaching a 22-year high.Story continuesThe Atlanta Fed chief, who does not vote on rate decisions this year, has been among the central bank’s most dovish officials in recent months, arguing that the Fed should stop raising rates and instead focus on how long to keep them high. Bostic said last week the Fed should hold rates at elevated levels “for a long time” to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.Asked about the recent violent attacks in Israel, Bostic said the turmoil could add new uncertainty to the outlook for the global economy, and emphasized that the Fed must be nimble and ready to adapt to changing circumstances.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Josh Schafer,The 60/40 investing strategy is broken. But it's 'far from dead.',"If the traditional 60/40 portfolio is meant to be a portfolio diversifier, it's not working. Recent analysis from Bloomberg shows the correlation between the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) hasn't been this high since 2005.So as bonds sold off last week, stocks followed, leaving nowhere to hide for 60/40 investors, who allocate 60% of their investment to stocks and 40% to bonds to hedge against market downturns.Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance it's another sign ""the traditional playbook is challenged.""Lerner and other strategists that Yahoo Finance spoke with pointed to the Federal Reserve's historically fast rate hiking cycle when explaining why the 60/40 portfolio hasn't been working like it used to.If things had played out as many expected over the past year, the US would be in a recession by now. Stocks would be down and more investors would likely be in bonds. Instead, a stronger-than-expected economy is reacting better than expected to tight monetary policy.""The economy has been less interest rate sensitive than most people would've thought,"" Lerner said. ""By this time ... If you were raising rates this aggressively you would've thought the economy would've slowed down more meaningfully, which also would've reduced inflation pressures even more and brought down yields on the bond side.""Callie Cox of eToro recently told Yahoo Finance that if there were a clear consensus that a recession is coming, bonds would be catching more bids. But as data continues to come in stronger than expected, what happens next for the economy has become convoluted.A resilient labor market could continue to support consumer spending while inflation tracks lower, setting the stage for an end to Fed rate hikes and a ""soft landing"" scenario. Or the resilient US economy could stay so strong it reaccelerates inflation and forces the Fed into further rate hikes, likely sending the economy into a recession.Story continuesIf there were a consensus favorite on those two outcomes, the recent market volatility and increased correlation between bonds and stocks likely wouldn't be present. But that hasn't played out. Even with yields growing increasingly attractive and fears of a ""higher for longer"" stance from the Fed haunting markets, few investors have fled to safety in bonds.Strategists don't think that will last forever, though, as the prospects of a 60/40 portfolio, and diversification from stocks, become increasingly attractive.

Jonnelle Marte,"New York Fed’s Perli Says Balance-Sheet Runoff Smooth, Eyes Risk","(Bloomberg) -- A senior official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the central bank’s balance-sheet runoff has been running smoothly with “no significant” disruptions to markets, but the Fed will continue to monitor for risks.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Biden Vows Full Support for Israel, Sends BlinkenSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingBrutality of Surprise Attack Unites Israel Around One Goal: Crush Hamas“Recently, our implementation framework has confronted a number of stress tests and performed quite well,” said Roberto Perli, the manager of the System Open Market Account who oversees the Fed’s portfolio. “This is all encouraging, but we remain cognizant of the risks and uncertainties ahead.”Perli spoke Tuesday in remarks prepared for the National Association for Business Economics meeting in Dallas.After raising the benchmark federal funds rate by more than five percentage points over the past year and a half, a majority of US central bankers at their September policy meeting projected it would be appropriate to enact one more quarter-point increase by the end of 2023. But some officials have said the recent rise in Treasury yields could further restrain the economy and lessen the need for additional increases.Runoff PlanThe US central bank is shrinking its massive balance sheet — after it roughly doubled in size during the pandemic — through a process known as quantitative tightening, or QT. The Fed has offloaded more $1 trillion in bond holdings since it began reducing its portfolio last year, with few signs of the financial market strains that spooked policymakers the last time they oversaw such a program.As the Fed removes liquidity from the banking system, money-market funds and other eligible financial firms are parking less cash at the Fed’s facility for reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repo.Story continuesThere is nearly $1.3 trillion parked with the program, down from the all-time high of $2.55 trillion seen at the end of 2022. If the balance-sheet reduction begins to eat more into reserves parked with the Fed, it could lead to scarcity and push the central bank to rethink the pace of QT.Perli said usage of the reverse-repo program could decline more, “possibly to low levels.” But he said officials will watch markets closely for signs of stress and that the Fed intends to slow and then stop its balance-sheet reduction while reserves are still above the levels considered “ample.”That moment has not arrived, and officials will be watching money-market conditions for signs of stress, Perli said. “The commitee will make that judgment based on careful analysis and market monitoring that incorporates price signals from money markets as well as extensive market outreach and intelligence,” he said.Perli’s speech mark his first public remarks since he started the role in February, taking over a position previously held by Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

A net 43% of small-business owners saw business conditions deteriorating in the next six months, the most since May.Small firms were also increasingly pessimistic about credit availability. The share of survey respondents saying it was harder to get a loan compared to three months ago increased to 8% on net — the most since March, when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates to the highest level since the early 2000s to tame persistent inflation. Officials have reiterated the need to keep borrowing costs higher for longer, triggering a recent selloff in the bond market.Here’s what else small businesses had to say about credit conditions:One in 10 firms on net expect worse credit conditions in the next three months, matching the highest share since 2012.About a quarter of borrowers on net said they now pay a higher interest rate compared to three months ago, matching the highest share since 2006.Small-business owners said they paid an average interest rate of 9.8% on short-term loans, the highest in data back to 2013.Respondents to the NFIB survey continued to rank inflation and labor quality among their single-most important problems. The share of small businesses who raised selling prices rose for a second month in September, marking the first back-to-back increase since early 2022.Story continues“Owners remain pessimistic about future business conditions, which has contributed to the low optimism they have regarding the economy,” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “The bottom line is being squeezed, leaving owners few options beyond raising selling prices for financial relief.”Hiring struggles were evident as well. Firms reporting job openings that were hard to fill rose by the most since the start of the year, to 43%.

Grant Smith,OPEC’s Spare Oil Buffer Can Help Market Weather Mideast Storm,"(Bloomberg) -- Global oil markets may be facing heightened risk from tumult in the Middle East, but they’re better equipped to weather the shock than during previous crises.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Biden Assures Netanyahu of US Support in CallSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingBrutality of Surprise Attack Unites Israel Around One Goal: Crush HamasHaving slashed crude output this year to prop up prices, Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ allies are left with a healthy reserve of spare production capacity. Outside of the Covid pandemic — when lockdowns caused demand to slump — it’s the biggest buffer in more than a decade.OPEC, primarily Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, will be sitting on more than 4 million barrels a day of idle capacity this year and next, about 4% of global supplies, according to the US Energy Information administration.That’s almost double the cushion they held during other regional crisis, such as when the kingdom’s Abqaiq processing facility was bombarded by Iran in 2019, or when Islamic State fighters captured huge swathes of Iraq in 2014. It’s almost 20% more than when Libyan output collapsed during the uprising against Moammar Al Qaddafi in 2011.After initially surging more than 5% in the wake of Hamas’s weekend attack on Israel, crude prices have since subsided back below $88 a barrel in London. That’s largely due to the lack of immediate threat to oil supplies, but it may also reflect the reassuring impact of OPEC’s spare oil.Whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners could ultimately dip into that trove isn’t clear. Riyadh has chosen to squeeze supplies so far this year, pushing prices to almost $100 a barrel last month. The deciding factor may be whether Iran, the main backer of Hamas, faces tighter US sanctions on its oil exports as a result of the current crisis.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Eleanor Pringle,Janet Yellen says inflation is actually being ‘really well-behaved’ as she denies strong jobs report that scared markets is anything other than a good thing,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is confident that American consumers, businesses, and banks will be able to survive rising interest rates—and believes the Fed’s battle to slay the inflation dragon appears to be going rather well.Yellen, who arrived in Marrakech this week for the IMF and World Bank annual meeting, also dismissed fears that a strong jobs report could actually prove to be a negative for the economy.Yellen noted that core inflation—which excludes fast-moving prices in food and energy—is actually “really well-behaved,” while speaking to the Financial Times.Over the past 12 months inflation has been slashed, as the Fed raised rates to their highest levels in 22 years this summer to now sit at 5.5%.It seems to be working. In August 2023, inflation sat at 3.7%, down from 8.3% the year prior. The August figure was also driven in part by an increase in oil which peaked at $3.984 per gallon in the third week of the month.Yellen also refused to concede that a strong jobs report for September was anything other than a good thing for the U.S. economy.The jobs report, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed the economy added approximately 336,000 roles in the month, considerably higher than August’s net gain of 227,000 jobs.Seemingly great news, right? Wrong. The market reacted skittishly, fearing a strong labor report could push the Fed into keeping rates higher for longer.Yellen dismissed such concerns, saying the report was “impressive” and should be seen as “positive, not a negative."" She added that after all, the report implies “more people wanting to work and finding jobs.”“What could be a problem is if we saw the labor market overheating, but I didn’t really see evidence here of that,” she added.What about the bond rout?Wall Street is less convinced by Yellen’s take on the jobs report, indicating its discomfort by a further selloff in the bond market.The U.S. Treasury market—the foundation of much of the global financial system—is currently seeing a 16-year-high in its 10-year bond yields. The selloff isn't just a headache for U.S. officials, as an increase in the cost of borrowing in the U.S. also lifts costs around the world.Story continuesBut Yellen remained unfazed by the notion that interest rates are causing any “dysfunction” in the American market.“I haven’t seen any evidence of dysfunction in connection with the increase in interest rates. When rates are more volatile, sometimes you see some impact on market function, but that is pretty standard,” she said.Her confidence was echoed, to some extent, by Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel who wrote the economy’s strength shouldn’t lead the Fed to push for any further rate hikes.“Is the economy too strong?” professor Siegel pondered in his Wisdom Tree weekly blog. “Yields jumped in reaction to the employment report because there’s worry the Fed will stay higher for longer. The initial equity market reaction to the employment report was a drop, but it closed on Friday much stronger—which I think is the right reaction.“He added that “none” of the data—no matter how strong—led him to think the Fed would increase rates again, given the fact there are still so many uncertainties in the economy.These include the UAW strike, some weakness in the housing market, and the continued threat of a government shutdown.“I don’t think a one-tenth higher than expected inflation will force the Fed to hike,” professor Siegel noted. “Maybe 0.2% to 0.3% hotter than expected inflation might cause to the Fed to hike.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo
WAYNE PARRY,"Casino industry spurs $329 billion in US economic activity, study by gambling group shows","ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — The casino gambling industry in the U.S. generates nearly $329 billion a year in economic activity, according to a new study by the industry's national trade association.The American Gaming Association released a study Monday showing the industry's economic impact in 2022 was up 26% from 2017, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.Commercial and tribal casinos support 1.8 million jobs, including 700,000 jobs at casinos themselves or related businesses, about the same as in 2017. Those jobs generated $104 billion in wages across the country, up 40% from 2017, according to the study.The industry paid $52.7 billion last year in taxes to federal, state and local governments, up 29% since 2017, the report said.The report was the first such study released by the association since 2018, which presented 2017 data.Bill Miller, president and CEO of the association, said the numbers show the casino industry's “resiliency and continued strength” since the pandemic first hit.“Think back to where we were a few years ago with nearly 1,000 casinos, almost all of them closed,” he said. “Today, we're seeing record revenue in the industry.”Miller said the association will use numbers from the survey to press its case to lawmakers in favor of gambling industry goals, including a government crackdown on unlicensed gambling operations.The U.S. casino industry is having its best year ever this year in terms of the amount of money won from gamblers. It is on a pace to exceed the $60 billion it won from gamblers last year.“I think it speaks to the continuing popularity of casino gambling in the United States,” said David Schwartz, a gambling historian at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. “Despite some economic headwinds, casinos remain powerful drivers of economic activity.”Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at New Jersey's Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry, said money won by casinos is just part of their overall contribution to the nation's economy.Story continues“Casinos are often the largest employers in a region, with major commitments in terms of wages and benefits,” she said. “People employed by casinos use those wages and benefits to purchase additional goods and services, generating secondary economic impact.”Bokunewicz said casinos spend significant sums on operating costs, including purchases of goods and services like food, linen, hotel room amenities, laundry services, and building maintenance. They also hire local builders and vendors for construction and ongoing capital improvements.The survey examined money won from gamblers or spent at non-gambling casino businesses like restaurants and stores, including traditional casino games, sports betting and online gambling. Also surveyed was capital investment, including the building and opening of new casinos or renovations to existing ones, and spending by manufacturers of gambling devices including slot machines.It included supply chain spending by casinos, and spending by casino workers on non-gambling items. And it also included $13.5 billion in so-called catalytic spending by casino patrons outside casinos, on things like transportation to and from a casino resort, and money spent at restaurants that are not part of casinos.Commercial casinos employed almost 332,000 workers last year, who earned $16.3 billion in wages and benefits, and tribal casinos employed almost 265,000 workers, who earned $8 billion in wages and benefits. There also were almost 89,000 jobs at businesses serving casino patrons during trips or in casino construction and renovations, and more than 23,000 jobs at gambling equipment manufacturers.Non-gambling revenue accounted for nearly 17% of casino revenue last year, including money from food and beverage sales, hotel rooms and other items.___Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly known as Twitter, at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC",Yahoo
Ignacio Olivera Doll and Manuela Tobias,Argentina Central Bank Likely to Hold Rate Despite Inflation Spike,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s central bank board plans to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged Thursday despite inflation data hovering around a three-decade high, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkBrutality of Surprise Attack Unites Israel Around One Goal: Crush HamasXi’s Reply to Hamas Attack Shows China’s Limit as PeacemakerThe bank’s monetary policy committee will likely keep the Leliq rate at 118% at its weekly meeting because officials believe price pressures are showing signs of cooling in the past weeks, according to the people, who asked not to be named to discuss upcoming policy decisions.A spokesperson for the BCRA, as the central bank is known, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.Argentina’s monthly inflation averaged 12% over the past two months, the central bank said in a report published Monday, before the official release from statistics agency INDEC on Thursday. That’s slightly above the 11.3% monthly inflation expected for September by an average of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg, which puts annual price gains at 135%, the highest since the country was exiting hyperinflation in early 1990s.BCRA has refrained from boosting borrowing costs further after lifting them by 21 percentage points in mid-August, when the government ordered a sharp devaluation of the official exchange rate. Heightened volatility linked to Argentina’s upcoming presidential election on Oct. 22., coupled with a historic drought that cost the economy $20 billion of exports, has sent prices soaring and activity down as a recession looms.Read More: IMF’s $43 Billion Argentina Problem Is About to Get WorseOutsider candidate Javier Milei, who’s the frontrunner in the election after winning a primary in August, is openly pushing Argentines to get rid of their pesos as he advocates to dollarize the economy if elected.Story continuesDespite the central bank tightening monetary policy, the pressure on the Argentine currency continues as the black market exchange rate weakened to a record low of 945 pesos per dollar Monday and the gap between the official rate and informal rates reached 170%.

Will Daniel,"War in Israel, oil shocks, and roaring inflation, Deutsche Bank sees ‘a striking number of parallels’ with the 1970s","Hamas’s surprise attack against Israel has fanned the flames of an age-old conflict in the Middle East and sparked fears that the global economy faces a repeat of the turbulent 1970s. Almost exactly 50 years ago, an oil price shock caused by the Yom Kippur War and subsequent crude embargoes against nations that supported Israel in the conflict helped usher in a decade of stagflation—a toxic mix of weak economic growth and spiraling inflation. Now, as the current war in Israel continues to escalate, Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist Henry Allen can’t help but feel a sense of déjà vu.“As we look back at the 1970s today, there are a striking number of parallels with our own time,” the Wall Street veteran wrote in a Monday note. “Over the weekend, the attacks on Israel showed how geopolitical risk can return unexpectedly.”Anemic economic growth and crushing, stubborn inflation were the status quo in much of the 1970s—not just in the U.S., but worldwide. Between 1973 and 1983, as GDP growth rates plummeted in many nations, inflation averaged 11.3% globally, more than three times the average of the previous decade. Allen’s main fear is that we could see a repeat of this type of persistent inflation during the 2020s. He pointed to a number of reasons why he’s so concerned on Monday, from the threat of another oil price shock to growing “industrial unrest” from workers that can be seen in union strikes.Parallels to the 1970s""The most obvious parallel between the 2020s and the 1970s has been the surge in energy prices, particularly that of oil,"" according to Allen.The 1970s saw two major oil price shocks caused by wars in the Middle East that exacerbated inflation globally.The first came in October 1973, when OPEC, which then was called the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OAPEC, cut its oil production and imposed an embargo on a number of nations for supporting Israel in its fight against a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria during the Yom Kippur War. The move led the price of a barrel of oil to jump 300% from $2.90 to $11.65 in just four months.Story continuesSimilarly, the Russia-Ukraine war and subsequent sanctions against the West for its support of Ukraine lifted oil prices from around $80 per barrel at the start of 2022 to over $139 in just three months. Prices then slowly retreated to a low of around $74 this June, but supply-demand imbalances have led to a steady rise ever since. And the Israel-Hamas war threatens to bring back another bad memory from the 1970s—a second oil shock.In 1979, the Iranian Revolution crippled Iran’s oil production, reducing global crude output by roughly 7%. Then the Iran-Iraq War began in 1980, leading to further cuts in oil production. Crude prices rose from under $10 per barrel in early 1979 to $34 per barrel by February 1981 as a result.“These supply shocks caused serious difficulties for the economy, both in the 1970s and today, since they push up inflation and dampen growth at the same time,” Allen explained, noting that rising oil prices have put central banks in a tough spot as they continue their inflation fight amid fading global economic growth.However, Capital Economics’ deputy chief markets strategist Jonas Goltermann said he doesn’t believe the latest conflict in the Middle East will have as dramatic of an impact on oil prices as past wars have.""It would take a major escalation for this conflict to generate a shock comparable to the one in 1973 following the first Yom Kippur War. Back then the oil price quadrupled over the space of a few months; such an outcome remains a tail risk scenario,"" he wrote in a Monday note.Putting the potential for another oil price shock aside, Deutsche Bank’s Allen noted that inflation still remains well above central banks’ targets in many nations worldwide, just as it did in the 1970s. And in another repeat of history, economists may be a bit too optimistic about the path ahead for consumer prices.“Forecasts were repeatedly too optimistic in the 1970s, as the persistence of inflation was underestimated,” he wrote, explaining that there has been a “similar phenomenon” in the 2020s, which could lead central banks to be too dovish. “Now is not a time to get complacent…the 1970s showed how unexpected shocks could rapidly send inflation higher once again.”The number of striking workers is also on the rise in a repeat of the 1970s. Actors, screenwriters, autoworkers, journalists, and more have all taken drastic steps to push for higher wages to compensate for inflation in recent years.In the 1970s and early 1980s, U.S. workers regularly saw their wages rise by 7%, 8% or as much as 9% annually to compensate for rising prices. But some economists believe the persistent wage increases helped exacerbate inflation and fear current worker strikes could do the same.The good news, according to Allen, is “even as the number of strikes reaches its highest in decades, the scale of the industrial action is at just a fraction of its levels in the 1970s.”Still, striking workers and oil price shocks are definitely reminiscent of the disco era, and even the weather is feeling a lot like the ’70s. “We are also seeing an El Niño event this year, which echoes a similar event in the early 1970s that put upward pressure on food prices,” Allen warned, adding that “there is a clear risk that it could create another inflationary shock.”El Niño events can cause warmer and drier winters in North America, reducing crop yields.This year, the U.S. Climate Prediction Center estimates that there is a 73% chance that there will be a “strong” El Niño event.Reasons for optimismWhile there are certainly a lot of similarities between the 1970s and today, there are also a number of differences and reasons to believe the global economy can avoid stagflation.First, central banks around the world have raised interest rates aggressively to counter the rise of inflation, which was ultimately how consumer price increases were slowed in the early ’80s. Second, after years of supply-chain inflation, Allen said that supply chains have “broadly healed.” The New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index—which measures constraints caused by supply chains worldwide—has dropped back below its long-term average after hitting a record high in late 2021.Commodity prices, overall, are also still from their post-Russia invasion peak; consumers’ inflation expectations remain anchored; and the U.S. economy is far less energy intensive than it once was due to a number of factors, including a reduced emphasis on industrial production and new vehicle efficiency standards. U.S. energy intensity—a measure of primary energy consumption per real GDP dollar—has fallen nearly 80% since 1950, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.“An energy shock in the 1970s was capable of causing far more economic damage than today, because our economies were much more reliant on energy,” Allen explained.Summing it all up, the veteran strategist said that there have been “a lot of promising signs that a return to the 1970s can be avoided,” but the latest conflict in the Middle East means “it is too early to sound the all-clear.”“After all, inflation is still above target in every G7 country, even if it has come down from its peak. We saw in the 1970s how fresh shocks can lead to expectations becoming unanchored, particularly if they already follow a period where inflation has been above target. At the same time, growth remains sluggish in several countries, and relative to recent years, policymakers face more constraints when stimulating the economy,” he wrote.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo
Josh Schafer,Oil prices surge as surprise attack on Israel sparks fears of broader conflict,"Oil prices jumped more than 4% Monday morning after a surprise attack on Israel by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas fueled concerns of broader conflict breaking out in the Middle East region.West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent International (BZ=F) futures jumped about 4% to about $86 a barrel and $88 per barrel, respectively. The more than $3.50 rise in WTI crude oil marked the largest intraday move since April.Hamas over the weekend launched the biggest military assault on Israel in decades. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel's response to the attack will ""change the Middle East.""The Middle East accounts for more than 30% of the world's oil production.""There has been no oil supply disruption,"" Lipow Oil Associates president Andy Lipow wrote in a note on Monday morning. ""The oil market knee jerk reaction is to move higher on the fear that the conflict will spread, eventually drawing Iran into the conflict and impacting the transit of oil through the Strait of Hormuz.""Lipow noted that Iran's involvement will be key in determining how much the conflict could impact oil prices. The Strait of Hormuz, which is located between Oman and Iran, produces 17 million-18 million barrels of oil per day. If closed, that could result in a $20 to $30 per barrel increase in oil prices and a surge in gasoline prices in America.For now, though, Lipow believes the conflict won't impact gas prices' path downward.Oil prices have been in focus over the past several months as a surge at the end of September had some analysts calling for $100 per barrel prices amid a supply shock across the market. But those prices had receded recently as ""demand destruction"" had begun in energy.Fundstrat's head of research Tom Lee says the lack of oil demand should limit Monday's price spike.""Expect [oil] to initially rise on geopolitical risk, but demand is weak,"" Lee wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""So this will fade.""Story continuesOil's massive move higher had been flagged by many on the Street as a drag on the economy. Goldman Sachs called the headwind ""manageable"" while others were concerned about how rising oil prices, combined with other factors like the auto strike, the resumption of student loan payments, and a potential government shutdown, could hit growth.

Julia Fanzeres and Alex Longley,Oil Surges as Israel Conflict Reignites Middle East Volatility,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil prices surged after a shock attack on Israel by Hamas brought renewed instability to the Middle East.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkBrutality of Surprise Attack Unites Israel Around One Goal: Crush HamasXi’s Reply to Hamas Attack Shows China’s Limit as PeacemakerMore than 1,400 people have died since the fighting between Israel and militant group Hamas broke out over the weekend, in a conflict that has potential repercussions across the wider region. US crude futures settled above $86 a barrel, at one point rallying 5.4%.While Israel’s role in global oil supply is limited, the bloody outbreak threatens to embroil both the US and Iran. Iran has become a major source of extra crude this year, alleviating otherwise tightening markets, but additional American sanctions on Tehran could constrain those shipments.“Recently crude has been prone to overreact to geopolitical events and price increases have been short-lived,” said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. “This situation may prove to be the exception,” with the market especially sensitive to potential supply disruptions.Any retaliation against Tehran — amid reports that it helped to plan the attacks — could endanger the passage of vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital conduit that transports much of the world’s crude and which the Iranian government previously threatened to close. Iran denied on Monday that it was involved in the assault.The surge after the attacks added a fresh bout of volatility to a market that has seen sizable swings over the last month. In late September, Brent was on course to rally up to $100 a barrel as cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia tightened the market, before retreating sharply last week as concerns about consumption and financial flows pulled prices lower.Story continuesEarly trading on Monday saw a flurry of bullish activity in the Brent options markets, with call options that profit from higher oil prices outpacing — by more than three-to-one — bearish put options.Read More: What Oil Watchers Have to Say About Impact of Hamas’ AttacksThe conflict may have far-reaching consequences for crude. Banks had a wide range of takes on the potential impacts:Citigroup said the hostilities reduce expectations that Saudi Arabia will cut or eliminate its 1 million barrels-a-day of output curbs. Risks are also growing that Israel will attack Iran, analysts including Ed Morse said.Morgan Stanley said that they thought the impact of the conflict would be limited. For now they don’t expect a spillover into other countries, meaning there will be a muted longer-term impact on crude prices.Societe Generale SA said heightened geopolitical tensions could add $5-$10 risk premium to crude prices.RBC Capital Markets analysts including Helima Croft said Israel will likely escalate a long-running shadow war against Iran, but Tehran’s response to such a move will be less clear.To get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter into your inbox, click here.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraA Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Native Art Is a $1.5 Billion Market Plagued With ProblemsCan AI Beat the Market?

Craig Torres,"Jefferson Says Fed Can Proceed Carefully, Mindful of Yield Rise","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said he is watching the increase in Treasury yields as a potential further restraint on the economy even though the rate of inflation remains too high.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingA Fractured Israel Unites Around a Singular Goal: Crush the EnemyXi’s Reply to Hamas Attack Shows China’s Limit as PeacemakerBank of America’s Wrong-Way Rate Bet Hurts Moynihan’s Growth PledgeOfficials are “in a position to proceed carefully in assessing the extent of any additional policy firming that may be necessary,” Jefferson said Monday in a speech at a National Association for Business Economics conference in Dallas.“Looking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields and will keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy.”After raising the benchmark federal funds rate by more than five percentage points over the past year and a half, a majority of US central bankers at their September policy meeting projected it would be appropriate to enact one more quarter-point increase by the end of 2023.Yields on US government 10-year notes are up about 40 basis points since the September meeting. Fed officials including San Francisco’s Mary Daly and Lorie Logan of Dallas noted the recent tightening of financial conditions may substitute for additional rate hikes.“We are in a sensitive period of risk management, where we have to balance the risk of not having tightened enough, against the risk of policy being too restrictive,” Jefferson said.Futures markets show less than 20% chance of a 25 basis-point increase at the upcoming Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, and similar odds on a hike at the final meeting of the year in December.Answering questions after his speech, the vice chair said he wouldn’t want to prejudge how the Fed would respond to economic developments.Story continues“Our responsibility is to bring inflation down to 2% and to be nimble with regards to what may or may not be happening in the economy as we go forward,” Jefferson said. “I would want the public to know that we’re going to be mindful, whatever is happening, and we will use data in real time to pick an appropriate response.”In spite of rising borrowing costs, the US economy has shown surprising resilience. The labor market added 336,000 jobs in September, according to fresh data published Friday.Jefferson in his speech listed risks on both sides of the outlook, from the potential impact of slower growth in China and Europe on the US to a labor market that might remain “too strong to achieve further disinflation.”--With assistance from Edward Dufner.(Updates with additional comments from Jefferson beginning in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraA Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Native Art Is a $1.5 Billion Market Plagued With ProblemsCan AI Beat the Market?

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,2 Federal Reserve officials say spike in bond yields may allow central bank to leave rates alone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Monday that the central bank may leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting in three weeks because a surge in long-term interest rates has made borrowing more expensive and could help cool inflation without further action by the Fed.Since late July, the yield, or rate, on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has jumped from around 4% to about 4.8%, a 16-year high. The run-up in the yield has inflated other borrowing costs and raised the national average 30-year mortgage rate to 7.5%, according to Freddie Mac, a 23-year high. Business borrowing costs have also risen as corporate bond yields have accelerated.Philip Jefferson, vice chair of the Fed's board and a close ally of Chair Jerome Powell, said in a speech Monday to the National Association for Business Economics that he would “remain cognizant” of the higher bond rates and “keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy.”U.S. stock prices reversed their losses after Jefferson's comments. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% in late trading.Jefferson's comments followed a speech to the NABE earlier in the day by Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee. She also indicated that higher long-term bond rates could help serve the central bank's efforts to slow inflation to its 2% target.Since March of last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark short-term rate 11 times, from near zero to roughly 5.4%. The rate hikes have been intended to defeat the worst bout of inflation in more than 40 years. But they have also led to much higher borrowing rates and sparked worries that they could trigger a recession.“If long-term interest rates remain elevated"" because investors are increasingly concerned about the risks of holding long-term bonds, ""there may be less need to raise the fed funds rate,” Logan said, referring to the Fed's benchmark rate. Bond rates rise when investors find them riskier to buy or hold.Story continuesAnd last Thursday, Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that if longer-term interest rates remain high, “the need for us to take further action is diminished.”The Fed officials' remarks coincide with increasing expectations in financial markets that the Fed will skip rate hikes at its meeting Nov. 1, as well as at the following meeting Dec. 13, and simply leave its benchmark rate at its current high level through the end of this year. Futures markets have priced in only a 12% chance of a rate hike in November and 26% in December, both significantly lower than on Friday, when a surprisingly robust jobs report was released.Fed officials have not pushed back against those expectations in their remarks, a sign they may not disagree with them at the moment.“There’s this growing sense of comfort among Fed officials with the July rate hike having been the last one in this tightening cycle and now focusing on how long to keep monetary policy at the current restrictive level,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, the accounting and consulting firm.One issue that economists and Fed officials are trying to determine is what factors are pushing longer-term rates higher. The Fed's rate hikes themselves don't automatically translate into higher longer-run borrowing costs, such as the 10-year Treasury yield. Market forces, expectations for future inflation and for future economic growth also affect yields.Logan noted that if longer-term rates are rising mostly because investors expect the economy to grow more quickly in the future, the Fed might have to keep lifting their short-term rate to cool the economy. But analysts increasingly think that the 10-year rate is rising because investors see greater volatility in inflation and the economy and consider holding longer-term bonds to be more risky. In that case, the Fed doesn't necessarily have to do more to cool the economy.Another issue bedeviling Fed officials is how long it may take from the time they hike short-term rates until those higher rates impact the economy. The economist Milton Friedman said in the 1960s that the Fed's policies work with “long and variable lags,” and yet now Fed officials disagree with how long they are.Logan, like Fed governor Christopher Waller, said she thinks much of the impact of the Fed's rate increases have already occurred, as businesses have reacted quickly because Powell and other Fed officials issued clear warnings that rates were likely to rise quickly.But Jefferson noted the large amount of corporate debt that was refinanced at very low interest rates during the pandemic, and said that businesses would have to refinance it in coming years at higher rates, potentially slowing growth.Jefferson said that when thinking about future interest rate decisions, he would have to keep in mind all the rate hikes the Fed has imposed, that have yet to hit the economy, “and that could influence what I think should happen next.”",Yahoo
Alex Longley and Devika Krishna Kumar,Middle East Conflict Spurs Bullish Rush in Oil Options Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Bullish oil options contracts surged in value as the conflict between Israel and Hamas injected a fresh dose of volatility into a market that already had seen huge swings over the last week.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingA Fractured Israel Unites Around a Singular Goal: Crush the EnemyBank of America’s Wrong-Way Rate Bet Hurts Moynihan’s Growth PledgeIsrael Latest: Over 1,100 Dead; US Sends Warships to RegionCall options, which profit from higher prices, surged relative to bearish put contracts for the Brent global crude benchmark on Monday. The difference between the two, known as the skew, was on track for its biggest one-day move since March 2022, when oil prices rocketed in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Oil prices in New York surged as much as 5.4% on Monday as the conflict threatened political stability in the wider Middle East — the latest sharp swing in an oil market that has seen a tumultuous few weeks. Late last month, prices looked set to rally to $100 a barrel, before an ensuing sharp slump, driven by financial flows and demand concerns, saw them shed about $10 over a week.The tumble led to a surge in options volatility last week as traders who had positioned for higher prices rushed to cover themselves when oil fell. That had caused the skew to surge in favor of puts, but the move reversed Monday.The price shift also showed up in volumes, with call trading outpacing that of puts significantly on Monday. About 154,000 Brent calls traded by 11:27am in New York, compared with 52,000 put options.

Logan said “there is a clear role for increased term premiums in recent yield curve moves,” though “the size and persistence of the contribution are subject to uncertainty.”Read More: How Rising Rates, US Debt Brought Back Term Premiums: QuickTakeOn the other hand, “to the extent that strength in the economy is behind the increase in long-term interest rates,” the central bank may need to tighten more, Logan said.Fed officials are trying to decide whether they need to hike their benchmark federal funds rate again this year after raising it by more than five percentage points over the last 19 months. The yield on 30-year Treasury securities rose above 5% last week, the highest since 2007, amid an ongoing adjustment in markets to the Fed’s message that rates are likely to remain higher for longer than previously thought.Better BalanceSpeaking separately at an American Bankers Association event Monday, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr downplayed results of a monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report published Oct 6, which showed stronger-than expected employment growth in September.Story continues“There are important elements of the labor market that are showing that labor supply and labor demand are coming into better balance,” Barr said, citing cooler wage growth. “The picture is one that is showing that we have made significant progress on bringing inflation towards the direction we want.”Answering questions after her speech, Logan argued “we have more work to do, and I think restrictive financial conditions will be will be needed for some time.”“The most important thing is that we stay focused on on restoring price stability, and I think that will require some rebalancing in the labor market,” she said.Investors currently see less-than-even odds of another rate increase this year, according to futures. Logan’s comments Monday jibed with recent remarks from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who suggested on Oct. 5 that “if financial conditions, which have tightened considerably in the past 90 days, remain tight, the need for us to take further action is diminished.”(Updates with Barr’s comments in seventh paragraph.

Alaric Nightingale,What Oil Traders Are Watching After Shock Attack on Israel,"(Bloomberg) -- The shock attack by Hamas and Israel’s response risk a wider destabilization of the region — and the global oil market is watching.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingIsrael Latest: Over 1,100 Dead; US Sends Warships to RegionBank of America’s Wrong-Way Rate Bet Hurts Moynihan’s Growth PledgeStocks Shrug Off Losses After Fedspeak; Oil Climbs: Markets WrapThere are sprawling questions about the geopolitical consequences of the conflict, which erupted 50 years after the Yom Kippur war that foreshadowed the 1970s oil crisis.There is no suggestion that the fallout from the current situation will be comparable to what happened back then, but it could alter the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East in unpredictable ways. Israel has broadly pointed the finger at Iran following the attack. Tehran has denied involvement but President Ebrahim Raisi called it a “victory.”Before the weekend, Saudi Arabia had been close to a deal with Israel that could have brought increased stability to the region. The US and Iran were engaged in broad but largely unacknowledged efforts to reach a kind of detente, and with it higher oil flows.Many of the geopolitical considerations will hinge on how far Israel takes its response — particularly with regard to Iran. For now, these are the most immediate considerations for oil traders:1. Sanctions EnforcementThere is a widely held belief in the oil market that the US has turned something of a blind eye to sanctions on Iran’s oil flows, allowing shipments to soar in recent months.That has helped keep a lid on oil prices in a market that has seen a huge loss of supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of OPEC+.There is a chance that the US could take aim at this trade. The Islamic Republic currently sells the bulk of its crude exports to China, sending 1.5 million barrels a day — the most in a decade — in August, according to data intelligence firm Kpler.Story continuesIt’s hard to be sure how much control the US can really exert. Since Iranian sanctions were re-imposed in 2018, sales to Chinese customers have increasingly been transacted in yuan, or via barter trade, and executed by local banks to circumvent western restrictions. Oil is transported on Iran’s own tankers or so-called dark fleet vessels, using a supply chain that US authorities can’t easily control.Any outcome that cuts Iran’s oil flow could boost demand for Russia’s barrels — an undesirable outcome for Washington or other Group of Seven nations trying to cut Moscow’s access to petrodollars.What’s more, any move to clamp down would tighten the oil market, a big decision to take going into an election year in the US.2. Hormuz DisturbanceThe Strait of Hormuz connects oil producing countries in the Persian Gulf to refineries all over the world.It is a transit point for one in every six barrels that the world consumes, and a stretch of water over which Iran has often claimed dominion. It’s vital to the global energy market.For now, there’s no sign Tehran is moving to disrupt merchant shipping — something it has done in recent times, often in tit-for-tat measures.Hormuz has never truly halted. Not in the Tanker War of 1984 in which Iran and Iraq would routinely attack each other’s oil carriers, and not in more recent times when Tehran stepped up vessel seizures and harassment of merchant shipping.Halting Hormuz hurts Iran’s allies. That doesn’t mean it can’t be significantly disrupted — even to the point of disrupting the flow of oil — bit it’s hard to see it being fully stopped.Beyond the strait, there have also been instances in recent years where Iran’s own oil shipments have been intercepted and disrupted by western powers — another source of potential disruption in an escalation.3. How Wide?The readout from the conflict for the oil market rests very much on what Israel does in the coming days, weeks and months.What Oil Watchers Have to Say About Impact of Hamas’ AttacksIran is a “very big wild card” and there will a focus on how strongly Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blames Tehran for facilitating the attacks, RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts including Helima Croft said in a note.4. Strategic ReleasesIf the conflict ultimately spirals into something that affects oil supply, or boosts oil prices for a prolonged period, it would be a justification for the US government to further sell barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.That could quell short-term oil price moves, but it would nevertheless leave the US needing to replenish its stockpile at some point in the future.5. History as a GuideFor all of these risks, there is nevertheless a chance that this war ultimately proves to be immaterial for the oil market.Turmoil in the region in recent times hasn’t been a catalyst for structural moves higher in oil prices.

"Gabriel Sanchez, Redd Brown, Rachel Phua and Ignacio Gonzalez","JPMorgan, Citi Prepare for Fed’s Higher-For-Longer Approach: US Earnings Week Ahead","(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expected to have outperformed Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. in profitability when the three banks report quarterly earnings this week, though all lenders face challenges from a slow economy and high interest rates.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Biden Says at Least 11 Americans Have Been KilledSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingIsrael Latest: Over 1,100 Dead; US Sends Warships to RegionStocks Shrug Off Losses After Fedspeak; Oil Climbs: Markets WrapJPMorgan and its peers are seen bolstering loan-loss provisions further amid the lingering possibility that the US could slip into recession as early as this year. A “blowout” jobs report last week raised the likelihood the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again, further constraining net interest income growth and highlighting the need to lower business costs.Quarterly reports from PepsiCo Inc., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Domino’s Pizza Inc. will underscore the dwindling spending power of American consumers, who now hold less cash in hand than they did before the pandemic.Monday: No earnings of note.Tuesday: Pepsi (PEP US) earnings are seen rising 9.4%, slowing after two quarters of double-digit gains. Concerns that cost-conscious customers will switch to cheaper brands may be overstated, Goldman Sachs said, noting that PepsiCo enjoys a “favorable geographic footprint” over rivals. However, BI said unfavorable foreign-exchange rates likely crimped quarterly revenue growth. Pepsi, which has the capacity to take on $10 billion of debt without hurting its credit profile, could be looking to further grow its portfolio of snack brands; the company had shown interest in buying Hostess Brands, which was eventually sold to J.M. Smucker.Wednesday: No earnings of note.Thursday: Walgreens Boots’ (WBA US) adjusted earnings per share likely shrank 14% in the quarter, with Jefferies analysts expecting continued pressure on the profitability of its US retail pharmacy segment, the company’s largest money maker. Operational issues with VillageMD, a clinic operator in which Walgreens has a controlling stake, also likely weighed on performance. Analysts are calling Walgreen’s 2024 and 2025 guidance into question amid the drugstore chain’s recent C-suite shakeout.Story continuesDelta Air Lines (DAL US) has seen estimates for its third-quarter adjusted earnings revised downwards as higher fuel and labor costs bite. The carrier’s four-year contract with its pilots, signed in March, will further erode margins at a time when slowing domestic demand is also squeezing passenger yield, BI said.Domino’s Pizza’s (DPZ US) domestic same-store sales growth was flat in the quarter from a year ago, dragged down by fewer delivery orders, BI said. A revamped loyalty program and a new partnership with Uber Eats could help in the fourth quarter, though the worsening global consumer environment will continue to weigh on earnings, Barclays said.Friday: JPMorgan (JPM US) is set to post the fastest earnings-per-share growth among major US investment banks this reporting season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net interest income likely jumped 27% in the period, offsetting declines in trading revenues and investment-banking fees. The bank could beat its full-year NII guidance, defying the impact of persistently higher interest rates, said Piper Sandler. JPMorgan’s third-quarter report is due pre-market.Citigroup (C US) earnings likely fell 18%, while Wells Fargo’s (WFC US) are projected to decline 3.6%. Expenses and efficiencies will be under increased scrutiny in both reports, which are due before the opening bell. Rising operating costs are outpacing Citi’s revenue growth and weighing on profitability, even as the bank prepares to overhaul its organizational structure, BI said. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has reiterated its full-year expense outlook but also has opportunities for more efficiencies, Piper Sandler said.PNC Financial Services (PNC US) could say more about this month’s purchase of a $17 billion portfolio of capital-commitment facilities from Signature Bank, on its third-quarter earnings call. The deal should add around 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter without materially impacting PNC’s capital ratios, RBC Capital Markets said. Earnings and revenue likely shrank in the third quarter, with net interest margin down for the first time after six straight quarters of growth.BlackRock’s (BLK US) adjusted earnings are projected to fall 11% from a year ago, as the firm faces challenges from slowing institutional flows and foreign-currency headwinds, Citi analysts said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraCan AI Beat the Market?

Josh Schafer,A key inflation gauge and bank earnings: What to know this week,"A crucial inflation print and the start of third quarter earnings season are set to greet investors in the week ahead.The economic highlight will come on Thursday morning, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September will be released. The report is expected to show a small decrease in headline inflation.Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting are also expected to provide further insight on the path forward for monetary policy and a reading of consumer sentiment will close out the week.On the corporate side, Pepsi (PEP), Delta (DAL), and JPMorgan (JPM) will highlight the start of third quarter earnings season. Reports from Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BlackRock (BLK) are expected on Friday.Monday is a bond market holiday, meaning there will be no bids on Treasury yields, which have been at the top of investor focus over the past week. However, the US stock market will still be open.Stocks enter the week largely higher after a blowout September jobs report sent stocks roaring on Friday, negating a bond yield-driven sell-off earlier in the week. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) climbed nearly 1.6% while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.5%. Both rises marked the best week in the past five for the indexes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.3%.A hot September jobs report has further complicated the Fed's next move.The details of the report could have positives for the Fed. On a month-over-month basis, hourly wage growth came in cooler than the expected at 0.2% for the second straight month. The yearly wage growth of 4.2% was the slowest annual pace since June 2021.Broadly though, the 334,000 nonfarm payroll additions was unavoidably hot compared to what economists had expected. And that adds upside risks to further rate hikes, according to economists, as the hot job market needs to be met with cooling inflation in order to stay on pace for a coveted ""soft landing.""""While we’re sticking with our call for rates on hold, if today’s number is followed by hot inflation data the Fed may get pulled into another hike,"" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note on Friday. ""And if that happens the already-tenuous case for avoiding recession next year gets harder to make.""Story continues Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023, in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo)Third quarter earnings season begins this week, with specific focus on what some of the nation's largest financial institutions have to say about the state of the consumer and the overall health of the US economy.Wall Street is expecting the financials sector to report year-over-year earnings growth of 8.7%, the fourth-highest growth rate out of all 11 sectors, per FactSet. Strategists believe bank stocks could provide key insight into how corporate America is dealing with the higher interest rate environment.""[Bank stocks] need to participate in any recovery rally in order to validate the notion that higher interest rates do not doom the US economy to a recession next year. If you are very bullish here, this is the group for you,"" DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.Pepsi and Delta will provide a look at consumer demand. Pepsi will be one of the first consumer brands to report since reports about weight loss drugs bringing down demand for snacks sank stocks in the sector last week.Leading into Friday's jobs report, bond yields rose to 16-year highs. The rising yields unsettled investors already fearful of the impact of further rate hikes and sent stocks lower. But the bond-induced sell-off might not have been all bad.For one, it could keep the Fed on pause in November as some economists and Fed officials believe the rise in bonds might've already done the credit-tightening work for the central bank.""Were it not for the significant tightening in financial conditions (more than two 25bp hikes in fed funds equivalent), this report might support the additional hike foreseen in the Fed's September projections,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote in a note on Friday.And while the tightening itself could still be a concern for investors, it might have opened up markets for a new catalyst.Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel says the past week's ""bondfire of the volatilities"" provided a buying opportunity for stocks.""As much focus as there is on Yields right now, earnings season begins in a week and the flip side of unanticipated 3Q economic strength is that 3Q earnings will likely surprise to the upside,"" Emanuel wrote in a note on Friday.

Alicia Adamczyk,Financial experts say we need to stop living in a ‘YOLO economy.’ They share 5 ways to rein in spending,"This summer, I saw many of my favorite artists in concert, took trips I'll not soon forget, and started upgrading my wardrobe for the return to office. It was gratifying to be back in community with other fans, to be part of cultural moments that were few and far between in recent years, and to spend time out in the world with the people I love.It was also, well, expensive. I don't regret the money I paid, but as the weather starts to cool off here in New York (or at least hints at cooling off), it feels like the right time to recalibrate my budget and dial back my spending as well.I'm likely not the only one who feels this way. Consumer spending has been strong over the past few years, with retail, travel, and experience spending particularly robust. Despite the Federal Reserve's best efforts, Americans spent 5.8% more in August 2023 than they did last year.Though Americans haven't been under stay-at-home orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic in years, there is still a pervading sense that we're catching up on things we missed—or that tomorrow isn't guaranteed, so you might as well spend today, says Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.""We’re in a YOLO economy,"" says Samana, referring to the acronym for ""you only live once."" ""We should be in an intermittent fasting economy to save up for the recession.""This fall is a great time to check in on your finances even if you haven't been overspending. For almost 44 million, October brings the first additional multi-hundred dollar bill each month, as federal student loans are due again. Credit card debt has surpassed $1 trillion, a record high. And gas prices have been soaring.Interest rates have also been creeping up, as the Fed tries to rein in inflation, partially caused by all that spending. A recession hasn't materialized, but if you're anything like me, you're always a little worried it could, leading to job loss or general anxiety.Story continuesWith all of those macro—and personal—headwinds at play, here's what financial advisors suggest to work on for your financial peace of mind.Reassess your budgetLook, no one likes to hear it, but actually understanding where your money is going is crucial to getting a handle on it. With the price of just about everything on a seemingly neverending upward spiral, it's important to take stock of what you're paying and to whom.For example: You probably know what subscriptions you pay for, but do you know how much you're paying? Many have increased costs recently. If you're going to the office more and use public transportation, is it time to opt back into your company's commuter benefits program?""Take a close look at your checking and credit card accounts and examine every purchase, charge, and expense to determine what was a necessary purchase and where you may have overspent on something unnecessary, your 'needs' versus your 'wants,'"" says Mary Hines Droesch, head of consumer and small business products at Bank of America. ""This can help you determine some areas where you may be able to cut back your spending in the 'wants' category as you reevaluate your habits and priorities.""There are a number of programs you can use to track your household's spending. Software like Mint and You Need a Budget are particularly popular, and there are online communities you can join to get more insight into them.Create an ""honest list"" of your assets, debts, and upcoming large expenses, suggests Kelly Palmer, founder and chief wealth officer of The Wealthy Parent, a financial planning firm in Chicago. ""If you are in a relationship, this is a hugely important step to take with your partner,"" Palmer says. ""Fall is a great time to reconnect with your partner financially before the stress of the holidays sets in.""Personally, I track my savings and investments in a Google spreadsheet; I'll be adding on my daily spending this month to get a fuller picture. I also get text alerts of all of my credit card swipes and daily updates with my balances, which you can do by logging into your account on your bank or credit card company's website.Prioritize certain spendingWhen I've strayed from my financial goals, I like to reset with a No Spend month. During these periods, I cut out on non-essential purchases or follow other pre-determined rules I've made.""While it may seem like a drastic step, think of it as the equivalent of putting your spending on an elimination diet to see what you can truly live without,"" says Hines Droesch.A No Spend month can be helpful because it's a temporary reset. But reassessing your budget doesn't mean cutting back on all discretionary spending long term. In fact, doing so can often backfire.""Give yourself permission to spend a little on 'fun stuff,'"" says Hines Droesch. ""Applying the 50/30/20 method to any budget is a universal way of ensuring the proper amounts of your income is going to saving and investing while leaving enough room to enjoy your hard-earned money.""The 50/30/20 budget is a popular method of divvying up expenses. Following it, 50% of your after-tax income goes toward needs, like your housing payment, student loans, groceries, etc. Another 30% goes toward wants, and 20% goes toward savings (including investments).""By living below your means, you’ll lay the groundwork for a lifetime of financial progress,"" says Hines Droesch. ""When you treat savings as mandatory, you make it that much easier to stay serious about achieving financial stability.""Pay down credit card debtThough student loan debt has gotten a lot of attention lately, credit card debt is often a bigger headache for the consumers who have it. The interest rate is likely to be higher, and it can be more predatory. That's why if you've accrued some, it's critical to focus on paying that down ASAP, says Andrea Woroch, a family-budgeting expert.That's doubly true in the current environment because not only has consumer credit card debt hit a record high, but so have interest rates: The average credit card APR in September hit 24.45%, according to LendingTree, with 35% of cards charging as high as 29.99%.Of course, many of these steps are easier said than done. What's helped me focus on these types of goals is finding others in a similar boat. There are Facebook groups and subreddits related to personal finance that can inspire you to stick to your budget, and TikTokers (like Jamie Feldman, whom I profiled here) chronicling their debt payoff journeys. If you're only watching content that encourages you to spend, or talks about how pointless or difficult saving is, it's hard to make changes. But seeing or reading about others do it can be the encouragement you need.If you qualify, look into a 0% balance transfer. With these offers, a credit card company allows you to use a new card to pay off a credit card balance you have with another company, often with a 0% interest rate for a set amount of months. So if you have 0% for 24 months, you have two years to pay down your balance without more interest accruing. That can help you become debt free, or at least make substantial inroads.Think long termAs a millennial with a propensity to doom scroll, it can often feel silly to prioritize saving and investing when the future is so uncertain. That's a popular sentiment among younger generations: 45% of workers aged 18 to 35 don’t see the point of saving for retirement ""until things return to normal,"" a 2022 report from Fidelity found.I won't pretend to know what the future holds. But one thing that's helped me is the realization that no matter what happens, there likely won't come a time when I wish I had less money saved.One thirty-something put it to me as saving in a ""nihilism fund."" Focusing on what you can control in an uncertain world can be empowering.Get helpIf you're struggling to make your budget work, there are ways to ask for help.For example, if you have federal student loans, an income-driven repayment plan may help lower your monthly payment. The new SAVE plan is particularly generous. You can apply on the Department of Education's website.If credit card debt is stressing you out, you might be able to negotiate your interest rate, consolidate your debt, or get on a payment plan. Set aside an afternoon to call your credit card company to see how they can help you.""If you’re struggling, communicate with creditors and work with them on paying down your debt,"" says Brandon Robinson, president and founder of Texas-based financial firm JBR Associates. ""Many are willing to be flexible.""Another option is to work with a credit counseling company, which can give you advice and help you develop a budget and repayment plan. Just remember: Most reputable credit counseling organizations are nonprofits—check with your local credit union or even a university to find one that won't overcharge you.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo
The Economist,A jobs bonanza stirs fears the American economy is overheating,"The american economy is supposed to be slowing down by now, and that is supposed to be translating into a weaker labour market. But according to figures released on October 6th, the country added 336,000 jobs in September, nearly twice as many as forecast and the most since January (see chart). It is the latest evidence that, despite an aggressive series of interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve over the past 18 months, American growth remains resilient. Instead of the “hard-landing” forecasts that predicted a recession, and were so common earlier this year, America looks to be heading for something more like a “no-landing” scenario. Underlying the data release is a vexing question, about whether the labour-market resilience is excessive, and will therefore place upward pressure on inflation. If so, Fed policymakers will be tempted to resume their interest-rate rises before long. In recent weeks financial markets have moved sharply to price in the possibility that rates will remain elevated for an extended period—or, to use the terminology now favoured, stay “higher for longer”—owing to the Fed’s protracted fight against inflation. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds have soared since August to around 4.8%, their highest in more than 15 years, which represents a swift tightening of financial conditions.Initial reactions to the strong jobs data fell into the good-news-is-bad-news mould. In the minutes after the release, yields on Treasuries jumped yet higher, reflecting bets that the Fed may raise rates again as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for the end of this month. That, in turn, weighed on stockmarkets globally.However, as analysts and investors digested the numbers, worries about the outlook for rates gave way to optimism about the broader economy, because the employment report also offered pretty positive signals about inflation. Average hourly earnings—a proxy for wage growth—were up 0.2% month-on-month in September, the slowest monthly rise since early 2022. In year-on-year terms, earnings growth of 4.2% dipped to its weakest since mid-2021. Alongside a recent deceleration in inflation, an ebbing of wage pressures will reassure the Fed that prices are trending in the desired direction.Story continuesA separate batch of labour-market data published at the same time—based on a survey of households rather than businesses—also painted a more restrained picture. It showed that just 86,000 jobs were added last month. With 90,000 people entering the workforce at the same time, the unemployment rate remained perfectly steady at 3.8%, which is low by historical standards but a touch higher than a few months ago. All this suggests that the labour market has gone from being ultra-tight to just moderately tight. Viewed in such a light, America’s economic resilience would appear to be impressive, not excessive.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

Josh Schafer,September jobs report shows US economy remains stronger than Wall Street thinks,"A monthly jobs report just blew out expectations, and the US economy remains in a familiar position. In September, 334,000 nonfarm payrolls were added to the labor market, nearly double the consensus estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg and the highest monthly addition since January.The odds of a Fed rate hike, as measured by investor bets on the CME FedWatch Tool, ticked higher to a 30% chance the central bank boosts rates in November, up from a 18% chance last week.And some Wall Street economists think Friday's report was one of the last signs of strength before the Fed's historically fast tightening cycle finally grabs hold of the elusive US consumer.""Despite all the excitement around the September report, we don’t exclude the possibility of a negative payroll print before year-end,"" EY chief economist Greg Daco wrote in a research note on Friday.Daco cited the United Auto Workers strike, ""easing consumer spending,"" and more ""cautious business activity"" as factors that will slow labor demand in the months ahead. The firm boosted its odds for a recession in the next 12 months to 50% from 40%. A sign hangs in front of US flags outside of the New York Stock Exchange in New York Sept. 1, 2015. (Lucas Jackson/REUTERS)The warning signs are still looming over the economy. Daco at EY calls them the ""quadruple threat."" High oil prices have hit consumer confidence. A strike from auto workers is ongoing, the resumption of student loan payments is expected to weigh on consumer wallets, and now a potential government shutdown is back in play.Add in how elevated interest rates could weigh on both consumers and corporates, and the case for lagging impacts from monetary policy is still prevalent.But even as the wall of worry builds once more, investors don't seem to be buying it as stocks rallied into the afternoon on Friday.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo
Myles Udland,One thing stands between the US labor market and a full recovery from the pandemic,"Back in August 2022, the number of people employed in the US officially overtook pre-pandemic highs reached in February 2020.But the headline recovery in the labor market papered over weakness that remained in the industries hardest hit by the pandemic. Namely, restaurants and hotels.The September jobs report showed employment in the accommodations industry — which covers hotels — remains the last major holdout in restoring the labor market to its pre-pandemic status.In September, employment in the food services and drinking places industry rose by 61,000, returning this industry to its February 2020 level. As of September, 12,368,400 people worked in this industry; in February 2020, 12,338,900 people were employed in this line of work.Accommodations employment, in contrast, stood 10.3% below levels that prevailed just before the pandemic. Last month, the industry added 16,000 workers, bringing the employment total for this industry to 1,895,500; in February 2020, there were 2,054,500 people employed in this industry.

Alexandra Canal,"Hollywood strikes have cost the US economy 45,000 jobs since May","The US economy added a stunning 336,000 jobs in September, nearly double the 170,000 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected — but the Hollywood strikes registered yet another hit to the jobs report last month as the writers strike reached its conclusion while the actors strike is still ongoing.According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Friday morning, employment in motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by another 7,000 after falling by 17,000 in August, ""reflecting the impact of labor disputes.""Since the strikes first began in May, employment in those industries has declined by 45,000. According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 writers strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion. That likely will double this time around.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the nearly five-month-long writers strike, coupled with the ongoing actors strike, will cost the national economy $5 billion-plus.""The main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages,"" Klowden previously told Yahoo Finance Live.

Hamza Shaban,How the Fed's 'higher for longer' rate hikes will squeeze the US government,"Even small moves in interest rates can have big impacts on deficits.That's why the surge in bond yields has fueled concerns over the Federal Reserve and government debt, and what deficit watchers see as a looming crisis spelled out in budget lines.Earlier this week the yield on 10-year Treasuries (^TNX) surpassed levels not seen in more than 15 years, rising just above 4.8%. While yields fell slightly on Thursday, they remain elevated, holding over 4.5% for nearly two weeks. Their climb accelerated in recent weeks after the Fed signaled it would raise rates once more before the end of the year. Investors are also grappling with signs that the central bank will keep rates higher for longer as the Fed struggles to yank inflation down to its 2% target. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference in Washington, D.C., Sep. 20, 2023. (Aaron Schwartz/Xinhua via Getty Images)Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington think tank, pointed to an array of policies to combat Washington's fiscal challenges, including tax reform, raising the retirement age, and changes to immigration policy. ""We can't grow our way out of this but growth can help us get out of this,"" he said.Emergency borrowing during the initial, chaotic phase of the COVID public health crisis came cheap for the government. The Fed kicked into rescue mode and lowered interest rates to avoid a depression. Inflation wasn't an issue then either. But Goldwein noted that while such investments may have seemed cheap at the time, there wasn't a plan to pay for the borrowed money. That means the government's low-interest debt is rolling over into high-interest debt, in addition to Washington taking on altogether new debt, he said.The CRFB estimates that nearly 60% of government debt originated when the average interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes was less than 3%. And more than half of all debt will mature in the next three years.Regarding that low-cost borrowing as a free pass was ""a huge error that we are paying for,"" Goldwein said.Even as some budgetary hawks sound the alarm, other observers don't see a catastrophe waiting to happen. Nathan Tankus, the research director of the Modern Money Network, a nonprofit that runs educational programs about money and economics, said that dire projections of astronomical interest expenses don't account for the ways those government payments will influence GDP. And if the forecasts are as stark and disastrous as hawks say they are, he said, the budgetary calamity would force the Fed to act, since price stability would come under threat.Tankus, who is writing a book about the Federal Reserve, also points out that concerns over growing debt payments tied to rising interest rates is a reason to rethink the Fed's limited and in some ways crude toolbox for combating inflation.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Rising long-term interest rates are posing the latest threat to a US economic 'soft landing',"WASHINGTON (AP) — Surging interest rates are intensifying the challenges for the U.S. economy and threatening to derail the Federal Reserve’s drive to tame inflation without causing a deep recession.Since mid-summer, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for many loans, has steadily climbed, causing a spillover rise in other borrowing costs. The costs of mortgages, auto loans and credit card debt have all risen in response. The collective impact of higher rates across the economy could also weaken the government's own finances.The jump in longer-term rates coincides with other threats, from higher gas prices and this week's resumption of student loan payments to autoworkers’ ongoing strike and the risk of a government shutdown next month, all of which could leave consumers with less money to spend to power the economy.The strike by the United Auto Workers, now in its third week with no resolution in sight, could reduce vehicle sales in coming months. And the threat of a government shutdown, narrowly averted this past weekend, looms large, especially given the chaos over the leadership of the House of Representatives. Far-right Republican House members deposed their leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, on Tuesday for working with Democrats to temporarily avoid a shutdown.The economy is coming off a robust summer, fueled by strong consumer spending on travel, concert tours and movie blockbusters. The economy is estimated to have grown at a healthy 3.5% annual rate in the July-September quarter, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.Yet growth will likely slow to a meager 0.7% annual rate in the final three months of the year, Goldman estimates. With borrowing rates high and inflation still relatively elevated, consumers, who drive about 70% of economic growth, are expected to spend more cautiously.On Friday, the government will provide a snapshot of how employers are factoring the turmoil into their hiring plans when it issues the September jobs report. Economists have forecast that it will show that employers added a solid 162,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate dipped to 3.7%, near a half-century low, from 3.8%.Story continuesBut the substantial rise in borrowing costs could intensify the economy's slowdown. The yield on the 10-year Treasury touched a 16-year high of 4.8% on Tuesday, up from 3.3% in April. Last week, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage hit 7.3%, the highest rate in 23 years, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.On Tuesday, Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said she and other Fed policymakers will have to consider the rise in long-term rates in deciding whether to raise their key rate once more before year's end. Her remarks suggested that the higher borrowing costs might lead the Fed to forgo another hike.“That will influence not only our policy decisions but how the economy evolves over the next year,” Mester said. “Those tighter, higher rates will have an impact on the economy.”Financial analysts point to several reasons for the rapid increase in lending rates. To begin with, the Fed has repeatedly underscored that it intends to keep its key rate elevated for much longer than financial markets had expected earlier this year. And the economy's ability to keep growing, even as the Fed has jacked up rates, has lent the impression that it can withstand higher borrowing costs.The economy's resilience in the face of higher rates could mean that borrowing costs will stay higher than they did after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, which led the Fed to cut its rate to near zero. During that period, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to as low as 1.5%, and mortgage rates even fell below 3% during the pandemic.The Treasury Department is now also auctioning off more debt to cover the government's swelling budget deficit, which reached $1.5 trillion this year and is expected to rise further in 2024. The supply of Treasurys is growing even as the Fed is reducing its holding of bonds. Overseas buyers have reduced their purchases, thereby forcing rates higher to attract buyers.“All of that is driving these fears of higher rates, and no one knows when it’s going to stop,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities.Benson Durham, a former Fed economist who is head of global policy at Piper Sandler, suggested that long-term rates are rising because investors consider it riskier to hold government debt for the long run when the economy appears particularly volatile and uncertain, as it does now.And Fed officials, Durham noted, have shifted from well-telegraphed rate hikes to a hazier stance. Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stressed that the central bank is “data dependent,"" meaning it will raise rates again only if the latest economic data supports doing so — or forgo a rate hike if inflation falls steadily.“What they’re really telling us is, ‘We’re all over it like a cheap suit, but we’re not sure what exactly we’re going to do,’ ” Durham said.In addition to higher rates, student loans are expected to take a noticeable bite out of the economy. Roughly 43 million people will resume paying several hundred dollars a month to the government, which Goldman estimates could cut one-half of a percentage point from annual growth in the October-December quarter. More expensive gas could shave an additional 0.3 percentage point from growth in both the fourth quarter and the first three months of next year, Goldman estimates.A government shutdown, should it occur next month, would lop another 0.2 percentage point off growth for each week it endures, according to calculations by Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics.“We think the narrative is going to shift quite materially before the end of the year,” said David Page, head of macro research at AXA IM, a London-based investment manager, who expects the economy to actually shrink in the fourth quarter.Rather than optimism for a “soft landing,” in which inflation is curbed without causing a recession, there will be renewed fears of a downturn, he said.",Yahoo

Eleanor Pringle,Ray Dalio warns Biden’s chip ban is similar to the pre-WW2 oil sanctions the U.S. placed on Imperial Japan—which partly led to Pearl Harbor,"The White House may inadvertently be repeating history by restricting the amount of advanced semiconductors the U.S. exports to China—and if it’s not careful, could repeat the escalations that led to Pearl Harbor. That’s the warning from legendary investor Ray Dalio, who has long advocated for a positive relationship between China and America.Dalio, who founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975, told an audience at the Greenwich Economic Forum that the U.S. finds itself in a “much similar situation” with China, as it did with Japan during World War II.In 1940 the U.S. halted exports to Japan, froze Japanese assets held in U.S. banks, and stopped any negotiations with Japanese diplomats, as tensions between the two sides heightened.Japan, facing down serious shortages and with seemingly no way to negotiate with the U.S., launched an attack on Pearl Harbor in December a year later.And Dalio fears that measures recently announced by the Commerce Department, which will curb shipments of AI chips and chipmaking tools to China as early as October, could heighten tensions in the way a similar move did in the 1940s.“The reason in World War II—war with Japan—you had the cutting off of the oil and then sanctioning them, taking their payments,” Dalio said in a conversation with Bloomberg TV’s David Westin. “So you have a somewhat similar situation. Chips is like oil back then, and it’s a very, very, very delicate issue.”The chip embargo—which U.S. officials say is one to stabilize the relationship between the nations—is one of a series of factors adding fuel to the fire, Dalio added.‘On the brink of red lines’The self-proclaimed sinophile said the two major world powers are inching toward the point of no return on a number of issues.“These irreconcilable differences, they’re right on the brink,” Dalio said.Dalio—whose book Principles: Life and Work was a bestseller in China after it debuted in a translated version—said the “Taiwan issue” was high on this list of tensions.Story continuesTaiwan has been governed independently of China since the 1940s, however officials in Bejing still see the island as part of its territory.For its part, the U.S. has a long-standing “One China” policy, which is the diplomatic acknowledgment of China’s position that there is a single Chinese government.The U.S. Department of State said in a statement last year: “We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side; we do not support Taiwan independence; and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means.”As such, Dalio explained that any diversion from that long-held agreement could prove devastating: “The breaking point is if the United States said, ‘We are in favor of the independence of Taiwan.’ That’s the equivalent of a declaration of war.“And because of our political issues now, internally, you are going to be likely to push that—because of the fact that many in the Congress and so on would say, ‘We’ll defend Taiwan.’”Nobody wants a warThankfully for the global population, Dalio is also convinced that neither the U.S. nor China wants to enter into a conflict.“Neither country wants to go to war,” the man reportedly worth $16.5 billion continued. “Everybody’s afraid of what that war would be like because it would be devastating economically and politically.”High-profile individuals like Janet Yellen are also doing their part to try and solidify the U.S.-China relationship.Following a trip to Beijing this summer, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury admitted that no single visit would “solve our challenges overnight.”However, she added that decoupling from China would be “disastrous for both countries and destabilizing for the world,” and noted that any separation would be “virtually impossible to undertake.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo

Associated Press Finance,Saudi Arabia says it will maintain production cuts that have helped drive oil prices up,"Saudi Arabia on Wednesday confirmed that it will maintain a production cut of 1 million barrels of oil a day through the end of the year.The announcement could further prop up oil prices, which are hovering around $90 a barrel. Production cuts first announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia in July have driven up prices at the pump, enriched Moscow's war chest and complicated global efforts to bring down inflation.The Saudi Energy Ministry reaffirmed that the cuts would continue through the end of the year in a brief statement posted on its website Wednesday attributed to “an official source.” It said the kingdom would continue to produce 9 million barrels per day in November and December.“The source stated that this voluntary cut decision will be reviewed next month to consider deepening the cut or increasing production,” the statement said.Benchmark U.S. crude oil for November delivery rose 41 cents to $89.23 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude for December delivery rose 21 cents to $90.92 a barrel.Saudi Arabia is counting on high oil prices to help fund Vision 2030, an ambitious plan by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to overhaul the economy, reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil and create jobs for young people.",Yahoo
LEAH WILLINGHAM,Child care programs just lost thousands of federal dollars. Families and providers scramble to cope,"WILLIAMSON, W.Va. (AP) — Kaitlyn Adkins is studying law to help families in her community impacted by the opioid epidemic at the heart of West Virginia coal country.But to do that, she needs someone to help look after her three toddlers. The first-generation college graduate said she wouldn’t be able to finish law school without access to reliable daycare.Providers say millions of children and their families are now at risk of losing that vital service. After two years of receiving federal subsidies, 220,000 child care programs across the country were cut off from funding Saturday. The largest investment in child care in U.S. history, the monthly payments ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars, and stabilized the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.“It feels like they're just setting everyone up for failure,” Adkins said, dropping her 2-year-old and 1-year-old twins at daycare on a recent morning before an hour-and-a-half drive to class.For years, providers have been raising alarm about an unsustainable business model that burdens families with high costs and leaves centers with razor-thin profit margins — issues only exacerbated by inflation and a significant workforce shortage.Now, providers say that without additional investment, they face the possibility of shutdown. The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank in Washington, D.C., analyzed a provider survey and government data, and concluded that in five states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia — as well as Washington, D.C., up to half of all providers may be forced to close.Many families and providers are calling on Congress to create a permanent funding solution to the crisis, warning of the ripple effects on the nation's economy. A Democratic proposal failed last month without any Republican support. It would have continued the grants for five years with $16 billion allocated annually.The most at-risk providers are those in rural communities that predominately serve low-income families. In West Virginia, where a quarter of all children live in poverty, the situation is especially dire.Story continuesAdkins brings her children to a center affiliated with a church in Williamson, West Virginia, where nearly 90% of families qualify for federal aid to help cover child care costs. For a family of four, that means making less than $45,000 a year. Williamson is the seat of Mingo County, where one in three residents live below the poverty line, and more than 75% of children in the county school system are being raised by someone other than their parents, often grandparents.Most mornings, Adkins wakes up at 5:30 a.m. to shuttle her kids to Living Water Child Care Center. She typically gets home late, and plays with and bathes her children before studying until early morning.The proud daughter of a former coal miner, Adkins said she's witnessed the loss of coal jobs and the influx of opioids in the state with the highest rate of overdoses. She said taxpayers will end up paying more in the long run to welfare programs if the government doesn't make investments now in child care.""We’re seeing our kids really suffer — and that’s a big problem,” said Adkins, who wants to practice law focused on child abuse and neglect. “If they have no structure and no guidance, we’re going to keep repeating cycles.”Starting in October 2021, Democrats' American Rescue Plan Act disbursed $24 billion in payments to providers across the country, with varied funding based on program size and quality rating. In West Virginia, centers received an average $5,000 to $27,000 a month and family providers got between $750 to $3,200. The legislation also included $15 billion to expand the block grant program that subsidizes the cost of child care for low-income families, though it is set to expire in September 2024.At Living Water, a $7,000 monthly subsidy went to purchasing new curriculum and advancing employee certifications, according to Director Jackie Branch. The investment paid off: In April, the center moved up a tier in its state quality rating, increasing its monthly stabilization funding to $11,000.When staffers realized many children didn't get outside playtime at home, they installed a rubber playground and colorful sunshades.School-aged kids can finally work on homework assignments in the after-school program thanks to recently purchased computers.Like most providers in the state, Living Water was also able to offer staff bonuses.As of May 2022, the median pay for a child care worker in the U.S. was $13.71, compared with $10.47 in West Virginia, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. Wage growth in the industry has fallen behind other low-wage professions.Over the years, Goldie Huff, a waitress at a steakhouse in Williamson, has cared for more than two dozen foster care children. There are just two child care centers in the entire county, and the community can't afford to lose either one, she said.“It would be horrible,” she said, if Living Waters closed. All of her foster children have attended Living Water, along with kids, grandchildren and other family members. The state has the highest number of youth in foster care in the country.She said a lot of the kids she cares for are recovering from traumatic childhood experiences and need structure. “How many kids do you know that don’t wake up to breakfast? They don’t know where the meals are coming from. They’ve not had baths. They’ve never had nice clothes.""The center serves three meals a day, plus snacks. They also distribute donations such as clothes and school supplies.Branch said it will be an uphill battle to find other grants to make up for lost funds.Policymakers should not only be worried about shuttering centers, but also about the quality of care and education available with such limited resources, said Melissa Colagrosso, CEO of A Place To Grow Children’s Center, in Fayetteville, West Virginia. Since they opened 28 years ago, the number of accredited centers in the state has been halved.“Right in the beginning, that’s our opportunity to really change the brain and change a child’s future,"" she said. “You invest in early childhood, then you invest less in prisons.”West Virginia’s Department of Health and Human Resources announced last week it was sending providers a final bonus payment as September drew to a close, but that funds were tapped. The agency also allocated $24 million in TANF funds to reimburse providers for children whose costs are subsidized based on enrollment rather than attendance for another year.But providers say what they need instead is a permanent, long-term funding solution.If West Virginia wants to grow its economy, child care is part the infrastructure necessary for that to happen, Tiffany Gale said. She isn't a parent herself, but just months before the pandemic started, she began caring for six children at her home in West Virginia's northern panhandle.In just three years, she’s moved up a level in the state’s quality rating status and expanded into an empty commercial space downtown. She has five staff members and 18 children — 24 split between the two sites — who would have otherwise been waitlisted. Three-quarters of them are considered low-income, and qualify for government-subsidized care.With the help of federal subsidies, Gale was able to purchase the two units next door. But now that the pandemic-era support is ending, Gale doesn’t know if she'll be able to stay in business.Policymakers have relied on the passion of child care providers — who are mostly women — to find a way to make ends meet without the resources and support they really need, Gale said.“They’re still going to do it, whether they’re living in poverty and having to go to the food bank every week or not,” she said, of child care workers' commitment to work. ""I think we really take advantage of that instead of lifting them up, lifting children up and lifting our communities up.”",Yahoo
REBECCA SANTANA,That blaring noise you heard? It was a test of the federal government's emergency alert system,"WASHINGTON (AP) — “THIS IS A TEST"": If you have a cellphone or were watching television Wednesday, you should have seen that message flash across your screen as the federal government tested its emergency alert system used to tell people about emergencies.The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System sends out messages via the Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alerts.The Emergency Alert System is a national public warning system that's designed to allow the president to speak to the American people within 10 minutes during a national emergency via specific outlets such as radio and television. And Wireless Emergency Alerts are short messages — 360 characters or less — that go to mobile phones to alert their owner to important information.While these types of alerts are frequently used in targeted areas to alert people in the area to things like tornadoes, Wednesday's test was done across the country.Antwane Johnson, the director of FEMA's Integrated Public Alert and Warning System which conducted the test, said afterward that he's confident the test performed as expected but that the government would gather and analyze data in the coming weeks to assess how it went. He estimated hundreds of millions of people received Wednesday's message.Johnson said he'd already received reports from across the country of people who'd received the alerts including from colleagues at a conference for emergency managers in Tennessee. From where he observed the test, Johnson said he saw the entire map “light up.”“I am totally elated,” he said.The test was slated to start at at 2:20 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, although some phones started blaring just a few minutes before that. Wireless phone customers in the United States whose phones were on got a message saying: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” The incoming message also made a loud noise.Story continuesCustomers whose phones were set to the Spanish language should have gotten the message in Spanish.The test is conducted over a 30-minute window, although mobile phone owners should only get the message once. If their phones were turned off at 2:20 p.m. and then turned on in the next 30 minutes, they should have gotten the message when they turned their phones back on. If they turn their phones on after the 30 minutes have expired they should not get the message.The message also went to people watching broadcast or cable television or listening to the radio. That messages said: “This is a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, covering the United States from 14:20 to 14:50 hours ET. This is only a test. No action is required by the public.""Federal law requires the systems be tested at least once every three years. The last nationwide test was Aug. 11, 2021.The test has spurred falsehoods on social media that it's part of a plot to send a signal to cellphones nationwide to activate nanoparticles such as graphene oxide that have been introduced into people’s bodies. Experts and FEMA officials have dismissed those claims, but some social media users said they planned to shut off their cellphones Wednesday.FEMA spokesman Jeremy Edwards said after the test was done that people have every right to turn their phones off to avoid the test but the organization hopes that after the test is done they make sure they turn their alerts back on because it's designed to make sure people can be reached in an emergency.People on social media also suggested turning off phones for other reasons, such as not disturbing students and teachers in classrooms or children during naptimes at day care. At the White House, messages taped to chairs in the press briefing room asked members of the media to turn off their cellphones during the daily briefing.Not everyone did.Shortly before 2:20 p.m., journalists’ and staff’s phones began buzzing in the briefing room.“Oh! There we go,” said press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. After joking that the briefing was over, she added: “It works. Every couple of years, folks.”Alarms continued to sporadically go off for a few minutes afterward.Secretary of State Antony Blinken was speaking at an event at the University of Texas at Austin when cell phones in the audience went off, briefly disrupting the conversation. At the time the conversation was focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine.“It might be our Russian friends interrupting us,” Blinken joked. “But I’m glad to know the national alert system works.”The test also sparked discussion about how it could affect people in abusive situations. Some people in abusive situations have secret cellphones — usually with notifications muted — hidden from their abuser that allow them to keep contact with the outside world. Organizations that work with abuse survivors recommended they turn off their phones entirely during the 30-minute-long test Wednesday so as to not have the blaring noise give away to their abuser the fact that they have a secret phone.___Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.",Yahoo
Eleanor Pringle,Bank of America warned consumers they would be pushed to the ‘point of pain’—and CEO Brian Moynihan says we’ve now reached that point,"It’s a message now echoing in every corner of Wall Street: Consumers have finally run out of steam.It’s also an eventuality Bank of America has predicted since March, when analysts warned that the Fed would push consumers to the “point of pain” in order to tame inflation.And now, according to Bank of America’s CEO, Brian Moynihan, that time has come.Speaking to CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Moynihan said the way consumers are acting is consistent with a “low growth, low inflation economy,” which the U.S. saw from 2016 to 2019.In a given year, Bank of America customers spend $4 trillion dollars—be it using a debit or credit card, writing a check, confirming a bank transfer, or taking cash out to spend.From 2021 to 2022 that spend grew by 10%, Moynihan said, and began dropping to 9% in the first quarter of 2023.Now that growth figure has dropped to 4.5%, he added, signaling consumers are either too nervous to spend the money they have, or have less in their pandemic-boosted savings accounts to sustain their spending levels.“That is the same of September and October,” Moynihan continued. “That growth rate…is consistent to where we were in ’16, ’17, ’18, ’19, which was a low growth, low inflation economy.”“Consumers’ activity has slowed down…It’s slowed by half, and that means the consumer is being slowed down by the interest rate environment and all the stuff going on.”Lower-income homes are impacted moreMoynihan went on to support an observation made by Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, who said “cracks” are beginning to show in consumer spending, particularly by lower-end consumers.Fraser said that while Citi’s data shows consumer spending is still “good” and is in positive figures, the growth has begun to “come off,” explaining to CNBC that in September numbers, “the softening of the growth in demand, is…evident.”Savings are down for lower-end consumers, Fraser added: “They’re very low at the moment, and I think some of the excess savings from the COVID years are close to depletion.”Story continuesMoynihan said that Bank of America has found similar trends. He said median-income households have lower account balances and are spending down their pandemic war chests.Higher-income households have similarly moved their money out of checking accounts, but have instead moved their fortunes into investments.“You’re seeing that deterioration of positive balances and consumers in those medium-income households down a little bit,” Moynihan said. “That means they’re spending some money in excess of what they bring in. So that means the economy has slowed down, consistent with a low growth, low inflation economy.”Is the Fed’s plan working?If the so-called YOLO (you only live once) spenders have indeed run dry and the economy is inching back, as Moynihan says, to low growth—then has the Fed’s plan really paid off?The first priority of the Fed was to tackle inflation—which has indeed come down. In September 2023, inflation sat at 3.7%, down from 8.3% a year prior.Economists seem largely satisfied by this effort—though many have warned the most difficult part of bringing inflation down lies ahead.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen remarked inflation is being “really well behaved,” while Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel believes rates will hold steady in November.In his weekly Wisdom Tree commentary, professor Siegel observed there is still a great deal of economic uncertainty—not least tensions in the Middle East.Despite this, professor Siegel wrote: “We’re poised for a year-end rally in equities and a good year for 2024.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo

Now you can too with just $25.During a 2019 interview with ThinkAdvisor, Mary Buffett said, ""The first year we were married, I realized, ‘Warren is very rich, therefore, he doesn't want anything.'"" This led her to an unconventional gift choice: She presented her father-in-law with the balance sheet of their music company to show they were profitable.Mary Buffett made it clear that her gift wasn't an investment pitch. She simply wanted to show that they were doing well financially, a subtle but powerful affirmation of Buffett's philosophy of enabling others to make their own way rather than providing them with unearned success. She clarified, ""I just wanted to show him, ‘Look, we're doing good.'""The uniqueness of Mary Buffett's Christmas gift to Warren Buffett becomes even more meaningful when viewed through the lens of Buffett's approach to family and wealth. He's well-known for his belief in giving his children enough resources to take initiative but not so much that they lose the drive to accomplish things on their own. He famously said the perfect inheritance is ""enough money so that they would feel they could do anything but not so much that they would do nothing.""Story continuesTrending: Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.For those curious about what spending Christmas with Buffett entails, his daughter-in-law provided some insight.""When the family got together in Laguna over Christmastime, all the titans of industry would be there,"" she said. The conversation naturally gravitated toward companies and investing, subjects that were always top of mind for Buffett.When asked what Buffett gave as Christmas gifts, she explained that he would typically give each family member $10,000 in hundred-dollar bills every Christmas. Then one year, he gave them $10,000 in shares of Coca-Cola stock with a note explaining they could save it or cash it in. Each year he continued giving them $10,000 of shares in his favorite stocks, which varied.Mary Buffett has since moved on to other ventures, including writing multiple books about her famed former father-in-law and lecturing on business and finance.Buffett didn't amass his fortune by waiting for opportunities to come to him. He actively sought them out and invested wisely. This mindset isn't just for the ultra-wealthy or financial experts; it's a principle that anyone can apply. Whether you’re considering investing in blue-chip stocks or the more uncertain yet potentially rewarding world of startups, taking the initiative is crucial.Buffett's principles of informed decision-making, diversification and taking calculated risks can be applied broadly, even to emerging sectors like healthcare and new technologies. These sectors offer numerous opportunities for anyone to invest in startups, even with as little as $500. Buffett's approach is not so much about having a financial head start, often referred to as a ""silver spoon,"" but more about adopting a disciplined and educated approach to investing.Read Next:As Jack Ma once said, “Opportunities lie in the place where complaints are.” Unearth such opportunities in this promising startup.Power players like Arianna Huffington and Sheryl Sandberg recognize the value in startups.

Dawn Allcot,Biden Unveils Plan To Increase US Homeownership — How It Benefits Low-to-Middle-Income Families Looking To Build Generational Wealth,"Shutterstock / ShutterstockWhile many upper-income individuals in big cities are eschewing homeownership in favor of renting, as recently reported by GOBankingRates, owning a home remains part of the American dream for many low-to-middle-income families.Housing Market 2023: The 10 Most Overpriced Housing Markets in the US — 5 Are in FloridaLearn: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000The Biden Administration is seeking ways to help families make that happen with a number of new initiatives for first-time homebuyers.Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit Offers Down Payment Assistance and MoreThe Biden-Harris Administration recently announced the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, along with down payment assistance for select first-time homebuyers. The program is designed to create a path to homeownership for first-generation or low-wealth buyers whose parents have never owned a home, either.The Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit has not yet been signed by Congress. If it does pass, it will allocate $16 billion in funding to build or rehabilitate 400,000 new homes across the U.S., according to a statement from the White House issued on Monday, Oct. 16. Additionally, the package will provide $10 billion in down payment assistance and $100 million to supplement first-time homebuyers.Policy Changes Could Make It Easier to Qualify for Mortgages at Lower RatesAdditional changes to existing policies could make it easier for some prospective homebuyers to qualify for a loan. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would allow lenders to factor in a positive rental history and on-time student loan payments when they evaluate an applicant’s creditworthiness.That means even someone without a strong history of revolving credit, car loans, or personal loans could qualify for a mortgage at a lower interest rate as long as they show that they have paid their bills, including rent, responsibly in the past.The policy, introduced by HUD through the FHA, also allows homebuyers to use a portion of rental income from Accessory Dwelling Units in the house they are purchasing or building to count as effective income when qualifying for an FHA-insured mortgage, according to the White House release.Story continuesIf someone builds or buys a home with an accessory apartment, or intends to add-on to the house with an additional dwelling, a portion of that unrealized rental income can factor into their mortgage qualifications.“The flexibilities will help more first-time homebuyers, seniors, and inter-generational families leverage ADUs to build generational wealth through homeownership while creating new affordable housing in their communities,” said the White House release.Additional Policy Changes Carve a Path to HomeownershipHUD, through FHA, is also updating the 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program. The policy changes could make it easier for homebuyers and homeowners to finance repair costs prior to a home’s purchase or to refinance their mortgage and tap into their home equity to fund improvements. Under the new policies, they might have more time to complete repairs and improvements prior to purchase.The USDA, simultaneously, is working on launching a pilot program to expand eligibility criteria for Community Land Trust Organizations through the Section 502 Direct Loan Program. Community Land Trusts are non-profit organizations devoted to making homeownership more affordable. Prospective homeowners can lease, rather than purchase, the land, making the overall cost of their home more affordable since they are only purchasing the house. The homeowners must agree to sell the home at a restricted price in order to maintain affordable housing in the community for generations, according to GroundedSolutions.org.Downsizing for Retirement? Stay Away From These 7 HomesBuilding on Past SuccessThese initiatives are designed to build on the past success of the Biden Administration to expand access to homeownership. Data released by the White House shows that first-time homebuying rates are the highest they’ve been since 2000.The FHA has helped 1.8 million homeowners secure mortgages since Biden took office; 1.5 million of those new homeowners (83.6%) were first-time buyers.In the past year, the USDA provided 7,100 direct housing loans, subsidizing homebuyers with interest rates as low as 1%. The average homebuyer that benefited from the program has an income of just $42,918.Bottom LineIf homeownership is one of your dreams or a marker of financial success to you, 2024 might be the year it happens. These programs could help lower- and middle-income Americans begin to build generational wealth through a tangible asset — a family home that is likely to appreciate in value over time while providing a sense of security and stability.More From GOBankingRatesTop 7 Countries with Zero Income TaxHere Are All the States That Don't Tax Social Security Benefits3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement5 Ways to Elevate Your Finances DailyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Biden Unveils Plan To Increase US Homeownership — How It Benefits Low-to-Middle-Income Families Looking To Build Generational Wealth",Yahoo

Ford is the US Navy's newest and largest aircraft carrier — in fact, it's the world's largest.Commissioned in July 2017, it is the first of the Ford-class carriers, which are more technologically advanced than Nimitz-class carriers.It has an improved hull design and weapons stowage, a new weapons elevator, more space on the flight deck, a new electromagnetic-powered aircraft-launch system, three times the electrical-generation capacity of any previous carrier, and a lot more.The USS Gerald R. Ford launched on its first deployment in 2023 to the Mediterranean. The carrier and its strike force are en route toward Israel to provide support after an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas killed 1,400 people.Israel responded with a series of airstrikes on Gaza and most recently issued an evacuation order over the weekend, ordering 1.1 million people out of northern Gaza within a 24-hour deadline. The counter-attack from Israel has killed nearly 3,000 Palestinian people and injured more than 10,000 in Gaza, according to data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.As of October 10, 2023, the USS Gerald R.

Alexandra Canal,Roku stock falls 8% after Wall Street analyst warns of more ad market 'softness',"Roku stock (ROKU) slid 8% on Wednesday after a Wall Street analyst warned softness in the ad market will continue to impact the company's earnings through the end of the year.In a new note released Tuesday night, Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall lowered his price target on shares to $70 from $84, citing concerns the fourth quarter ""could see softness from ad trends.""""We heard at our Advertising Day last month that scatter remains weak quarter-over-quarter, while Roku will also face a reduction in media and entertainment spend due to the ongoing Hollywood strikes,"" Cahall wrote. Scatter refers to ad inventory that isn't purchased during upfront sales.The analyst added that although Roku likely has more upfront inventory in Q4 compared to last year ""it's unclear how upfront pricing compares both year-over-year and to current scatter since this year's TV Upfronts occurred amidst a weak ad environment.""Cahall said he expects softer fourth quarter guidance as a result, anticipating that revenue per streaming hour will fall 8% year over year in Q4 compared to an estimated 4% annual drop in Q3.The analyst also cut his estimates for Q4 platform revenue by 1% to $780 million — 3% below consensus expectations — meaning total revenue would be $929 million, a 7% year-over-year gain but still 3% below Wall Street projections.That lower overall revenue would also hit gross profits with the analyst expecting $379 million in fourth quarter profits, 6% below the Street.Roku stock is down about 17% over the past three months but has soared more than 50% since the start of the year.In Roku's second quarter results, brand advertising remained pressured as total US advertising came in flat year over year. Spending on traditional TV fell 9.4% while traditional TV ad scatter sank 17.2%.At the time, management warned the Hollywood strikes would continue to negatively impact media and entertainment spending through the back half of the year — a notable challenge given the heavy promotions Roku provides for content.Story continuesTo combat some of these hurdles and bring down operating expenses, Roku revealed a slew of cost-cutting measures last month, which included layoffs.The company said it would be eliminating 10% of its workforce, or 300 jobs, in addition to slowing down its pace of hiring. The announcement marked Roku's third round of layoffs in less than a year after it cut 200 jobs in March 2023 and another 200 in November 2022.Excluding charges related to items such as severance and the removal of select content from its streaming platform, Roku said it expects third quarter net revenue in the range of $835 million to $875 million, with adjusted EBITDA in the range of negative $40 million to negative $20 million. This is ahead of its previous Q3 forecast for revenue of roughly $815 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $50 million. A logo for Roku on a remote control in Portland, Ore.

Jeremiah Budin,Viral video shows Tesla owner using controversial method to charge their EV at home: ‘I don’t see a problem’,"One TikTok user recently revealed the method they use to charge their Tesla, setting the comments section ablaze in the process.“You was too cheap to get the Tesla charger installed in your garage so now you gotta pull your car up to the backyard to connect it to the stove outlet just to get 20 miles of charge an hour,” Rickie (@rickologist), a North Carolina-based content creator, wrote.The accompanying video shows the charger coming into the kitchen via a window that is propped open with a towel and plugged into the wall with the regular 120-volt plug adapter that comes with the car. The stove is pulled away from the wall to make room. It does not seem like the ideal charging scenario.The TikTok is tagged #teslamodely and #newcar. A new Tesla Model Y is currently priced at $50,490 before tax credit.Although it seems like there is at least a decent chance that Rickie set this convoluted charging system up just to make a viral post to share with their over 150,000 followers, it is also possible that this is really how they charge their $50,000 EV on a regular basis. Either way, the commenters leaped at the opportunity to roast the whole setup.“How you got money for the Tesla but not the charger?” wrote one commenter.“LMAO. Someone did this at work and it destroyed a bunch of appliances,” wrote another.“Look [online] for certified electricians,” wrote another. “I got my moms installed for $200 since I bought the charger already.”“This is the 2023 version of ‘got a quarter tank of gas, in my new E class,’” wrote another commenter, referencing the 2002 classic “Still Fly” by Big Tymers.Many of the comments were also in support of Rickie’s charging system, however.“Lol it work I don’t see a problem,” wrote one commenter. “We gone find a way.”Join our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",Yahoo
Sabina Wex,'We were living our best lives': This 32-year-old man says he had more financial freedom working at Chili's in 2012 than he does today with a much higher income — here's why,"While it’s not hard to get a millennial to indulge in some nostalgia for the 2010s — the decade many of their cohort entered adulthood and the workforce — what’s got them reminiscing about their younger years lately may come as a surprise.Although many were fresh out of college, still figuring things out and living on minimum wage, they’d likely hesitate to characterize their past selves as “young, dumb and broke.” But not necessarily because they remember themselves as wise and mature.Don't missCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds‘A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency — 3 ways you can prepareAs Mordecai Nuccio explains in a recent TikTok, it all comes down to money. Nuccio feels he had more disposable income back in 2012 compared to now — an assertion that’s been making the rounds on TikTok.“We were making minimum wage, but we were living our best lives,” Nuccio, a 32-year-old photographer, says about his time living on minimum wage working as a food runner at Chili’s.He adds that a big part of his current financial stress is thanks to his increased credit card and student loan debts. Even though he makes more money and lives in a double-income household with his fiancé, he feels more squeezed.Here’s how do you get back to living your best life now that you should have more cash flow.Tackle debtBack in 2012, Nuccio says he had “minimal” credit card debt. But that’s changed as his expenses have increased — and he’s got his student loans to think of too.While expenses tend to increase as you age and take on more responsibilities, making more often translates into spending more. Millennials love splurging on experiences, but that can quickly wander into risky spending habit territory.Story continuesIf you’ve racked up a couple of balances, one way to start picking away at your debt in a manageable way is to use the “debt avalanche method,”.Here’s how it works: you pay off your highest interest loan debt first, and only make minimum payments on all your other debts.Once you’ve paid off the highest interest loan, you move on to the next highest interest debt, and so on — until, voila, all your debt has disappeared.Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howConsolidate your debtUp until recently, student loan payments were suspended. But their return means that borrowers like Nuccio need to figure out how to fit these payments back into their monthly expenses.Unfortunately, 28% of student loan borrowers say they’ll need to take on additional debt to maintain their household payments and repay their student debt, according to a recent Achieve survey.When you’re robbing Paul to pay Peter, things can get messy. But consolidating your debts can make this a little easier. If you have private student loans and credit card debt, you might consider refinancing your loan.Even though it means taking on another loan, if you're able to find an offer at a lower rate than your current accounts, you'll save yourself plenty in interest over the life of the loan. Plus, by pooling your debts, you'll only have to worry about making a single monthly payment, which will hopefully make your life a little easier.Lower your cost of livingNuccio mentions that he lived in Tampa, Florida in 2012 when he worked at Chili’s, but has since moved to New York City to pursue photography. Though this may have been a good move for his career, it’s bad news for his debt.Though Nuccio doesn’t explicitly say which borough he lives in, New York’s Manhattan is the most expensive city in the U.S., according to the Council for Community and Economic Research’s (CCER) most recent data. Though several Florida media outlets report Tampa is the Sunshine State’s most expensive city, it still doesn’t rank on the CCER’s list of priciest cities across the country.So part of your plan to pay back your debt may need to include your locale.

Though financial advisors typically tell investors to allocate 60% of their holdings to stocks and 40% to bonds, there are a lot of factors that make stocks more appealing over the long-term than in past eras, Fink said in an interview with CNBC last week.For one, investors have good opportunities to put their cash into artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as companies that are nearshoring, Fink said.Investors are also likely living longer lives than they did in the past, thanks to new medical advances and drugs like Ozempic, which is seen as a potential cure for obesity, as well as breakthroughs in other areas such as Alzheimer's.A longer lifespan means investors need to be able to support themselves for longer, and should therefore tolerate more risk by investing in stocks for a longer period, versus shifting more to bonds as they get older.""For a long-term investor, with a long-term view, who can tolerate market volatility, you should be at least 80% in equities or hard assets,"" Fink said.Investors who have an especially high tolerance of volatility could even have a 90% or 100% allocation to equities, Fink added, though he noted that many investors couldn't afford big downswings if their portfolio allocations were that high.""You've got to have a 10, 20-year view,"" Fink added.

Susan Elizabeth Turek,First-of-its-kind technology set to revolutionize global shipping: ‘A milestone for the maritime industry’,"The vast majority of international trade takes place via our planet’s waters. Engineering and tech company ABB is helping to chart a new course to reduce the amount of harmful carbon pollution as a result.ABB is collaborating with Dutch shipping company Samskip and India’s Cochin Shipyard, a shipbuilding and maintenance facility, to bring us some of the first ocean container ships that will use a hydrogen fuel cell power distribution system, as CleanTechnica reported.“These ships are a milestone for the maritime industry,” Erik Hofmeester, the head of vessel management at Samskip, said in a press release.ABB’s proprietary onboard grid and tech package helps optimize the usage of hydrogen energy while ensuring safety, reported the Maritime Executive. The companies are beginning with the construction of two vessels that will be able to travel approximately 800 miles.William Grove, a Welsh inventor, is credited with dreaming up the hydrogen fuel cell in 1842, but the technology didn’t begin to see significant applicable development until the 1950s. The first car powered by hydrogen fuel cells wasn’t released by GM until 1966.Hydrogen is a clean energy because it only releases water when utilized. Each of the new Samskip vessels is projected to avoid the creation of roughly 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually — basically the pollution-saving equivalent of removing more than 5,000 passenger cars from the road in a year.That’s great news for the health of our planet and everyone who calls it home.According to NASA, in less than 200 years, the actions of humans have increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by 50%, which has contributed to the overheating of Earth and led to an increased risk of extreme events like wildfires.Thankfully, this effort by ABB, Samskip, and Cochin Shipyard is yet another example of promising tech and cooperation that could make our future a cleaner, safer place while maintaining international trade, as well as human connection.Story continues“ABB is at the forefront of shipping’s most ambitious plans for decarbonization and setting new standards for green maritime transportation,” Juha Koskela, the division president of ABB’s Global Marine and Ports Business, said in the press release. He further noted that operational expenses would also be reduced.The International Maritime Organization, an agency that regulates shipping, is committed to reducing pollution from international shipping by 2050, with a focus on increasing the usage of low-carbon fuels by 2030.There’s no word yet on when the ships will be ready for their first voyage, but according to the Maritime Executive, the order for them was made during the second quarter of 2023.Join our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",Yahoo
Alexandra Canal,Netflix CFO says company has 'long runway of margin growth' as streamer hikes prices,"Netflix (NFLX) said its operating margins have more room to run as the streamer leans on initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing, cheaper ad-supported tier, and newly announced price hikes. ""We don't think we're anywhere near a margin ceiling. We've got a long runway of margin growth,"" Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann said on the company's third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.Operating margin, a key profitability metric, hit 22.4% in the quarter, slightly ahead of Netflix's own projection of 22.2%. The company said it expects full-year operating margin to hit 20% — the high end of its previous forecast of 18% to 20%.The update is an encouraging sign for investors who have been hyper-focused on the company's margin outlook after Neumann doubled down last month on full-year margins falling in the range of 18% to 20%. Consensus estimates are just below 20% for full-year 2023.Neumann added the company's full-year operating margin should improve to roughly 22% to 23% next year, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange.

It was unclear what the exact comparable number was to Wall Street’s expectations, but both figures are higher than the LSEG consensus EPS of $1.24. The earnings are also significantly higher than the 86 cents per share earned in the same quarter a year ago. Total revenue came to $20.9 billion during the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $20.1 billion, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Revenue was 6.5% higher than the $19.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2022. “Our revenue growth from a year ago included both higher net interest income and noninterest income as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we are making in our businesses,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement. “While the economy has continued to be resilient, we are seeing the impact of the slowing economy with loan balances declining and charge-offs continuing to deteriorate modestly,” Scharf added. Net income rose to $5.77 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $3.59 billion a year earlier, driven by an 8% increase in net interest income. Wells Fargo said provision for credit losses in the quarter included a $333 million increase in the allowance for credit losses for commercial real estate office loans and higher credit card loan balances.",CNBC
Bertha Coombs,Pregnant Latinas face greater maternal health concerns,"Zaza Cristina Robles worked as a pregnancy coach in her native Peru, so when she arrived in the U.S. at 16 weeks pregnant, the first thing she did after settling in with her in-laws was to seek medical care. “When they showed us the bill, it was so expensive, my husband and I thought, ‘If this is just for the doctor’s visit, imagine what the delivery will be?’ It scared us,” she said. Lea este artículo en español aquí. Her sister-in-law put her in touch with the Hispanic Health Council, a nonprofit in Hartford, Connecticut. The organization’s Comadrona — or midwife — program helps Latina immigrants and low-income pregnant women navigate the complications of the U.S. health-care system. “They really helped clear up a lot of my fears,” Robles said. The program helped Robles gain health-care coverage as she and her husband seek asylum in the United States. Her comadrona helped her find a doctor who treats low-income patients and connected her with other services. “One of the things that we do here at Hispanic Council is provide birthing classes, in their own language,” said Bianca Noroñas, the Comadrona program manager. Noroñas said coaching and social services have helped the mothers in the nonprofit’s program avoid medical complications during childbirth. “If you don’t receive education and support, that is going to affect you directly in your life,” Noroñas said. In the U.S., the rate of maternal morbidity — medical complications in childbirth — and maternal mortality is nearly twice as high as in other developed nations. “We’ve been paying a lot more attention to try to understand why these differences persist and why our numbers are so high,” said Marie Thoma, a professor at the department of family science at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. “A lot of investment has been going into addressing some of these factors around the health before, during and after pregnancy that we can improve on in the U.S.” U.S. maternal mortality worsened during the pandemic, especially for Latinas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. saw 23.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020, up 18.4% from 2019. For Black women, the maternal mortality rate jumped 25%, while for Hispanic women it surged 44%. While researchers are not clear on why Latinas saw such disproportionately higher mortality rates in 2020, the overall trend in the U.S. has been that women of color have had poorer outcomes in childbirth. Latinas with private insurance plans have a 22% higher rate of severe pregnancy complications than non-Hispanic white women, according to a Blue Cross Blue Shield Association study. Low-income Hispanic women on Medicaid have a 28% higher rate of complications.   Higher rates of obesity and chronic conditions such as diabetes among women of color can play a role in maternal morbidity. Financial barriers to getting proper care also contribute to poorer outcomes for Black and Hispanic women, as well as cultural barriers in health care, said Hispanic Health Council board member Dr. Yvette Martas. “It is the issue of being listened to,” said Martas. She said the health-care system needs to support mothers beyond the delivery room, “creating the culture where this is not a disease model, but it’s a very natural course of how we reproduce.”  An analysis by the Commonwealth Fund calculated that the cost of maternal and child morbidity for U.S. births in 2019 reached $32.3 billion from conception through the child’s fifth birthday. That amounts to an additional $8,624 for each mother-child pair, according to the researchers. Health insurers and large employers such as Walmart have taken note of the problem. This year, Walmart expanded coverage for pregnancy-support programs to workers in four states by providing up to $1,000 for doula services.  Through its pregnancy-support initiative, Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina has seen maternal and infant morbidity rates decline substantially. The insurer’s Centering Pregnancy program has cut the rate of newborns needing to go into the neonatal intensive care unit from 13.9% to 3.5% — at an average savings of $67,000 on NICU costs. “I think offering doula programs and offering paid leave — there’s a lot of things that I think our companies can do ... that could really support moms during and then just as they return to work,” Thoma said. “It will give back to the company as well.” Beyond pregnancy, the Comadrona program also offers postpartum support. Robles said she got help with diapers and lactation coaching.  “Thank God ... It turned out well for us and they cared for us so well,” said Robles, whose delivery had no complications.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,Ford says it’s ‘at the limit’ of what it can offer UAW as strikes escalate,"In this article DETROIT – Ford Motor is “at the limit” of what it can offer the United Auto Workers union in terms of economic concessions, an executive said Thursday as contract negotiations continue for roughly 57,000 U.S. workers. Kumar Galhotra, president of the company’s traditional operations, said that while the company is willing to shuffle money around within the existing offer to meet the union’s priorities, any added costs would hurt the automaker’s ability to operate in the future and invest in emerging areas such as electric vehicles. “We’ve been very clear that we are at the limit. We stretched to get to this point,” Galhotra said Thursday during a media and analyst call. “Going further will hurt our ability to invest in the business like we need to invest.” Galhotra declined to disclose how much the company’s current offer to the union would cost the company. His comments come a day after the union unexpectedly launched a strike at the automaker’s highly profitable SUV and pickup truck plant in Kentucky. “We’re surprised by the escalation last night,” Galhotra said. “Kentucky Truck Plant is one of the most important manufacturing plants of any kind in America.” UAW President Shawn Fain said Wednesday night that the strike escalation was a result of the company repeating its previous offer instead of offering additional economic benefits. “This offer was the exact same offer they gave us two weeks ago. In our position, they’re not taking it seriously,” Fain said during a pre-recorded online video. “We’ve been very patient working with a company on this. At the end of the day, they have not met expectations. They’re not even coming to the table on it.” Ford’s most recent proposal included 23%-26% wage increases depending on classification; retention of platinum health care benefits; ratification bonuses; reinstatement of cost-of-living; and other benefits. In the past several days, Ford said, it had been negotiating outstanding issues such as retiree benefits and potential options for future battery plant workers, in line with guidance from the union. Electric vehicle battery plants have been a major point of contention for the union in bargaining with all three of the Detroit automakers. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have all formed joint ventures with battery makers to manufacture EV batteries in the United States. Officially, because they’re owned by joint ventures, the battery plants aren’t and won’t be covered by the automakers’ agreements with the union. The union has characterized the joint-venture arrangements as a plan to shut it out of the new factories, many of which are under construction now. But the UAW said last Friday that GM had agreed to place the workers at those battery plants under its national agreement with the union – a strong hint that it now expects Ford and Stellantis to do the same.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,A $150 million opening for The Eras Tour concert film? Don’t doubt Taylor Swift,"In this article The weekend box office (Taylor’s Version). Taylor Swift has sold out stadiums worldwide and now she’s packing cinemas, with her sights set on a $100 million opening weekend for her The Eras Tour concert film — and that’s on the conservative side. Box office analysts predict Swift’s film could generate as much as $150 million during its debut this weekend, a figure that would make it the highest opening of a concert film ever, and also one of the highest openings of 2023. “Taylor is in a league of her own with this release,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. Fervor for the tickets has picked up because a significant portion of Swift’s fanbase was unable to attend the concert in person due to high demand and secondary market price surges. The film is expected to draw those who were unable to attend, as well as spark repeat viewings. “Given the unique nature of virtually every aspect of the marketing and theatrical release strategy of the Taylor Swift Eras Tour film, speculation is running rampant as to how massive the opening weekend will be,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst a Comscore. Demand was so high, in fact, that Swift shifted the release date from Friday to Thursday, offering showtimes beginning at 6 p.m. local time. “Look what you genuinely made me do,” Swift wrote on Instagram on Wednesday as she announced the early access showings in the U.S. and Canada. “We’re also adding additional showtimes Friday and throughout the weekend. All tickets will be available by 10am tomorrow morning. And it’ll be showing starting Friday in 90 countries all over the world.” Source: Comscore Presales for the theatrical concert have generated interest on par with the likes of Disney’s Marvel and Star Wars franchises. Average ticket prices for the film are more than 40% higher than typical releases this year. Base prices for tickets for standard formats start at $19.89 for adults and $13.13 for kids. The numbers reflect Swift’s birth year and her lucky number, 13. Tickets for premium format screens such as IMAX and Dolby come at a higher cost. “Taylor is opening her movie like a traditional Hollywood tentpole in close to 4,000 theaters domestically,” Robbins said. “Whether or not Swift’s blockbuster has staying power will be up to her fans and whether or not casual audiences decide to check out the hype.” Comscore reports the film will open in 3,850 locations, the most of any concert film ever. Source: Comscore AMC Entertainment , which is distributing the film, reported last week that presales for its theaters had already exceeded $100 million for the full run of Swift’s film. Robbins warned that because the film is only showing on the weekends, instead of full-week play like traditional movies, it could skew box office comparisons after opening weekend. Still, expectations are high that Swift’s theatrical concert will generate revenue throughout its limited engagement. It runs through Nov. 5. Still, movie theaters are likely to see a big bump in concession sales as cinemas have designed specialty popcorn buckets and boutique cocktails for the film. Additionally, many locations have plans to set up friendship bracelet-making tables and other in-person events to make the occasion bigger and more memorable than just a trip to the movies. “No matter what, [the film is] already an enormous success and music to the ears of theater owners,” said Robbins.",CNBC
Hugh Son,"Bank earnings kick off amid concerns about rising rates, bad loans","In this article American banks are closing out another quarter in which interest rates surged, reviving concerns about shrinking margins and rising loan losses — though some analysts see a silver lining to the industry’s woes. Just as they did during the March regional banking crisis, higher rates are expected to lead to a jump in losses on banks’ bond portfolios and contribute to funding pressures as institutions are forced to pay higher rates for deposits. KBW analysts Christopher McGratty and David Konrad estimate banks’ per-share earnings fell 18% in the third quarter as lending margins compressed and loan demand sank on higher borrowing costs. “The fundamental outlook is hard near term; revenues are declining, margins are declining, growth is slowing,” McGratty said in a phone interview. Earnings season kicks off Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo . Bank stocks have been intertwined closely with the path of borrowing costs this year. The S&P 500 Banks index sank 9.3% in September on concerns sparked by a surprising surge in longer-term interest rates, especially the 10-year yield, which jumped 74 basis points in the quarter. Rising yields mean the bonds owned by banks fall in value, creating unrealized losses that pressure capital levels. The dynamic caught midsized institutions including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic off guard earlier this year, which — combined with deposit runs — led to government seizure of those banks. Big banks have largely dodged concerns tied to underwater bonds, with the notable exception of Bank of America . The bank piled into low-yielding securities during the pandemic and had more than $100 billion in paper losses on bonds at midyear. The issue constrains the bank’s interest revenue and has made the lender the worst stock performer this year among the top six U.S. institutions. Expectations on the impact of higher rates on banks’ balance sheets varied. Morgan Stanley analysts led by Betsy Graseck said in an October 2 note that the “estimated impact from the bond rout in 3Q is more than double” losses in the second quarter. Bond losses will have the deepest impact on regional lenders including Comerica , Fifth Third Bank and KeyBank , the Morgan Stanley analysts said. Still, others including KBW and UBS analysts said that other factors could soften the capital hit from higher rates for most of the industry. “A lot will depend on the duration of their books,” Konrad said in an interview, referring to whether banks owned shorter or longer-term bonds. “I think the bond marks will look similar to last quarter, which is still a capital headwind, but that there’ll be a smaller group of banks that are hit more because of what they own.” There’s also concern that higher interest rates will result in ballooning losses in commercial real estate and industrial loans. “We expect loan loss provisions to increase materially compared to the third quarter of 2022 as we expect banks to build up loan loss reserves,” RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy wrote in a Oct. 2 note. Still, bank stocks are primed for a short squeeze during earnings season because hedge funds placed bets on a return of the chaos from March, when regional banks saw an exodus of deposits, UBS analyst Erika Najarian wrote in an Oct. 9 note. “The combination of short interest above March 2023 levels and a short thesis from macro investors that higher rates will drive another liquidity crisis makes us think the sector is set up for a potentially volatile short squeeze,” Najarian wrote. Banks will probably show stability in deposit levels in the quarter, according to Goldman Sachs analysts led by Richard Ramsden. That, and guidance on net interest income in the fourth quarter and beyond, could support some banks, said the analysts, who are bullish on JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Perhaps because bank stocks have been so beaten down and expectations are low, the industry is due for a relief rally, said McGratty. “People are looking ahead to, where is the trough in revenue?” McGratty said. “If you think about the last nine months, the first quarter was really hard. The second quarter was challenging, but not as bad, and the third will be still tough, but again, not getting worse.”",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,Dollar General stock jumps after it brings back former CEO,"In this article Dollar General’s former CEO Todd Vasos is coming out of retirement to helm the company, which aims to rebound from slowing growth and allegations of unsafe working conditions. Vasos, who served as the discounter’s CEO between June 2015 to November 2022, will replace Jeff Owen effective immediately, the company announced on Thursday. “The Board has tremendous respect for Jeff and greatly appreciates his many contributions to the Company, especially during his long tenure leading our retail operations,” said Michael Calbert, the chairman of the company’s board, in a statement. “However, at this time, the Board has determined that a change in leadership is necessary to restore stability and confidence in the Company moving forward.” Owen had been in the role for less than a year. During that time, Dollar General has seen a slowdown in its sales growth and has faced criticism from federal officials and activists for having unsafe stores that put employees at risk. The company, which is rapidly adding stores and exanding its footprint, has more than 19,000 locations in 47 states. Dollar General has more than 185,000 full- and part-time employees. Dollar General shares jumped more than 6% in extended trading Thursday. When it last reported earnings, Dollar General cut its full-year profit guidance. It did so again Thursday, and said it was now expecting earnings per share of about $7.10 to $7.60, compared to its previous expectation of $7.10 to $8.30. Dollar General also said it anticipates net sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, revised from a previous expectation of 1.3% to 3.3%. The company said it expects same-store sales to be in a range of flat to down 1% this year, versus a prior expectation of a 1% decline to a 1% increase. Vasos said in a statement he is “honored” to rejoin the company at such a “pivotal time.” “I look forward to getting back to work with the broader team as we strive to return to a position of operational excellence for our employees and customers and deliver sustainable long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders,” said Vasos. Slowing sales have come amid pressure from employees and activists over working conditions. In May, shareholders passed a resolution, over the objections of the company’s board, to start an independent audit into worker safety. But it was unclear if the measure was binding and whether the company would carry it out. Dollar General has accumulated more than $21 million in fines from federal officials for issues including blocked fire exits, blocked electrical outlets and clutter. At the time the shareholder resolution passed, a Dollar General spokesperson said the company aims “to create a work environment where employees are able to grow their careers, serve their local communities and feel valued and heard, and we encourage employees to share their feedback through the many company-provided channels so that we can listen and work together to address concerns and challenges, as well as to celebrate successes.”",CNBC
Leslie Josephs,"Delta says Hollywood, auto strikes are denting business travel","In this article Recent strikes by Hollywood talent and United Auto Workers union members are a “drag” on business travel demand, which is otherwise recovering, Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said Thursday. Delta has an outsized exposure to the automotive and entertainment industries, with a more than 70% market share at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and a nearly 20% share at Los Angeles International Airport, more than any other carrier, according to airport data. The strikes have had “a not insignificant change in the business travel to and from Los Angeles as well as now the UAW strike, which curtailed a significant amount of the business in Detroit,” Hauenstein said on an earnings call Thursday. “We are probably the most impacted by those two sectors.” The United Auto Workers’ targeted strikes, which began after major Detroit automakers and the union failed to reach labor deals before a September contract expiration, are entering their fourth week — and escalating. Hollywood writers earlier this week ratified a new three-year contract after nearly 150 days of work stoppage that suspended significant film and TV production. But Hollywood actors, represented by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, are still on strike. And late Wednesday, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents production studios like Disney , Universal , Netflix and others, said talks have been been suspended with the two sides far apart on a deal. Delta’s Hauenstein noted that demand from technology and financial services customers posted double-digit growth in the third quarter, contributing to an overall rebound for business travel. A company survey of corporate customers found that a majority expect their travel to stay the same or increase in the last three months of this year and into 2024, Hauenstein said.

Alex Sherman,"Comcast, Disney hire investment banks to value Hulu as sale process makes progress","In this article Comcast and Disney have hired investment banks to value Hulu, the next step in what’s been a nearly five-year process to put the streaming service under one owner. Comcast, which owns one-third of Hulu, has hired Morgan Stanley , and Disney, which owns the other two-thirds, has hired JPMorgan Chase . Each bank is tasked with providing a fair value for Hulu — a condition of an agreement set up in 2019 that allows either Disney or Comcast to trigger an option forcing Disney to buy Comcast’s 33% stake. Spokespeople for Comcast, Disney, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan declined to comment. Nearly five years ago, Comcast and Disney set up an unusual agreement after Disney acquired the majority of Fox’s assets in a $71 billion deal, including Fox’s minority stake in Hulu. That deal gave Disney majority control over Hulu, because Disney already owned one-third of the streaming service. Comcast didn’t want to sell its stake in Hulu to Disney right away because it believed the value of streaming video would increase between 2019 and 2024. Still, Comcast executives also understood the company would no longer have operational control over the future of the company. Consequently, Disney and Comcast worked out a deal where Comcast could participate in the assumed appreciation of the business while also setting a time where Disney could eventually unify ownership and integrate Hulu into its long-term streaming strategy. Initially, the companies set an option strike date of January 2024. Last month, the two companies agreed to move up the deadline at which Hulu will be valued from January 2024 to Sept. 30. That deadline represents the final date at which Hulu’s valuation will be assessed by both Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. On Nov. 1, Comcast can force Disney to acquire its 33% stake in Hulu and/or Disney can trigger its option to acquire the stake from Comcast. That’s expected to happen, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said at the Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia conference last month. “We are excited to get this resolved,” Roberts said at the conference. “The company is way more valuable today than it was [in 2019]. And we are looking forward to seeing how that process [plays out].” Once the option is triggered, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan will begin their assessments of Hulu’s value. If the two banks’ final valuations are within 10% of each other, the average of the two banks’ determinations will be the price at which Hulu is valued. Disney would then pay Comcast 33% of that value for its stake. The 2019 deal set a floor valuation for Hulu at $27.5 billion. If the two banks’ assessments aren’t within a 10% range of each other, then Disney and Comcast would agree to hire a third investment bank to make another valuation conclusion. To set the sale price, that third valuation would then be averaged with the previous assessment that’s closest to it. The valuation calculation process isn’t straightforward. Hulu has 48.3 million subscribers. A pure-play streaming service at its scale has never been sold before. Roberts argued during the Goldman conference that a fair appraisal would also have to include synergy value. Disney’s ownership of Hulu helps prop up Disney+ and ESPN+ subscribers because Disney bundles all three streaming services together. There is no timetable for how long the valuation process will take or when a deal will get done, but Roberts acknowledged Disney and Comcast both want a resolution sooner rather than later, which is why they agreed to move the option strike date forward several months. “It will take a little time for this to play out,” Roberts said. “But both companies wanted to get it behind us. So we pulled the date forward.” Roberts said at the conference Comcast plans to return proceeds from a sale to shareholders.

Drew Richardson,David Beckham says he supports a sale of Manchester United,"In this article Inter Miami co-owner and President David Beckham backs a takeover of his original club Manchester United . “At the moment, there’s no stability,” the longtime former midfielder for the Premier League club told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” in an interview aired Thursday. “It’s the right time for somebody to take over.” Beckham also dispelled reports that he would serve as an ambassador for Manchester United in a potential sale to Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani. Beckham previously served as World Cup ambassador last year in a deal with Qatar. “At the moment there’s been no discussion. I have had a long-standing relationship with Qatar because of my involvement with PSG … but there’s been no discussion at the moment,” Beckham said, referencing the French club Paris Saint-Germain, where he played at the end of his career around the time the Qatar Sports Investments group bought the team. During the CNBC interview, Beckham also discussed his various other ventures, including his ongoing business partnership with Authentic Brands CEO Jamie Salter. Authentic Studios, under Authentic Brands was behind the creation of the newly released Netflix docuseries, “Beckham,” which chronicles Beckham’s rise to superstardom and his marriage to Victoria Beckham. Authentic Brands previously took a majority stake in Beckham’s brand management firm, DB Ventures, in 2022. Beckham’s success at Manchester United is featured prominently in the documentary. The club has had a tumultuous last few years under the leadership of the American Glazer family, who took control of the Premiere League club in 2005. The team went six years without winning a trophy before it won the English League Cup this year. In November last year, Manchester United announced star player Cristiano Ronaldo would leave the team following an interview where he criticized manager Erik ten Hag and the Glazer family. Ronaldo spent only one year with the club during his second stint there. Manchester United is currently ranked 10th in the Premier League and sits at a record of four wins and four losses. Soccer club Inter Miami, of which Beckham is part owner, signed a landmark deal with soccer superstar Lionel Messi earlier this year. Managing owner Jorge Mas said in July that he expects the signing to double revenues of the soccer club over the next year.",CNBC
Melissa Repko,Target CEO meets with Biden as company tries to figure out consumers,"In this article Target CEO Brian Cornell met with President Joe Biden on Thursday afternoon as the retailer — and the White House — try to figure out U.S. consumers. Cornell is one of about a half-dozen business leaders across industries who offered up their point of view on the economy and the labor market at the White House. Other attendees at the meeting with Biden were expected to include Brendan Bechtel, CEO of construction and engineering firm Bechtel Group; Calvin Butler, CEO of energy and utility company Exelon ; Kenneth Chenault, chair and managing director of venture capital firm General Catalyst; Thasunda Brown Duckett, CEO of financial services company TIAA; Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM ; and Judy Marks, CEO of Otis Worldwide, a manufacturer of elevator, escalator and similar equipment, according to the White House. The CEO huddle was closed to the press. In a statement, Target said it appreciated the chance to “participate in this important conversation” but provided few specifics about what was discussed. “While they are incredibly resilient, we know American consumers still face several headwinds that are leaving them with less discretionary income and driving difficult trade-offs in their family budgets,” the statement said. The company said it’s committed to providing affordable prices for shoppers and attractive pay and benefits for employees. In a statement after the meeting, the White House said the president and business leaders spoke about economic growth and “underscored the importance of public sector-enabled, private sector-led investments.” Biden’s meeting with the business leaders comes as the White House gears up for the next presidential election, a time when the president’s track record on the economy and inflation will be under the microscope. Inflation remains stubbornly high — a factor that has cut into consumer spending at Target — but Biden on Thursday cheered new data showing the rate of price increases continues to slow. For Target, the meeting comes at a pivotal time. The retailer’s business has taken a hit from a tougher economic backdrop and the divisive political climate. It recently announced plans to close nine stores in major American cities, including New York City and San Francisco, blaming the shuttered locations on heightened levels of organized retail crime and concerns about violence. The big-box retailer cut its full-year forecast in August, saying its shoppers have continued to watch their dollars and spend mostly on necessities even as inflation cools. At the time, Cornell cited other factors that could hurt sales in the coming months and during the critical holiday season, including higher interest rates and the return of student loan payments. Target also got caught in the crosshairs of conservative political furor over its Pride month merchandise. It has had a collection of LGBTQ-themed items for more than a decade, but the merchandise drew backlash this year. The company removed some items, citing concerns about employee and customer safety. In August, Cornell said on an earnings call that the “negative reaction” contributed to the company missing Wall Street’s sales expectations for the most recent quarter. It’s not the first time the Target CEO has had an important meeting at the White House. During the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, he joined Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and other top executives at a news conference in the Rose Garden with then-President Donald Trump and pledged to help ramp up access to Covid testing. — CNBC’s Emma Kinery contributed to this story",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Hollywood stuck in a rut after talks break down between actors’ union and studios,"Forget about a Hollywood ending for actors and studios — for now. After just under two weeks, negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke down Wednesday night. It appears that wages and artificial intelligence protections remain sticking points between actors and studios. The AMPTP claims that SAG-AFTRA’s offer would cost more than $800 million per year, a sum that studios said would “create an untenable economic burden.” SAG-AFTRA’s negotiating team countered on Thursday, accusing studios of using bully tactics to misrepresent the cost of the actor’s proposal, overstating the price by 60%.The two parties have also clashed on what guardrails should and should not be attached to the use of AI. With the dissolution of talks, the strike will rage on, disrupting marketing campaigns and preventing production from commencing on a significant portion of Hollywood’s film and television projects. While some talk shows, like those of late-night heavyweights Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver, returned following the WGA deal, most scripted programs remain dark. Some independent productions have managed to continue by agreeing to SAG-AFTRA’s interim agreement. If negotiations do not continue or become resolved soon, more theatrical film release dates will be delayed, disrupting the box office, and television releases will be pushed. Hollywood and industry observers had hoped negotiations would move quickly in the wake of the Writers Guild of America’s deal with the AMPTP last month. Writers officially ratified the new contract earlier this week. But Wednesday’s bad turn dashed those hopes. “After meaningful conversations, it is clear that the gap between the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA is too great, and conversations are no longer moving us in a productive direction,” the AMPTP said in a statement Wednesday. Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA’s negotiators claim that the proposal from AMPTP was “shockingly, worth less than they proposed before the strike began.” “These companies refuse to protect performers from being replaced by AI, they refuse to increase your wages to keep up with inflation, and they refuse to share a tiny portion of the immense revenue your work generates for them,” SAG-AFTRA negotiators wrote in a letter to striking actors. The AMPTP said common issues, like general wage increases, SVOD residuals and viewership bonuses, were the same terms ratified by the Directors Guild of America and the WGA. The WGA secured pay increases in each of the next three years, artificial intelligence restrictions and a new residual system for streaming based on viewership. The guild also negotiated higher contribution rates to health benefits and pensions, as well as a guaranteed number of writers in writers’ rooms for television shows. SAG-AFTRA is looking to improve wages, working conditions and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV. The guild is also looking to standardize the self-tape process. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is a member of the AMPTP.",CNBC

The walkouts reflect rising dissatisfaction among pharmacy employees, who have complained for years about having to grapple with understaffing and burdensome work expectations imposed by corporate management. The Covid-19 pandemic worsened those issues, with new duties such as testing and vaccinations stretching employees even thinner.  The growing labor pressure is just one of several challenges Wentworth will have to face when he steps into the chief executive role on Oct. 23. He will also have to grapple with a profit squeeze due to falling demand for Covid products and Walgreens’ rocky transition from being a major drugstore chain to a large health-care company.  Wentworth, during the company’s earnings call Thursday, shared a story about how an employee at a store in Rochester, New York, “professionally and cheerfully” helped deliver a critical medication prescription for his mother.  “It was the kind of experience I appreciate and everyone deserves,” Wentworth said in his first remarks as incoming CEO since Walgreens announced his appointment on Tuesday.  He said committed pharmacists and other team members can collectively “improve the lives of each person who walks through our door in my mom’s hometown Walgreens in Rochester, and in every store we operate.”  The experiences he has had with employees made his decision to join Walgreens “frankly, an easy one,” Wentworth added. His remarks partly echoed a statement the company issued earlier this week in response to the walkouts.  A Walgreens spokesperson touted the company’s pharmacy teams in the statement, noting that they work “tirelessly to serve our communities.” But the spokesperson also acknowledged that the “last few years have required an unprecedented effort from our team members.”  Walgreens is engaged and listening to the concerns of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, the spokesperson said. But it’s unclear whether management has made any changes in response to any of those employees’ demands, which include more staff, payroll transparency, advance notice of staff and schedule changes and mandatory training for new hires, among other items.  In addition to filling and verifying prescriptions, pharmacy employees often have to juggle patient phone calls, administer a growing number of vaccines this fall, work with insurance companies on issues such as copays and reimbursements, perform rapid Covid and flu testing and deal with angry customers who are seeing longer wait times due to understaffing.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,"Viasat won’t replace damaged Americas satellite, moves up financial targets","In this article Viasat shares rose Thursday after the company said it expects to meet financial growth targets earlier than expected and that it won’t need to replace a damaged $750 million communications satellite. While Viasat’s investigation into the root cause of the ViaSat-3 Americas satellite malfunction is still ongoing, the company said its current and imminent satellite fleet, as well as support from third parties, “will meet the current and future needs” of its key mobility market customers despite the lost bandwidth. The company “is well-positioned to achieve its financial growth objectives” despite the problem. Viasat expects to be free cash flow positive in the first half of 2025, earlier than the second half of 2025 it previously forecast. Viasat stock rose 7.5% in trading to close at $16.80 a share. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. The company in July disclosed the malfunction with the recently launched ViaSat-3 Americas satellite, also known as ViaSat-3 F1, that occurred while deploying the reflector of the spacecraft’s antenna. On Thursday, Viasat said it “expects to recover less than 10% of the planned” communications capability of the satellite. The company also expects to finalize a $420 million insurance claim on the ViaSat-3 Americas satellite before the end of the year, representing just over half the company’s value. Separately, Viasat on Thursday confirmed it plans to make a $348 million insurance claim before the end of the year for the I6 F2 backup satellite. The company in August reported that I6 F2′s power system malfunctioned. Together, the pair of Viasat insurance claims total $768 million, which industry executives previously expected would roil the specialty space insurance market.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,AMC CEO identified as victim of an online blackmail attempt last year,"In this article AMC CEO Adam Aron confirmed Thursday he was the victim of a blackmail attempt by a New York woman last year. The case had been previously publicized, identifying the victim in legal documents only as a CEO of a publicly traded company. News outlet Semafor reported Thursday that Aron was the unnamed CEO, which he later confirmed in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Unfortunately, last year I became the victim of an elaborate criminal extortion by a third party who was unknown to me related to false allegations about my personal life,” Aron said. “Rather than give in to blackmail, I personally engaged counsel and other professional advisors and reported the matter to law enforcement,” he said. “I did so knowing I risked personal embarrassment. But with my access to resources, if I did not stand up against blackmail, who could?” The New York woman behind the blackmail attempt, Sakoya Blackwood, pretended to be a former romantic partner of Aron using an anonymous online account beginning in March 2022. She then attempted to extort Aron of $300,000, threatening to expose Aron’s online behavior to the AMC board. Blackwood was charged in a Manhattan federal court for her extortion attempts and was sentenced in July to time already served in jail. Aron said Thursday he was asked by law enforcement to keep the matter confidential during the investigation and legal proceedings, and that he informed AMC’s board after Blackwood’s sentencing. “This indeed was entirely a personal matter, and the matter is closed,” Aron said.",CNBC
Leslie Josephs,Delta Air Lines profit jumps almost 60% after strong summer,"In this article Delta Air Lines’ profit rose nearly 60% in the third quarter as strong travel demand continued through the summer, particularly for international trips, though the carrier forecast full-year earnings toward the low end of an earlier estimate after a jump in fuel prices. In its quarterly report Thursday, Delta said it expects adjusted, full-year earnings of $6 to $6.25 a share, after forecasting $6 to $7 a share in July. Delta cut its free cash flow estimate for the year to $2 billion from the $3 billion it forecast in the summer. Delta said that it expects solid travel demand in the last three months of the year, estimating revenue will rise 9% to 12% from the same quarter of 2022, with per-share earnings of $1.05 to $1.30, in line with estimates. “We expect many of the same trends to continue in the fourth quarter,” CEO Ed Bastian said in a CNBC interview. Delta and other airlines trimmed their third-quarter forecasts in recent weeks because of a surge in fuel prices. “Obviously there’s some short-term pressure on fuel as fuel rose quickly in the third quarter and stayed relatively high into the fourth quarter,” Bastian noted. Here’s how Delta performed in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with Wall Street expectations based on consensus estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Delta brought in adjusted revenue of nearly $14.6 billion for the period, up 13% year over year and in line with analysts’ expectations. Net income for the period was $1.11 billion, or $1.72 per share, up 59% from $695 million, or $1.08 per share, during the same period a year earlier. Adjusted for third-party refinery sales and other items, the company earned $2.03 during the quarter. Delta and other global airlines have cited particularly strong demand for trips abroad, with trans-Atlantic travel a standout. The Atlanta-based carrier reported revenue for those flights was up 34% in the third quarter compared with last year. Delta’s planes flew 88% full in the quarter, up 1 percentage point from the year-earlier period, despite additional capacity both domestically and internationally. Unit revenue from passengers fell 1.5%, year over year. Airfares have dropped in recent months as airlines grew their schedules. In addition to a surge in international trips, the carrier has said it has seen a sharp increase in demand for premium seats, like business class or premium economy. Main cabin revenue came in at $6.62 billion, up 12% on the year, while premium product sales rose 17% to $5.11 billion, Delta said. “I know the lower-fare airlines are having some challenges but our premium product, especially domestically is doing very, very well,” Bastian said in the interview. He added that business travel is more than 80% recovered to 2019 levels. However, Delta President Glen Hauenstein said Thursday on an earnings call that the Hollywood and autoworkers strikes have hurt demand from those sectors. Delta has a more than 70% market share in Detroit and nearly 20% at Los Angeles International Airport, the most of any carrier. Delta came under fire from customers last month when it announced it would make it harder to earn elite frequent flyer status and said it will scale back access to its popular airport lounges after travelers experienced long entry lines. Weeks later, Bastian said the carrier would make changes to those new policies, which he said might have gone “too far.” Bastian declined to provide details but said changes could be announced in the “coming days.” “Customers almost universally understand we had to do something given the significant demand for our premium assets,” he said. United Airlines and American Airlines are scheduled to report third-quarter results next week.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,UAW launches strike against Ford’s Kentucky truck plant as dispute escalates,"In this article DETROIT — The United Auto Workers union launched an unexpected strike against Ford Motor at the automaker’s highly profitable SUV and pickup truck plant in Kentucky. The strike was effective at 6:30 p.m. ET Wednesday at Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant, where the automaker produces Ford Super Duty pickups as well as the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator SUVs. The facility employs 8,700 UAW members. The strike at the plant — Ford’s largest in terms of employment and revenue — marks a major escalation in the UAW’s targeted, or “stand-up,” strikes. It also represents a shift in strategy now in the fourth week of expanded strikes. For previous work strikes, UAW President Shawn Fain has publicly announced the targets before the work stoppages occur. A Ford source said the union informed the company early Wednesday afternoon that it wanted a new economic counteroffer by 5 p.m. ET, followed by a meeting request for 5:30 p.m. ET with the UAW’s entire Ford bargaining committee, including Fain and union Vice President Chuck Browning. The source, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private, said the meeting lasted less than 10 minutes before Fain declared that the company had “lost Kentucky Truck.” “The strike was called after Ford refused to make further movement in bargaining,” the union said in a release. “The surprise move marks a new phase in the UAW’s Stand Up Strike.” A UAW source with knowledge of the talks said Ford did not add any additional cash to its proposed deal, which provoked the strike escalation. The source added the union was expecting Ford to enhance its prior economic offer. Ford said the “decision by the UAW to call a strike at Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant is grossly irresponsible but unsurprising given the union leadership’s stated strategy of keeping the Detroit 3 wounded for months through ‘reputational damage’ and ‘industrial chaos.’”  The latter part of the statement refers to leaked private messages last month in which UAW communications director Jonah Furman discussed the union’s public posturing of issues and targeted strikes as causing “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” to the automakers. The companies have argued the messages, as well as the union’s actions, show UAW negotiators were never actually interested in reaching a deal with the Detroit automakers. “We have been crystal clear, and we have waited long enough, but Ford has not gotten the message,” Fain said in a statement Wednesday. “It’s time for a fair contract at Ford and the rest of the Big Three. If they can’t understand that after four weeks, the 8,700 workers shutting down this extremely profitable plant will help them understand it.” Ford said the new strike puts at risk approximately a dozen additional operations at the automaker and “many more supplier operations that together employ well over 100,000 people.” Ford said it had presented an “outstanding offer” and “has been bargaining in good faith this week on joint venture battery plants,” which have been a recent focus of the talks. General Motors last week agreed to include workers at its electric vehicle battery plant in the company’s national contract with the union, which Fain called a “transformative win.” Fain said the union expects Chrysler parent Stellantis and Ford to follow suit, including battery plant workers in eventual contract agreements. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The additional workers brings UAW’s total to about 34,000 U.S. workers, or roughly 23% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, who are currently on strike. Fain will give bargaining updates and potentially announce further strikes at 10 a.m. Friday online, the union said Wednesday night.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Walgreens stock rises as cost cuts make progress, even as profit outlook comes up short","In this article Walgreens on Thursday offered soft profit guidance and reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations, as demand for Covid vaccines and tests sinks in the U.S.  The retail pharmacy giant – squeezed by the transition out of the Covid pandemic, a leadership shake-up, its wobbly push into health-care and recent labor pressure from pharmacy staff – has now underperformed Wall Street’s adjusted earnings expectations for two straight quarters. The last time Walgreens posted a consecutive earnings miss was nearly a decade ago. Still, Walgreens reported narrower losses and progress in its cost-cutting plans. It also posted sales growth in its health care business, which is now central to the company’s business strategy. Shares of Walgreens closed 7% higher on Thursday. The stock had been down more than 39% for the year heading into the open.  The quarterly results came two days after Walgreens named health-care industry veteran Tim Wentworth as its new CEO following the abrupt departure of the company’s former top executive, Roz Brewer, last month. Wentworth, who will take over on Oct. 23, is tasked with steering the retail pharmacy giant out of a rough spot.  “I have worked with Walgreens as a customer partner, competitor investor and family member, and I understand the challenges ahead for us,” Wentworth, the former CEO of Cigna ’s pharmacy benefits management company, said during the earnings call Thursday. Wentworth also praised the company’s pharmacy staff, sharing a brief story about how an employee at a New York location helped fill his mother’s prescription for critical medications. However, he made no mention of the three-day walkouts that pharmacists and pharmacy technicians held this week to protest chronic understaffing and other poor working conditions. The company said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.20 to $3.50 in the coming fiscal year, which is lower than analysts’ estimate of $3.72. Walgreens expects lower Covid-related sales, along with a higher tax rate and lower sale and leaseback contributions, to offset earnings growth.  Walgreens also sees revenue for the year at $141 billion to $145 billion. Wall Street analysts estimated sales of more than $144 billion. “We see a continuation of the challenging trends that impacted us in 2023,” interim CFO Manmohan Mahajan said during an earnings call Thursday, noting that the company is “adopting a prudent approach.” Mahajan added that Walgreens expects to see a higher level of shrink, or lost inventory, in the upcoming fiscal year, which has been increasing for the company over the last several months and continues to represent a serious systemic issue across the retail industry. But Interim CEO Ginger Graham noted during the call that the company expects over $1 billion in savings during the next fiscal year due to its ongoing cost-cutting initiative, which involves closing unprofitable stores and using AI to drive supply chain efficiencies, among other efforts. Here’s what Walgreens reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: The company reported a net loss of $180 million, or 21 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That compares with a net loss of $415 million, or 48 cents per share, during the same period a year ago. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per share were 67 cents for the quarter.  Mahajan said the loss was driven by charges for certain legal and regulatory approvals and settlements, and one-time charges related to Walgreens’ cost-cutting program. Walgreens booked sales of $35.42 billion in the quarter, which is up roughly 9% from the same period a year ago due to growth in its U.S. retail pharmacy and international business segments.  Sales in the company’s U.S. health-care division also grew. Walgreens noted in a release that it is “intently focused on accelerating” that segment’s profitability moving forward.  Walgreens has made significant investments to transform from a major drugstore chain to a large health-care company. But the pharmacy chain is facing a number of challenges in that transition, including a profit squeeze due to softer consumer spending and declining demand for Covid products as patients emerge from the pandemic. Walgreens is also facing an open revolt among pharmacists and pharmacy technicians demanding better working conditions. Walgreens’ U.S. retail pharmacy segment generated $27.66 billion in sales in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 3.7% from the same period last year. Comparable sales at individual locations rose 5.7%.  Pharmacy sales for the quarter increased 6.4% compared with the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, with comparable sales up more than 9% due to price inflation in brand medications and mix impacts. Total prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, decreased by 0.5% to 297 million. Walgreens cited a weaker respiratory virus season this fall, which is blunting demand for medications and vaccines.  The company administered roughly 400,000 Covid vaccines in the quarter, down from 2.9 million during the same period last year, according to Mahajan. Retail sales for the quarter decreased 4.3% compared with the same period a year ago, and comparable retail sales fell 3.3%.  Mahajan said retail revenue was impacted by a decline in demand for over-the-counter Covid tests, weaker cough, cold and flu sales and softer consumer spending. He added that elevated shrink negatively affected sales for health and wellness and personal care and beauty products. Meanwhile, the company’s international segment racked up $5.78 billion in sales in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is up more than 12% from the same period a year ago.  Mahajan said that reflects growth across all international markets, with sales from the company’s U.K. subsidiary, Boots, growing nearly 11%. Sales in Walgreens’ U.S. health-care segment came in at $1.97 billion, up from $622 million for the same period last year. Its operating loss narrowed to $294 million from $338 million. Primary-care provider VillageMD, which includes urgent-care provider Summit Health, saw revenue grow by 17%. Walgreens said that reflects “existing clinic growth and clinic footprint expansion” of VillageMD, which has a network of hundreds of full-service doctors offices across the U.S.  Sales at CareCentrix, which coordinates home care for patients after they’re discharged from the hospital, increased 24% due to additional service offerings and expansion into additional markets.  The health-care segment took a loss of $30 million in the quarter before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared to a loss of $133 million during the same period a year ago. Walgreens said that “improvement” was driven by growth at CareCentrix and Shields Health Solutions, a specialty pharmacy company included in the health care segment.  But John Driscoll, president of the U.S. health-care business, said that the company is “not satisfied with the near-term return on our investments” in the segment. “We will continue to grow in 2024 but with a renewed focus on more profitable growth,” he said during the earnings call. – CNBC’s Robert Hum contributed to this article.

Amelia Lucas,Chipotle plans ‘modest’ menu price increases after pausing hikes this year,"In this article Chipotle Mexican Grill is planning to raise prices again. “For the first time in over a year, we will be taking a modest price increase to offset inflation,” Chipotle Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Laurie Schalow said in a statement to CNBC. The company did not share how much menu prices will rise as a result of the decision. After peaking last June, inflation has cooled. Prices for many goods and services are still rising but at a slower rate. The 12-month consumer price index rose 3.7% in August after climbing 8.3% a year earlier, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The burrito chain started hiking its menu prices in June 2021, citing the cost of rising wages for its employees. It raised its prices again during the first three months of 2022 and then again in July of that year. But Chipotle paused its price hikes as some customers pulled back on restaurant spending and ingredient costs stabilized. In April, CEO Brian Niccol said the chain had demonstrated its pricing power but would hold off on raising prices any more. At that time, its prices were up roughly 10% compared to the year-ago period. Three months later, Niccol said Chipotle would reconsider its pricing as the company’s fourth quarter drew closer. Chipotle’s stock has risen 30% this year, giving it a market value of $50.1 billion. The company is expected to report its third-quarter earnings Oct. 26. Insider first reported that Chipotle’s prices are going up again.",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,Birkenstock slides 12% in stock market debut after opening at $41 a share,"In this article Shares of Birkenstock slid more than 12% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The German shoe brand’s stock closed at $40.20 per share, down from its opening trade of $41 per share, giving it a market value of $7.55 billion. The stock’s opening price came in lower than its initial price of $46 set Tuesday, which was just shy of the midpoint of its expected range of $44 to $49 per share. Birkenstock sold 10.75 million ordinary shares in the offering, raising about $495 million and initially valuing the company at about $8.64 billion. Birkenstock had originally sought a valuation of up to $9.2 billion. The company’s market debut comes nearly 250 years after it was founded by German cobbler Johann Adam Birkenstock. It remained under family control until 2021 when private equity powerhouse L Catterton acquired a majority stake in a deal that valued the business at $4.85 billion.  In an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” Birkenstock CEO Oliver Reichert explained why the company decided to go public. “The best thing for the brand would be staying family owned, but within the family there were so many problems, so we go for the second best option and that’s to be public and give the brand back to the people,” said Reichert. Since L Catterton acquired its stake, sales have grown and Birkenstock’s valuation has nearly doubled. Between fiscal 2020 and 2022, sales jumped from 728 million euros ($771 million) to 1.24 billion euros. Over that time, the company grew direct-to-consumer sales, strategically exited certain wholesale partnerships and focused on driving sales of items with higher price points. It posted net income of about 187 million euros in fiscal 2022 and saw margins of about 60%. Birkenstock has room to grow those margins if it expands its direct-to-consumer sales, which have grown from 18% of sales in fiscal 2018 to 38% in fiscal 2022, it said in a securities filing. The offering comes as the IPO market gradually begins to defrost after more than a year of stagnation. But it has remained choppy and uncertain. Multiple recent IPO filers did well in their first couple of days of trading, but those stocks have since fallen. Instacart priced its long-awaited IPO at $30 per share last month. But after an initial 40% pop, it closed at $33.70 on its first day on the Nasdaq and is now trading below its opening share price. Oddity Tech , another L Catterton-backed consumer company, debuted on the public markets in July with a 35% pop and saw its stock close at $47.53 after the first day of trading. Soon after, it reached a high of $56 per share but since then, Oddity’s stock has fallen and is now trading below its initial offering price of $35. A similar trend has followed Johnson & Johnson spinoff Kenvue. The footwear and apparel sectors have been under pressure this year as consumers shift their spending from goods to services. But Birkenstock’s growth, sustained profitability and cultural relevance after its recent cameo in the “Barbie” movie have sparked interest from investors. “Birkenstock is a long-standing brand but it fits into the trend of embracing casual comfort in the workplace after COVID. It continues to grow even in the face of a declining global footwear market, as consumers allocate their disposable income to other interests, such as travel,” Alex Smith, global sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, said in an emailed note. “The current growth is being driven by a younger, new consumer base and its rising popularity among celebrities – even Barbie has been spotted wearing Arizona sandals.” Despite its long history, Smith noted Birkenstock still has room to grow. Its customer base is still primarily female customers because of its sizing options and manufacturing capabilities, and it could expand sales outside of the U.S. and Europe.",CNBC
Hugh Son,Goldman Sachs warns of hit to third-quarter earnings on deal to offload GreenSky,"In this article Goldman Sachs said Wednesday that it agreed to sell its fintech lending platform GreenSky to a group of investors led by private equity firm Sixth Street. The deal, which includes a book of loans created by Goldman, will result in a 19 cents per share reduction to third-quarter earnings, Goldman said in the statement. The New York-based bank is scheduled to disclose results Tuesday. The move is the latest step CEO David Solomon has taken to retrench from his ill-fated push into retail banking. Under Solomon’s direction, Goldman acquired GreenSky last year for $1.7 billion, overruling deputies who felt the home improvement lender was a poor fit. Months later, Solomon decided to seek bids for the business amid his broader move away from consumer finance. Goldman also sold a wealth management business and was reportedly in talks to offload its Apple Card operations. “This transaction demonstrates our continued progress in narrowing the focus of our consumer business,” Solomon said in the release. The bank is now focused on its core strengths in investment banking and trading and its push to grow asset and wealth management fees, he added. Goldman will continue to operate GreenSky until the sale closes in the first quarter of 2024, the bank said. The expected hit to third-quarter earnings includes expenses tied to a write down of GreenSky intangibles, as well as marks on the loan portfolio and higher taxes, offset by the release of loan reserves tied to the transaction, Goldman said. It follows a $504 million second-quarter impairment on GreenSky disclosed in July. The Sixth Street group includes funds managed by KKR, Bayview Asset Management and CardWorks, according to the release. Private equity groups have played key roles in several of the banking industry’s asset divestitures since the start of the year, providing funding for the PacWest merger with Banc of California, for example.

Hugh Son,These regional banks are at risk of being booted from the S&P 500,"In this article The stock sell-off that hit regional banks this year has exposed lenders including Zions and Comerica to the risk of being delisted from the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. The banks, each with market capitalizations of around $5 billion, were the fourth- and sixth-smallest members of the 500 company listing as of this week, according to FactSet. That leaves the companies in a similar position to Lincoln National, which got shunted from the S&P 500 last month and placed into a small-cap index. Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, took Lincoln National’s spot. This year’s regional banking crisis has already caused changes in the composition of the S&P 500, the most popular broad measure of large American companies in the investing world. Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic were removed from the benchmark after deposit runs led to their government seizure. More changes may be coming, especially if the industry faces a protracted slump, according to analysts. “It’s absolutely a risk,” Chris Marinac, research director at Janney Montgomery Scott, said in an interview. “If the market were to further change the valuation of these companies, especially if we have higher rates, I wouldn’t rule it out.” Banks begin disclosing third-quarter results Friday, led by JPMorgan Chase . Investors are keen to hear how rising interest rates affected bond holdings and deposits in the period. Companies that no longer qualify as large-cap stocks are at heightened risk of demotion from the S&P 500. There were seven members valued at $6 billion or less at the end of August. Two of them were removed the following month: insurer Lincoln National and consumer firm Newell Brands . Those that join the benchmark often celebrate the milestone. The popularity of mutual funds and ETFs based on the index means that new members typically see an immediate boost to their stock price. Those that get demoted can suffer declines as fewer money managers need to own shares in the companies. To be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500, companies need to have a market capitalization of at least $14.5 billion and meet profitability and trading standards. Members that violate “one or more of the eligibility criteria for the S&P Composite 1500 may be deleted from the respective component index at the Index Committee’s discretion,” according to S&P Dow Jones Indices’ methodology. Still, that doesn’t mean Zions or Comerica are on the cusp of a delisting. The committee that decides the composition of the S&P 500 looks to minimize churn and accurately represent reference sectors, making changes only when “ongoing conditions warrant an index change,” according to S&P. For instance, after the onset of the Covid pandemic in March 2020, many retail S&P 500 companies temporarily violated the profitability rule, but that didn’t result in widespread demotions, according to a person who has studied the S&P 500 index. S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment for this article, as did Comerica. Zion’s didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment. Besides Zions and Comerica, KeyCorp and Citizens Financial are the only other S&P 500 banks with market caps below the threshold for inclusion in the index, according to an Aug. 31 Piper Sandler note. KeyCorp and Citizens, however, each have market caps of greater than $10 billion, making them less likely to be impacted than smaller banks. After Blackstone became the first major alternative asset manager to join the S&P 500 last month, analysts said that peers including KKR and Apollo Global may be next, and they would likely replace other financial names. KKR and Apollo each have market capitalizations of greater than $50 billion. “Perhaps more demotions of low-market cap financials are to come,” Wells Fargo analyst Finian O’Shea said in a Sept. 5 research note. – CNBC’s Gabriel Cortes contributed to this article.",CNBC
Laya Neelakandan,Disney World and Disneyland raise prices for passes and tickets,"In this article It’s about to get a bit more expensive to experience the magic of Walt Disney World and Disneyland. The parks are increasing a wide variety of prices for passes, effective immediately, including parking and annual passes. The parks’ most basic tickets, date-based day passes, will remain unchanged and vary based on the busyness of the date. At Disneyland, that least expensive option will run you $104 — consistent since before the pandemic — and at Disney World it’ll cost $109. At Disney World in Orlando, annual price passes jumped by nearly 10%, with the most expensive Incredi-Pass now selling for $1,449. Parking at the theme park will also rise by $5 to $30 total, but it’s free for hotel guests. And beginning Jan. 9, “Park Hopper” tickets will return, allowing vacationers to travel between parks at any time of day. At Disneyland in Anaheim, the highest daily pass increased to $194, a nearly 9% increase from earlier prices. The cost of the Magic Key pass and Genie+ add-ons also jumped. Parking at the California park will also see higher pricing. “We are constantly adding new, innovative attractions and entertainment to our parks and, with our broad array of pricing options, the value of a theme park visit is reflected in the unique experiences that only Disney can offer,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. The price hikes come a week after Disney announced promotions for child tickets as low as $50 as theme parks report a slowdown in attendance. Disney recently said it plans to nearly double its investment in its park division as it emerges from shutdowns that devastated the industry during the pandemic. “As Disney considers future growth opportunities, there is a deep well of stories that have yet to be fully explored in its theme parks,” the company said in a September presentation. Clarification: This story was updated to specify how the price increases affect admission at each park.",CNBC
Diana Olick,Adjustable-rate mortgage demand spiked last week. Here’s why.,"The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage rose to the highest level since 2000 last week, but rates on adjustable-rate mortgages fell. That caused a run on these so-called ARMs, pushing total mortgage application volume very slightly higher, up 0.6% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.67% from 7.53%, for loans with a 20% down payment. But the average contract interest rate for 5/1 ARMs decreased to 6.33% from 6.49%. ARMs usually offer much lower rates because they have shorter fixed terms. The difference between ARM rates and the 30-year fixed rate, however, has been unusually narrow recently. Last week, it widened. “The level of ARM applications increased by 15% over the week, bringing the ARM share up to 9.2% of all applications, the highest share since November 2022,” wrote Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist, in a release. “The yield curve has become less inverted in recent weeks and ARM pricing has certainly improved.” Applications to refinance a home loan inched up 0.3% from the previous week and were 9% lower than the same week one year ago. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 1% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week one year ago. “Application activity remains depressed and close to multi-decade lows, with purchase applications still almost 20% behind last year’s pace,” added Kan. The average loan size is now at its lowest level since 2017. This indicates that most of the sales activity is happening at the lower end of the market. At the very high end, buyers tend to use all cash, and in the middle range affordability has been hit so hard that the market is essentially frozen. At an open house in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, there were plenty of potential buyers looking, but most said that was all they were doing: just looking. The house was priced at $1.54 million. “In this first two weeks of October, as anticipated, inventories have taken a jump, but then because interest rates have taken a jump too, we’re seeing less buyers. Lots of traffic, but not a lot of actual shoppers,” said Lisa Resch, a real estate agent with Compass who listed the home.",CNBC
John Rosevear,ChargePoint shares fall after EV charging operator announces $232 million raise,"In this article Shares of EV charging network operator ChargePoint Holdings closed sharply lower Wednesday after the company said it’s raising $232 million via stock sales. The company’s stock was down over 15% at Wednesday’s market close. ChargePoint said in a statement that a group of institutional investors has agreed to purchase $175 million in newly issued stock. The company also disclosed it has raised $57 million during the current fiscal quarter via its existing “at-the-market” stock offering facility, for a total of $232 million in new funds. CFO Rex Jackson said in a statement that the new funds, together with a recently secured credit line, will support the company into early 2025. “These raises and our recently announced $150M revolving credit facility are consistent with our announced capital strategy to bolster our balance sheet,” Jackson said, adding the company has no further plans to offer stock via its at-the-market facility. ChargePoint also disclosed that it has altered the terms of a prior $300 million convertible notes deal to give the company another year to pay back the funding but straps it with higher interest payments. ChargePoint’s shares closed at $4.49 on Tuesday, down about 53% since the beginning of 2023.",CNBC
Cait Freda,Period care brands form coalition to fight the ‘tampon tax’,"Starting Wednesday, consumers paying state sales tax on menstrual products will be able to get those costs on some period care purchases reimbursed. The Tampon Tax Back Coalition — an initiative of period care brands August, Cora, LOLA, The Honey Pot, Rael, Here We Flo, Saalt and DIVA — will reimburse consumers for the tax paid on eligible items sold by the eight participating brands. The coalition aims to stop the “tampon tax,” a term used to describe the state sales tax imposed on products such as tampons, pads and menstrual cups in more than a dozen U.S. states. Many states exempt essential products such as food and medications from being subject to sales tax but leave out period care products, because their current state tax codes consider them nonessential goods. “So much of the work that has to be done is changing public opinion, putting that public pressure on legislators,” said Nadya Okamoto, co-founder of August, an inclusive period care brand focusing on providing products for all menstruators, not just those who identify as female. “We’ve made some progress, but there’s still quite a bit of ways to go.” Twenty-one states in the U.S. tax menstrual items at “standard rates,” meaning tampons and pads are taxed at the same rate as any other nonessential product you would pick up at your local retailer, according to data from the Alliance for Period Supplies. The annual cost of the taxes to consumers totals roughly $80 million, according to Period Law, a group recruiting volunteer attorneys to help advance period equity legislation. The Tampon Tax Back Coalition was born out of an initiative by August that launched in May. Now with seven additional brands on board, the coalition said it is prioritizing the customer and making the reimbursement process easier. “This is something that shouldn’t exist,” Okamoto said. “A customer shouldn’t have to text multiple different places or figure out the logistics of how they get the ‘tampon tax’ back if they’re buying one brand of tampons, one brand pads.” Yanghee Paik, CEO of Rael, a clean feminine care and skincare startup, called the coalition a “big step” toward sending a message that period care products are essential to covering “basic medical needs.” “Not many people really have the awareness of this issue in the country,” said Paik, adding the tax is “very, very backward.” Beatrice Dixon, CEO at The Honey Pot, said it was not until she started her own period care brand that she learned about the tampon tax: “Before that, I didn’t even know that I as a consumer was even paying that.”  Dixon described the decision to get involved in the coalition as a “no-brainer.” To get reimbursed, customers can visit the coalition’s website and start a claim for reimbursement within 10 days of the date of purchase for eligible items sold by the eight participating brands. Customers will be refunded via Venmo or PayPal within 24 hours of their submissions, according to the coalition.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,"Stellantis, Samsung SDI to build $3.2 billion EV battery plant in Indiana","In this article DETROIT — Samsung SDI and automaker Stellantis plan to invest more than $3.2 billion in a new electric vehicle battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana. The facility — Stellantis’ sixth battery plant announced globally — was largely expected, but the location and timing are notable. The announcement Wednesday was made during contentious U.S. labor strikes and contract negotiations between Stellantis and the United Auto Workers union, led by UAW President Shawn Fain, who is from Kokomo. Battery plants have become a main issue in the labor talks, as the UAW views EV battery jobs as crucial to its long-term viability. General Motors last week agreed to include workers at its EV battery plant in the company’s national contract with the union, which Fain called a “transformative win.” Fain said the union expects Stellantis and Ford Motor to follow suit, including battery plant workers in eventual contract agreements. “The plan was to draw down engine and transmission plants and permanently replace them with low-wage battery jobs,” Fain said Friday. “We had a different plan, and our plan is winning at GM. And we expect it to win at Ford and Stellantis as well.” Stellantis declined to comment on details of the ongoing negotiations or timing of the announcement. EV battery plants are key to the automaker’s plans to build models such as electric versions of its Ram pickup truck and Dodge muscle car. The new Stellantis battery plant is the second to be planned in Kokomo through a joint venture between the automaker and Samsung SDI called StarPlus Energy. The two plants are expected to create 2,800 new jobs, according to the company. The first facility, a $2.5 billion plant, is under construction. It’s scheduled to begin production during the first quarter of 2025. The second plant is expected to begin production of battery cells in early 2027. “Our battery ecosystem is the foundation of our electrification strategy and our great partners Samsung SDI, the State of Indiana, and the City of Kokomo have created a compelling case for locating our sixth gigafactory in Kokomo,” Mark Stewart, Stellantis COO North America, said in a statement.",CNBC
Bertha Coombs,Walgreens names veteran health-care executive Tim Wentworth as next CEO,"In this article Walgreens Boots Alliance has chosen veteran health care executive Tim Wentworth as the company’s new chief executive. Wentworth is the former CEO of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits management company, Express Scripts, which was acquired by Cigna in 2018. He stayed on and served as chief of Cigna’s health services, before retiring at the of 2021. “What made me decide to come back was a chance to lead this iconic brand and company at a time when it’s not in a steady state,” Wentworth told CNBC. “It’s a massive platform... they touch almost 10 million people a day.” Wentworth will start on Oct. 23, almost two months after Roz Brewer stepped down as CEO, at a time when the company is facing a number of challenges in trying to transition to becoming a provider of health services beyond the pharmacy counter. Under Brewer’s tenure, Walgreens took a major stake in primary care provider VillageMD, acquired specialty pharmacy provider Shields Health, as well as homecare provider CareCentrix. Trying to integrate and scale the businesses has pressured Walgreens’ earnings. The transition has come at a time when pharmacy revenue has been pressured by falling demand for Covid vaccines and over-the-counter tests. In June, the company’s third-quarter profits missed Wall Street estimates for the first time in three years. Walgreens’ board has said they were intent on hiring an executive with deep health experience who could rein in all of the new services. “I came from one of the great efficiency companies at Express Scripts — I mean, we were built to drive out waste from health care and and we looked at everything through that lens. And that has to do by starting with our own cost structure, and there’s no question inside this company that’s every bit as important,” said Wentworth. Walgreens’ executive chairman Stefano Pessina said Wentworth “is an accomplished and respected leader with profound expertise in the payer and pharmacy space as well as supply chain, IT and Human Resources. We are confident he is the right person to lead WBA’s next phase of growth into a customer-centric healthcare company.” The company’s core pharmacy business is also facing challenges. This week, pharmacists in several cities have walked off the job to protest understaffing at pharmacies which the non-union workers say endangers patients.  Wentworth says during Covid the drugstore chains pivoted quickly to become major providers of vaccines and supported patients with information. “When you’re in a business that’s having to respond that quickly to something that is that unusual. You don’t get it all right. And I have no doubt that the leadership at Walgreens is taking a look and listening to their folks,” he said. “As a leader, I can tell you, there’s nothing that motivates me more than ensuring every employee feels like they’re supported in that mission.” Walgreens is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Leslie Picker,Birkenstock prices IPO at $46 per share,"In this article Birkenstock, the longtime German shoe brand known for its comfy and durable styles, priced its IPO at $46 per share on Tuesday, giving it a tentative valuation of about $8.64 billion. The pricing came in just shy of the midpoint of Birkenstock’s stated range of $44 to $49 per share and gives it a market cap that’s above Crocs and in line with Swiss shoe brand On Running . Birkenstock had originally sought a valuation of up to $9.2 billion. The company initially expected to sell about 10.75 million ordinary shares in the offering and could raise around $495 million when it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “BIRK.”  Combined with the 21.51 million in shares its selling stockholders were looking to offload, the offering could bring in around $1.48 billion. Birkenstock’s offering comes as the IPO market remains choppy after a number of recent filers began trading in muted debuts.  Instacart priced its long awaited IPO at $30 per share last month. But after an initial 40% pop, it closed at $33.70 on its first day on the Nasdaq and is now trading below its opening share price. Similar trends have followed Johnson & Johnson spinoff Kenvue and beauty and wellness firm Oddity Tech .  Birkenstock, which has been in the footwear business since 1774, is going public about two years after private equity firm L Catterton took a majority stake in the business at a valuation of $4.85 billion. It decided to go public so it can boost its valuation and gain access to the capital markets, and plans to use proceeds from the offering to pay off loans, according to a securities filing.  The company’s growth – and the bump in relevancy it received after its recent cameo in the “Barbie” movie – has attracted interest from investors, even as the footwear sector faces pressure from a slowdown in consumer spending and a shift to services over goods. Between fiscal 2020 and 2022, sales jumped from 728 million euros ($771 million) to 1.24 billion euros ($1.32 billion) as the company leaned into its direct-to-consumer strategy, exited certain wholesale partnerships in key markets and boosted sales of items with higher price points.  It posted a net income of about 187 million euros ($198 million) in fiscal 2022. ",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Have tickets to the Taylor Swift movie this weekend? Get ready for a dance party,"Take us to church, Taylor. Starting Friday, Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour film arrives in theaters, and with it comes a certain expectation of exuberance from those in attendance. Friendship bracelet swapping, outfits dripping with shimmery crystals, hands painted with the number 13 and lots of dancing are all part of the concert experience — and expressly encouraged. Movie theater chains, such as distributor AMC Entertainment , have told audiences they can sing and dance in the auditoriums, but should refrain from dancing on seats or blocking other guests’ view of the big screen. Phones, too, are allowed so long as moviegoers don’t record the concert film. So, expect a lot of selfies during the 2 hour and 48 minute event. “Have the best time, but please be respectful of other guests enjoying the concert film or other movies at AMC,” the company wrote on its website ahead of Friday’s release. Each cinema has its own rules, so audiences are encouraged to check with their local theater before showing up for their screening. However, it’s expected that most will be lax when it comes to traditional theater etiquette. The showings are likely to be reminiscent of specialty screenings of films such as “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” where audiences participate in chants and other rituals. So, get ready to shout “One, two, three, let’s go b----!” at the start of “Delicate” and double clap during the bridge of “You Belong With Me.” Since Swift announced the theatrical release of her The Eras Tour, ticket sales have soared. AMC reported last week that presales had already exceeded $100 million for its theaters, and expectations are that the film will easily surpass that figure in its opening weekend. Cinemas have shown taped concerts in the past, but few have driven the fervor for ticket sales like Swift. The excitement, which has led movie theaters to design specialty popcorn buckets, create boutique cocktails and even set up friendship bracelet-making tables, illustrates there’s a hunger for making something bigger and more memorable out of a trip to the movies. It’s also likely why a documentary on Beyonce’s “Renaissance” album and tour is coming to theaters in December. Both Swift and Beyonce’s films are being sold as premium experiences, with higher-priced tickets. The Eras Tour film has ticket prices starting at $13.13 for children and $19.89 for adults, but seats in IMAX, Dolby and other premium formats cost a bit more. Beyonce’s film will see base tickets set at $22 a piece. For comparison, average adult ticket prices for regular film releases in 2023 have ranged between $11 and $14 apiece for standard formats. “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” will play in theaters during the weekends through Nov. 5.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,GM reaches deal with Canadian autoworkers hours after union initiates strikes,"In this article DETROIT — General Motors has reached a tentative agreement for nearly 4,300 Canadian autoworkers after the union representing those workers called a national strike early Tuesday. Canadian union Unifor said Tuesday afternoon the “strike actions are on hold to allow the membership to vote on the tentative agreement.” A majority of workers must vote in support of the pact for ratification. Unifor initiated a national strike after the sides failed to reach a deal by an 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline. The strike briefly affected an assembly plant that produces light- and heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado trucks; production of some V6 and V8 engines used in a variety of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox and GM’s full-size SUVs; a stamping facility; and a parts distribution center. “When faced with the shutdown of these key facilities General Motors had no choice but to get serious at the table and agree to the pattern,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a release. The Canadian engine plant marked a major concern for the automaker, which also is facing U.S. strikes by the United Auto Workers union. The facility produces engines for highly profitable full-size pickup trucks and SUVS, among other vehicles. GM, in a statement, confirmed the “record” tentative agreement: “This record agreement, subject to member ratification, recognizes the many contributions of our represented team members with significant increases in wages, benefits and job security while building on GM’s historic investments in Canadian manufacturing.” Unifor said the tentative deal with GM follows a ratified agreement reached last month with Ford Motor. The agreement, which covers more than 5,600 workers at Ford facilities in Canada, was ratified by 54% of workers who voted.  The union said the three-year GM deal — like the agreement with Ford — includes hourly wage increases of up to 25%, reactivation of a cost-of-living allowance to battle inflation and a shorter progression for workers to reach top pay, among other new or altered benefits. Prior to Tuesday, GM and Unifor had been at odds over making temporary workers permanent employees, pension funding and other demands. Payne said all temp workers will become permanent employees by the end of the three-year deal. “All members will benefit now that the pattern is in place at GM, whether they’re temporary workers, new hires, or already at the top of the pay scale,” said Unifor GM master bargaining chair Jason Gale. “This agreement delivers the kind of historic pay increases our members need and significant pension improvements that will protect their living standards in retirement.”  GM declined to discuss details of the agreement prior to the union ratification vote. If ratified, Unifor will move onto negotiations with Chrysler-parent Stellantis , which has the largest footprint of the Detroit automakers in Ontario, Canada. “I expect Stellantis will come here kicking and screaming the same way General Motors did,” Payne said Tuesday during a news conference. Unifor, which represents 18,000 Canadian workers at the Detroit automakers, took a more traditional approach to its negotiations than its U.S. counterpart. The Canadian union is negotiating with each automaker separately, using one deal as a “pattern” for each company. That traditional patterned-bargaining approach runs counter to the UAW’s new strategy of bargaining with all three automakers at once. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand-up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts. Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike.",CNBC
Amelia Lucas,"PepsiCo beats Wall Street estimates, raises earnings outlook","In this article PepsiCo on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations and raised its outlook for its full-year earnings. Shares of the company rose 2% in premarket trading. Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: For 2023, Pepsi now expects constant currency earnings per share growth of 13%, up from its prior forecast of 12%. It’s the third consecutive quarter that the snacking and beverage giant has hiked its full-year forecast. Pepsi reported third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.09 billion, or $2.24 per share, up from $2.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $2.25 per share. Net sales rose 6.7% to $23.45 billion. The company’s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 8.8% in the quarter. But PepsiCo’s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, fell again this quarter. Pepsi’s price hikes to mitigate inflation have weakened demand for its products. The company has also been shrinking portions and making smaller value packs to drive more transactions, Pepsi executives told analysts on a conference call. That strategy results in more affordable options for consumers — and lower volume sold. Pepsi’s North American beverages unit reported volume declines of 6%. CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has pruned some promotions, such as for its bottled water business, in order to preserve margins. But those deals drove volume for the drinks, gains that disappeared without the promotions. There were some bright spots in beverages. Gatorade, for example, saw double-digit revenue growth. The company also plans to relaunch Mountain Dew Baja Blast, a fan favorite flavor that is available only at Taco Bell. The company’s North American food divisions performed better than the beverages unit did. Quaker Foods North America’s volume rose 1%, while Frito-Lay North America’s volume was flat. Quaker Foods’ brands also gained market share in key categories, such as pancake mix and syrup, executives said in prepared remarks. Looking to 2024, Pepsi anticipates organic revenue growth on the high end of 4% to 6% and core constant currency earnings per share growth in the high single digits.",CNBC
Courtney Reagan,Nike is supreme among teen shoppers. Here are the other brands they love most,"In this article Teens are a notoriously fickle bunch — but the group is also often on the leading edge of many trends the rest of us eventually adopt. In many ways, the cohort’s spending habits reflect those seen in the U.S. at large. Teens’ self-reported annual spending is down 1% to $2,316 compared to last fall, and down 4% from the spring, according to Piper Sandler’s biannual teen survey released Tuesday. Interestingly, male teens report spending 11% more than last fall, while females are spending 8% less. High prices appear to be weighing on teens as much as they are on other age groups in the U.S. When asked about the biggest political and social issues today, inflation was second behind the environment — the economy was fifth. When teens are spending, 37% said they are using funds earned from a part-time job, while 62% said parents contribute to spending. One company reigned among teen spenders. Despite a rocky financial performance recently, Nike remains the favorite brand for apparel and footwear for both male and female teens for the 12th year running in the survey that has been conducted for 22 years. Other fashion and beauty brands have been moving around in preference during that time. Teens are spending 4% less on clothing compared to last year, down to $563 per year. Females are outspending males by about $180, slightly less than the difference in the spring version of the survey. After Nike, American Eagle and Lululemon are the second- and third-most preferred brands among teens, the same as in the spring. While Shein moved up to the No. 4 spot from No. 5, overtaking H&M, the company’s market share fell 1 percentage point.  Teens are also putting less money into footwear. Spending dropped 3% to $305 a year. Males outspend females on shoes by about $80 a year. Converse held the spot for the second-most favorite brand behind Nike but dropped in market share by 1 percentage point. Adidas held the No. 3 spot, and New Balance gained 2 percentage points of market share to become the fourth favorite brand. It surpassed Vans, which lost share and fell to the No. 5 spot. Crocs and Crocs-owned Hey Dude come in at No. 6 and No. 7, respectively. On Running emerged in the top 10, claiming the No. 8 spot. Birkenstock, which is set to go public this week, did not make the top 10, and hasn’t for at least the last four surveys. Teens are shopping more at off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx , Ross Stores , Marshalls and Nordstrom Rack, as well as online. They’re buying less at specialty stores, discounters such as Target and Walmart , outlets and secondhand options. Amazon dominates as the online shopping site of choice. Shein comes up second, but with just 7% of share compared to Amazon’s 59%. StockX and Temu moved into the top 10 after not making the list in the spring. Princess Polly and GOAT fell out of the top 10. When teens were asked what the top fashion trends were in school, “leggings/Lululemon” held the top spot for females as it has for at least the last four surveys. It was followed by crop tops and jeans at No. 2 and No. 3, respectively. They rose from the No. 4 and No. 5 trend in the spring, as UGG Australia boots dropped from second-most named trend for females to sixth. “Baggy/saggy pants” were the fifth-most named trend for females. When asked about top trends, males named “Nike/Jordans” as No. 1, as they have for at least the last four surveys. Athletic wear was second, and “baggy/saggy pants” was third for male fashion trends. Hoodies fell to fifth from second in the spring, and short shorts popped up at No. 9 as a top trend for males in school. Teens are spending $324 a year on beauty, up 23% from last year. The jump was led by a 33% increase in cosmetics, marking the highest spending level in the category since 2019. In cosmetics, e.l.f. remains the top makeup brand, and gained in share from the spring and last year. Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty held the No. 2 spot and gained share over last year. Maybelline held the third spot.  Skin care spending grew 19% over last year, and CeraVe was the top skin care brand. The Ordinary, owned by Estée Lauder, comes in second and L’Oreal-owned La Roche-Posay gained two spots to land at No. 3. Fragrance spending, meanwhile, grew 14% over last fall. Bath & Body Works is No. 1 in the category, but its market share fell 7 percentage points from last year. Hair care spending increased 5% from last year. Olaplex was the favorite brand, though it held the lowest share seen in this survey.  Teens are shifting where they buy beauty. Sephora unseated Ulta as the top destination for beauty for the first time in five years. Both Sephora and Ulta have shop presences within other major retailers’ stores, at Kohl’s and Target, respectively. Target, Amazon and Walmart make up the top five in the beauty category. T.J. Maxx made the list at No. 10 for the first time in at least the last four surveys.  Methodology: Piper Sandler’s survey results come from answers from nearly 9,200 teens with an average age of 15.7 years old, surveyed in 49 U.S. states with an average household income of $70,725.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,Supreme Court declines to hear case challenging FDA rejection of flavored vapes,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear arguments in a case challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s authority to reject approvals of flavored electronic cigarettes.  The case is one of several challenges to the FDA’s regulation of the vaping industry, which has hooked members of a new generation on nicotine, and ballooned into an $8.2 billion market in less than a decade.  The 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in December ruled that the FDA has the power to deny applications for flavored e-cigarette products because of its mandate to protect public health by discouraging younger people from smoking. The lower court ruling rebuffed an appeal by Avail Vapor, a vape retailer, which argues that the FDA unfairly denied its product applications based on requirements the agency “secretly” changed without notifying companies. Avail’s attorney, Eric Heyer, told CNBC on Tuesday that the company is “disappointed that the Supreme Court declined to review the flawed process by which FDA issued its marketing denial orders to Avail without adequate prior notice of the specific longitudinal comparative efficacy study requirements the agency ultimately imposed.” The FDA issues marketing denial orders to reject product applications. A spokesperson for the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court’s decision. In 2016, the FDA determined that e-cigarettes were subject to its regulation, like traditional tobacco products. E-cigarettes are handheld devices used to inhale a vapor, which usually contains nicotine, flavoring and other chemicals.  The agency gave companies until September 2020 to submit applications for approval of each of their vape products, even if they were already on the market.  The FDA in March said nearly seven million applications were submitted by that deadline, but the agency has rejected more than 1 million of them. The case is related to the FDA’s 2021 decision to reject all of Avail Vapor’s applications for its fruit- and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA said Avail did not present long-term studies demonstrating that its sweet-flavored vapes were more effective at helping adult smokers quit than tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes. The agency said those studies are necessary to demonstrate that the benefits of Avail’s products to adults outweigh their risks to youth. Children, teens and young adults are more attracted to e-cigarettes that mimic the taste of sweet treats, according to the FDA. Avail’s applications included four studies that surveyed patients on the safety and usability of a few of the company’s products and e-cigarettes overall, but that research did not make any comparisons to tobacco-flavored vapes. The company also outlined its marketing measures, including age verification for online sales, designed to prevent underage use of its flavored e-cigarettes.  Avail in its appeal to the 4th Circuit had argued that the FDA had not said it would need to see long-term studies comparing the company’s fruit and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes with tobacco-flavored vapes.  “The FDA says Avail and other retailers should have known what they were going to be looking for. Well, virtually nobody in the industry knew,” Heyer told CNBC. “The lack of those comparative efficacy studies was one of the main reasons why the FDA denied these applications,” he added. “The FDA had five years to communicate this to applicants and they never did. Not a single word.” Avail also argued that the FDA was obligated to consider the marketing plan included in its applications. But 4th Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in December that Avail “encourages us to neglect the forest for the trees” by focusing on procedural objections rather than the FDA’s mandate to “ensure that another generation of Americans does not become addicted to nicotine and tobacco products.” Wilkinson said the FDA did not reject the applications due to their lack of specific long-term studies. He said the agency followed its mandate by requiring strong, product-specific evidence to evaluate the benefit of new e-cigarette products to adults, which Avail did not provide. Avail exited the retail business after selling all of its 100 brick-and-mortar stores in October 2021, a month after the FDA rejected its applications. Avail is not the only company to challenge application rejections from the FDA. Last year, the FDA ordered Juul products off the market, saying it did not have sufficient evidence that the Juul products weren’t posing public health risks. The e-cigarette giant, which slashed nearly a third of its workforce in a bid to avoid bankruptcy, said the FDA conducted an incorrect and incomplete assessment of its data. The FDA is conducting a secondary review of Juul’s data and has put in place a temporary reprieve that allows all of Juul’s products to stay on the market. The review is still in progress. However, in some cases, the FDA has rescinded, or partially rescinded, rejections following the appeal process. To date, the FDA has authorized 23 tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices. Efforts to restrict e-cigarette flavors favored by teens may have fallen flat as new brands hit the market.  E-cigarette unit sales rose nearly 47% between January 2020 and December 2022. Many popular brands of disposable e-cigarettes on the market are not FDA-approved and are illegal. Clarification: This story was updated to reflect the nature of the FDA’s decision on Juul’s products, and that Juul items on the market remained available while the FDA reviewed its action.",CNBC
Robert Frank,The number of people with at least $100 million has doubled since 2003,"The population of the super wealthy, or those worth $100 million or more, doubled over the past 20 years as asset prices soared around the world, according to a new report. There are now 28,420 so-called centi-millionaires worldwide, up 12% over last year and more than twice the number in 2003, according to a new report from Henley & Partners, a wealth and migration advisory firm, which used data from New World Wealth. The surge in centi-millionaires reflects the rapid rise in asset values fueled by low interest rates, which boosted the values of everything from real estate and land to stocks, private companies and art. The rise of tech wealth, especially in the U.S., has also helped fuel the growth in the super wealthy. The number of billionaires in the world has skyrocketed from under 500 people in 2003 to more than 2,600 people today, according to Forbes and other wealth-tracking firms. Low interest rates and the resulting flood of money across the world since the 2008 financial crisis have also made the money effectively worth less, which has added to the growth of centi-millionaires in terms of dollars. “The value of money has declined, so in dollar terms, you would expect more centi-millionaires,” said Andrew Amoils, head of research at New World Wealth. “It has also been fueled by strong growth in the U.S. and Asia.” Amoils said most of today’s centi-millionaires made their fortunes by starting their own companies or helping fund startups. The U.S. is still the dominant capital of entrepreneurship and centi-millionaires, with 38% of the global population worth $100 million or more, according to the report. Countries with the most centi-millionaires: Cities with the most centi-millionaires: Source: Henley & Partners, New World Wealth With the era of ultra-low interest rates gone for now, the growth rate for centi-millionaires may slow. The report projects the centi-millionaire population will grow 38% over the next decade, from 28,420 people to about 39,000 people by 2033. “It does look like the next 10 years will be slower than the past 10 years,” Amoils said. Although the media tends to focus more on billionaires, the report said centi-millionaires are more representative of the world’s super wealthy. The dollar threshold for what it means to be “super wealthy” has increased rapidly over time, said Juerg Steffen, CEO of Henley & Partners. “Not long ago, in the late 1990s, $30 million was considered by most banks as the fortune that was needed to meet this status,” he said. “However, asset prices have risen significantly since then, making $100 million the new benchmark.” While many smaller, less-developed countries have very few billionaires, they may have dozens or even hundreds of centi-millionaires. Amoils said there is often little visible difference in lifestyle between a person worth $100 million and a billionaire. “They might fly on a private jet and have multiple homes,” he said. “And aside from maybe philanthropy,” their lifestyle would basically look the same.”",CNBC
Michael Wayland,"Canadian autoworkers strike against General Motors, joining UAW","In this article DETROIT — Labor strikes are now an international issue for General Motors after the Detroit automaker failed to reach a tentative agreement by Monday for roughly 4,300 workers represented by Canadian union Unifor. The Canadian autoworkers will join roughly 9,200 United Auto Workers members who are on strike in the U.S. at two assembly plants and 18 parts and distribution centers for GM. The U.S. strike started Sept. 15 and has since expanded. The new strikes in the Canadian province of Ontario affect an assembly plant that produces light- and heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado trucks; production of some V-6 and V-8 engines used in a variety of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox; and a stamping facility that produces parts for various cars and trucks. Unifor National President Lana Payne said GM “continues to fall short on our pension demands, income supports for retired workers, and meaningful steps to transition temporary workers into permanent, full-time jobs.” Unifor, which represents 18,000 Canadian workers at the Detroit automakers, took a more traditional approach to its negotiations than its U.S. counterpart. The Canadian union is negotiating with each automaker separately and using a deal first reached last month with Ford as a “pattern” for GM and Chrysler parent Stellantis . Payne said in a release early Tuesday that GM is “stubbornly refusing to meet the pattern agreement.” GM, in a statement, said the company is “disappointed” that a deal couldn’t be reached following “very positive progress on several key priorities over the past weeks.” “We remain at the bargaining table and are committed to keep working with Unifor to reach an agreement that is fair and flexible,” GM said. Ford’s three-year deal included hourly wage increases of up to 25%, reactivation of a cost-of-living allowance to battle inflation and a shorter progression for workers to reach top pay, among other new or altered benefits. The agreement, which covers more than 5,600 workers at Ford facilities in Canada, was ratified by 54% of workers who voted.  That traditional patterned bargaining approach runs counter to the UAW’s new strategy of bargaining with all three automakers at once. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began, after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand-up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts in which all plants simultaneously strike. Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike. UAW President Shawn Fain previously said the union would increase the work stoppages based on progress in the negotiations. Thousands of other UAW members have been laid off as a result of the strikes, including roughly 2,175 workers at other GM facilities. Most notably, the Detroit automaker was forced to idle production of a Kansa assembly plant that produces Chevrolet Malibu sedans and Cadillac XT4 crossovers.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,‘Shark Tank’ star Daymond John’s Black Entrepreneurs Day to return,"“Shark Tank” star Daymond John is looking to give Black business owners a boost for the fourth year running. The FUBU CEO’s Black Entrepreneurs Day, billed as a celebration of Black business, will return Nov. 1. The event will feature a lineup of celebrity guests such as Whoopi Goldberg and Shaquille O’Neal and insights from top Black business leaders. Eight winners of a $25,000 entrepreneurship grant will also get the opportunity to appear alongside John during the event. The event will take place at the Apollo Theater in Manhattan and will also be broadcast online via livestream. This year marks the fourth year of the event, which was first created in part to address “frustration over injustice” after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Black Entrepreneurs Day was launched later that year to “celebrate” Black business owners amid a focus on systemic racism and economic inequities. “I remember when Rodney King happened,” John told CNBC. “I did not go and burn businesses — I built one.” Since 2020, Black Entrepreneurs Day has attracted big-name corporations including JPMorgan Chase ’s Chase for Business and Shopify . As the event enters its fourth year, enthusiasm among corporate sponsors has not matched what it was in 2020, when it launched on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic and widespread Black Lives Matter protests pushing for racial equity. “It was very easy [to get corporations on board] the first year,” John said. “I said, ‘Will you stand by me and say that you are on the right side of this discussion?’” Many of the companies standing behind Black Entrepreneurs Day have launched initiatives to support the Black community. Chase allocated $30 billion as part of a racial equity commitment in 2020, which has since been used to deploy 15,000 small business loans, among other initiatives. John said companies need to show continued support for Black businesses beyond a one-time commitment. “If you don’t have people in your organization that look like the ones you are serving, then you’re going to chase what’s shinier every day,” John said. “You may think that the systemic issues were solved” by the donation you gave. John lauded brands including Chase, T-Mobile, The General Insurance and Shopify, which he said have stayed on the “right side” of the issue. He said the companies don’t just hand over money, but also go the extra mile to invest in the Black community. This year, Black Entrepreneurs Day will feature a star-studded guest list including Goldberg, O’Neal, Cedric the Entertainer, Anthony Anderson and Rick Ross, to discuss their journey as Black entertainers and entrepreneurs. “People want to know what they did at their lowest point and how they got out of circumstances that many of us have been in or are currently in,” John said. Black Entrepreneurs Day will partner with the NAACP to give eight entrepreneurs $25,000 issued through the NAACP Powershift Entrepreneur Grant. Business owners who apply and win one of the eight grants will be able to get mentorship from John and join him during the event broadcast. The grant gets tens of thousands of applications, even outpacing the entries submitted to “Shark Tank,” a globally recognized show, John told CNBC. The Shopify Pitch Competition will return to this year’s Black Entrepreneurs Day. Current Shopify merchants will have the chance to pitch to three judges live during the broadcast. Winners will be awarded $25,000 and mentorship from John. Black-owned businesses were hit especially hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and when federal assistance became available, Black business owners saw less of that money than their white counterparts. “When the money was issued throughout Covid, a lot of Black farmers and African American businesses got a very small percentage of it and it took them much longer to get it,” John said. Paycheck Protection Program loans largely failed to reach areas with the highest concentrations of Black-owned businesses, CNBC reported in 2020. Several businesses have flourished with the money and mentorship provided by the grant, John said, and some business owners are now able to keep their businesses open due in part to the grant funds. Programming note: John will appear on CNBC’s “Mad Money” at 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Hollywood writers ratify new contract with studios,"The Writers Guild of America has officially ratified its new three-year contract with Hollywood studios. The guild on Monday announced that 99% of its membership voted to ratify the new deal, with 8,435 votes for “yes” and only 90 for “no.” The terms of the new agreement go from Sept. 25 through May 1, 2026. “Through solidarity and determination, we have ratified a contract with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of our combined membership,” said Meredith Stiehm, president of Writers Guild of America West. The WGA secured pay increases in each of the next three years, artificial intelligence restrictions and a new residual system for streaming based on viewership. The guild also negotiated higher contribution rates to health benefits and pensions, as well as a guaranteed number of writers in writers’ rooms for television shows. The first productions to return after the strike ended were late-night heavyweights Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert, followed by John Oliver, host of “Last Week Tonight.” Now it’s the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists’ turn. The actors guild began negotiations with the likes of Disney, Paramount, Netflix , Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery last week. “Until the studios make a deal that addresses the needs of performers, WGA members will be on the picket lines, walking side-by-side with SAG-AFTRA in solidarity,” said Lisa Takeuchi Cullen, president of Writers Guild of America East. SAG-AFTRA is looking to improve wages, working conditions and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV. The guild is also looking to standardize the self-tape process. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is part of the AMPTP.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,‘The Exorcist: Believer’ now faces its biggest foe: Taylor Swift,"In this article “The Exorcist: Believer” possessed the box office during its opening weekend, but industry experts wonder if it will continue to turn heads in the weeks to come. The Universal and Blumhouse collaboration, the first of three planned films, tallied $26.5 million during its debut, making it the top-grossing film of the weekend. Yet that haul fell just shy of the $30 million prediction set by box office analysts. With international ticket sales, the film has generated $44 million. Still, on a production budget of just $30 million, “The Exorcist: Believer” could prove profitable if it continues to lure moviegoers in the coming weeks. There’s just one complication: Taylor Swift. “The Exorcist: Believer” fled from its original release date (Oct. 13) because Swift announced her Eras Tour concert film would arrive in cinemas that day. The film quickly snared the coveted, higher priced, premium format screens, leaving little room for “The Exorcist: Believer” to eke out a solid opening. “Moving from Friday the 13th to the 6th was a good move since the inherently strong marketing hook and advantage of having a horror movie opening on this classic day of superstitious importance would’ve likely been outweighed by the overwhelming dominance of that Swift film,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. Representatives for Universal declined to comment. There was a brief notion that the two films could have partnered to become “Exorswift,” an opposites attract double feature like the summer’s “Barbenheimer” (“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer”). The potential same-day opening was almost immediately shut down when “The Exorcist: Believer” moved its release date up a week. Even producer Jason Blum, head of Blumhouse, was open to the idea. Dergarabedian threw cold water on how well the combination would have worked, however. “The notion that an ‘Exorswift’ mashup could have somehow been comparable to the ‘Barbenheimer’ phenomenon is patently absurd given the unlikelihood that legions of Swifties would have an interest in a very R-rated horror movie like ‘The Exorcist: Believer,’” he said. “Thus going all in on a head-to-head matchup with Swift might have proved disastrous.” After all, Swift’s Eras Tour concert film is already a $100 million blockbuster — and that’s just from presales from AMC Entertainment cinemas which doesn’t include dozens of other theater chains’ sales. In moving the week before Swift’s film opening, “The Exorcist: Believer” was able to control a higher number of premium screens and more audience attention. Around 34% of all theatrical foot traffic over the weekend was for the film, according to data from EntTelligence. Competition for that traffic included a new “Paw Patrol” film and a number of R-rated features like “Saw X,” “The Nun II,” “The Equalizer 3” and “Expend4bles.” Box office analysts foresee a sharp drop in ticket sales from “The Exorcist: Believer’s” opening weekend to its second week. A decline is typical for horror movies, but Swift’s film will exacerbate it, the predict. Word of mouth could also be a factor. Horror movies are usually review-proof, often performing well theatrically despite critical panning. As of Monday, “The Exorcist: Believer” holds a 22% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics and a 59% audience rating. With several more weeks before Halloween, the film could still pull in moviegoers looking for a fright. There’s a good reason why Universal couldn’t take the risk on Exorswift. The studio badly needs “The Exorcist: Believer” and its planned sequels to be hits. (The next film, “The Exorcist: Deceiver,” is due April 2025.) Universal and its streaming partner, Peacock, paid more than $400 million for the rights to The Exorcist brand. Through that investment, the studio has planned a trilogy of films. The company is also able to place previous Exorcist films on Peacock and integrate the IP in other ways, like Halloween Horror Nights at its domestic theme parks. Still, no movie in the franchise, except for the original, has grossed more than $42 million domestically, according to Comscore. In fact, not counting “Believer,” all of the five sequels and prequels since the first movie have grossed under $150 million combined. How “Exorcist” films have fared at the domestic box office: Source: Comscore *Special edition re-release of the original “The Exorcist is not a brand or series that’s been prevalent in the pop culture consciousness for decades now, and its few sequels beforehand never lived up to the iconic box office run of the 1973 original,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “The industry may have gotten a little carried away in expecting a bigger run just because this Exorcist sequel has the Blumhouse name on it.” “The Exorcist,” released on the day after Christmas in 1973, grossed $193 million domestically, and the “Version You’ve Never Seen” re-release, which featured additional scenes, scored $40 million in 2000. Otherwise, the franchise is cursed at the box office. “Exorcist II,” which was made in 1977 without creator William Peter Blatty’s involvement, is widely considered one of the worst sequels ever made. Blatty, who died in 2017, wrote and directed 1990′s “The Exorcist III,” but he said the movie’s production company, Morgan Creek, forced him to severely compromise his vision. (The movie has since grown in stature among fans and critics.) Then there was an ill-fated attempt to produce a prequel film in the 2000s that resulted in two wildly different movies. A generally well-regarded TV series ran on Fox for two seasons in 2016 and 2017, but it was canceled after a significant decline in ratings. “Will the franchise have a higher ceiling in the years to come? That remains to be seen,” Robbins said. “It will largely come down to creative decisions and how the studios make an effort to attract modern horror audiences rather than leaning on a brand that a big portion of today’s moviegoers haven’t been regularly exposed to.” Disclosure: NBCUniversal, which distributes “The Exorcist: Believer,” is the parent company of CNBC and Peacock.

Lillian Rizzo,"Nelson Peltz increases Disney stake, reignites potential proxy battle","In this article A proxy battle between Nelson Peltz and Disney is brewing for the second time this year. Peltz’s activist firm, Trian Fund Management, has increased its stake in Disney to about 30 million shares, valued at roughly $2.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The stake makes Trian one of the largest shareholders in Disney. The move comes less than a year after Peltz dropped his initial proxy fight with Disney, and days after the company’s stock reached a 52-week-low. The firm plans to push for multiple seats on the board this time, including one for Peltz, the people said. Earlier this year, the firm sought only a spot for Peltz. The nomination window for new board members opens on Dec. 5 and runs until Jan. 4, according to public filings. If Disney rejects Trian’s proposal, the firm could nominate directors during the open window to be voted on at the company’s annual meeting in spring 2024. A Disney representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Peltz increased his Disney stake. It’s been nearly a year since Bob Iger returned as Disney’s CEO. The company has struggled to make its streaming unit profitable and has announced other initiatives to turn around its business. Iger has opened the door to selling some of Disney’s assets, particularly its TV networks business. He has also considered looking for an investor in sports channel ESPN. “After coming back, I realized the company is facing a lot of challenges, some of them self-inflicted,” Iger told CNBC’s David Faber in July. Iger managed to ward off Peltz in February after the company unveiled a vast restructuring plan that included cost cuts and 7,000 layoffs. Disney said it would slash $5.5 billion in costs, consisting of $3 billion from content, excluding sports, and another $2.5 billion from non-content costs. When Trian launched its proxy fight in January, the firm had owned about 9.4 million shares valued at roughly $900 million. Peltz had criticized Disney’s $71 billion acquisition of Fox in 2019, its failed succession planning and what he called “weak corporate governance” over the years that has depleted shareholder value. It’s unclear if Trian has any specific operational ideas for Disney that Iger hasn’t already proposed or has privately rejected. Trian released a slide presentation in January showcasing Disney’s stock underperformance and the activist fund’s own track record of improving corporate valuation. The fund spent several slides noting how Disney’s acquisition of the majority of 21st Century Fox’s assets has failed to generate a return for shareholders. Trian also focused on Disney’s inability to find a successor for Iger. The Disney board and Iger have been vetting succession candidates since Iger returned to the CEO job in November, according to people familiar with the matter, and have targeted early 2025 as a logical time to set up that transition. In July, Disney extended Iger’s contract by another two years to 2026. The succession process has remained a key issue for the company and its leader. Iger returned to Disney following a fallout with Bob Chapek, has handpicked successor.",CNBC
Leslie Josephs,"Airlines cancel Israel flights, tours scramble to change trips after attacks","Several airlines have suspended service to Israel after surprise attacks by Hamas and Israeli retaliation left hundreds dead and thousands injured. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday that nine U.S. citizens were killed. Some U.S. citizens are still unaccounted for “and we are working with our Israeli partners to determine their whereabouts,” he said. A National Security Council spokesperson said that the U.S. is not “actively” considering an evacuation of U.S. citizens. Meanwhile the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday sent a notice to pilots stating “operators are advised to exercise extreme caution when operating” in the Tel Aviv area because of the attacks. United Airlines , Delta Air Lines and American Airlines each scrubbed service to Tel Aviv. Delta said Monday that it would suspend its nonstop flights to and from Tel Aviv through at least the end of October and said it will work with customers to get them out of Israel through partner airlines. United Flight 954, which departed San Francisco Friday night for Israel, turned back near Greenland, according to flight-tracker FlightAware. “Our Tel Aviv flights will remain suspended until conditions allow them to resume,” United said on Sunday. American flights scheduled for early this week were also canceled. Germany-based Lufthansa Group said all of its flights, including those on Swiss International Air Lines and Austrian Airlines, were suspended into Tel Aviv. Swiss International Air Lines is planning to send an Airbus A321 with seating for 219 passengers to Tel Aviv on Tuesday in coordination with the Swiss government “intended to offer Swiss nationals in Israel the opportunity of a prompt return to their home country.” All scheduled commercial service on the airline is canceled through at least Saturday. “We regret having to do so,” the airline said in a statement. “We are monitoring developments closely and remain in close contact with the relevant authorities.” British Airways also canceled flights this weekend and reduced service early in the week. Air France said its Tel Aviv service was canceled “until further notice,” while European budget airlines Wizz and easyJet canceled flights to Tel Aviv through at least Monday. Israeli airline El Al said Sunday that its flights were “operated as scheduled” and said it was expanding its schedule to help offset the cancellations. Emirates Airline also continued to operate flights between Tel Aviv to Dubai, and Turkish Airlines flew between Tel Aviv and Istanbul. El Al and other carriers also offered travel waivers for customers to delay or cancel their trips. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean said it adjusted several itineraries to bypass the area because of the attacks. “Impacted guests are being notified directly,” the company said in a statement. Some tour operators worked to get travelers out of the country quickly. Nadav Peretz, founder of OUTstanding Travel, a Tel Aviv-based tour company that caters to the LGBTQ+ community, said he had more than 30 clients in the country at the time of the attacks and that customers quickly found flights out of the country and were refunded for the rest of their trips. “Unfortunately, we had to send people back to the airport after two or three days of their trip,” Peretz said by phone. Intrepid Travel said it “had a small number” of travelers in the country when the attacks began on Saturday and that all guides and customers are accounted for. Zina Bencheikh, managing director of Intrepid Travel’s Middle East and Africa business, said that the company’s customers who were in the middle of a tour in Israel during the attacks had mostly left the country, with the exception of one who was set to leave on Monday. The company canceled its tours in Israel through the end of the month.",CNBC
Laya Neelakandan,Cruise prices are way up as operators meet surging travel demand,"In this article As vacationers emerge into a post-pandemic travel world, cruises have made a spectacular comeback — and ticket prices are surging. Cruise operators such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruises are setting some ticket prices higher than pre-pandemic levels and are indicating they may raise them further, even as they post pre-Covid profits. According to data from Cruise Critic, a cruise review site owned by Tripadvisor, the average price of a five-night cruise in the Caribbean for December of this year is $736, roughly 37% higher than the average price a year earlier. Compared to 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic decimated the cruising industry, December ticket prices are up 43%. Carnival CEO Josh Weinstein said during a call with Wall Street analysts at the end of September that the company’s third-quarter net revenue per passenger per day reached a record high. The company’s booking volumes likewise hit an all-time high, pushing cruise occupancy and revenue beyond 2019 levels, he said. Especially as costs of labor, food and fuel continue to rise, Carnival executives noted on the call, the company, which owns multiple major cruise brands, is “well-positioned to drive 2024 pricing higher.” A Carnival spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s specific future pricing actions but said in a statement to CNBC that the company has been able to deliver a value of 25% to 50% over “comparable land-based vacation alternatives.” Carnival sees “ample headroom” to close that gap, the spokesperson said. Royal Caribbean CEO Jason Liberty echoed the sentiment, saying on that company’s post-earnings call in July that his company is also considering increasing prices to meet the surge in demand. Aaron Saunders, a senior editor at Cruise Critic, said part of what’s driving the price surge is the comparison to high airfares. As inflation surges, airfare tickets have reached sky-high prices, with international airfare up 26% from 2019, according to an August estimate by fare-tracking company Hopper. With travelers facing higher costs across the broader sector, and considering cruises typically include additional amenities such as meals and entertainment, consumers are likely to gravitate in that direction, Saunders said. That demand is being driven by both seasoned cruisers and first timers, he said, a dynamic the industry hasn’t historically seen much of. Even so, Saunders said he believes the high prices might be here to stay. ″[The higher prices] are likely subject to fluctuation — but what we’re seeing, generally speaking, is that the higher prices are here today, but those higher prices will ping pong around throughout different sectors,” Saunders said, noting that the Caribbean market is currently one of the most popular sectors. “Cruise lines aren’t being required to drop prices the way they used to … they’re just simply not having to lower fares or to really offer too many incentives because people are just booking.” Truist Securities analyst Patrick Scholes said while rising oil prices are important to monitor for context for the cruise industry, there’s not enough of a correlation between that increase and the increase in cruise prices to explain the propped-up tickets. “They’re raising prices naturally — fuel or no fuel, the demand is there for them to be raising prices,” Scholes said. While in a pre-pandemic world, last-minute bookings meant cheaper deals to secure a cabin, Scholes said, the prices are now so high that they’ll only increase more as the vacation date nears. For now, the record-high ticket prices show no signs of slowing, according to Ashley Kosciolek, senior cruise writer at The Points Guy. Kosciolek noted that the industry is also seeing higher prices for beverage packages and add-on amenities that used to be included in fares. “Let’s also not forget that the industry’s three largest parent companies — Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings — are still paying off billions in debt incurred during the pandemic,” she said.",CNBC
Brandon Gomez,"Hispanic inclusion in corporate America lagged in 2022, new survey finds","Hispanic inclusion in corporate America lagged last year, particularly in three key areas — C-suite representation, talent development and supplier procurement — according to the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility’s 2023 Corporate Inclusion Index. While Hispanics make up 18% of the U.S. workforce, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they are overrepresented in nonexempt positions, which represent 73% of the Hispanic workforce according to HACR’s research. Nonexempt positions often offer fewer benefits, limited autonomy and fewer advancement opportunities, which can stifle the ability of Hispanic workers to advance within companies. ″There’s no precise way to define success in the case of these things,” said Lisette Garcia, HACR chief research officer. “It’s more about ensuring that people feel engaged and committed and valued and that their voice matters, but that’s where benchmarking and doing these surveys matter.” The corporate advocacy group’s annual report, which measures Hispanic inclusion in employment, procurement, governance and philanthropy, was provided exclusively to CNBC ahead of its wider release. It includes data from 92 companies — many within the Fortune 500 — collected between January and April. A key finding from HACR: The lack of representation typically begins right at the start of the pipeline. While all companies that participated in the survey reported offering internship programs, only 13% of interns in 2022 identified as Hispanic. Garcia clarified that number may in reality be higher since demographic data collection around interns isn’t always conducted. While the vast majority of companies say they prioritize “mentorship” and “succession planning initiatives,” at 91% and 97% of respondents, respectively, almost one-third of companies said they do not have clearly defined goals or metrics to evaluate the success of internal talent development and program success. “One way of combatting issues related to Hispanic inclusion in corporate America is investments in internship programs as a way of attracting new employees,” HACR noted in its report. Hispanic representation on corporate boards was even more troubling, according to the findings. Just 7% of board seats at respondent companies were held by Hispanics according to HACR, and only 2% of seats were held by Latinas. Almost half the companies surveyed had no Hispanic board directors. As for supplier diversity, HACR found fewer than 1% of companies supplying to survey respondents were Hispanic in 2022, and just slightly more than 1% of total spend was with Hispanic-owned businesses. Garcia also noted those results amount to best estimates, not perfect numbers, since companies aren’t required to collect demographic information for their supplier pool. She also shared in her research that the companies collecting this data and sharing their results are often those committed to leading the charge. “Companies who really understand the value of this work for their business bottom line are going to be the ones that keep moving forward,” she said. “The sheer numbers of population growth and buying power tell us that companies aren’t going to really have a choice.” While Hispanic inclusion lagged, HACR noted survey participation was up 12%, offering hope for future improvement. “In spite of everything that’s happening in society at large with attacks on DEI work and attacks on marginalized people in the United States, we’re seeing companies be interested in benchmarking,” said Garcia. “There’s this renewed interest in saying, ‘Hey, where am I? What do I need to do to get better,’ and for me, that’s all I need to hear.” Disclosure: CNBC’s parent company Comcast is among the companies that participated in HACR’s annual survey.",CNBC
Lillian Rizzo,"For U.S. investors seeking an edge in European soccer, the cheaper the better","For U.S. investors looking to score an investment in a European soccer club, some of the focus is shifting toward the clubs with lower valuations and typically not in the marquee tier of the sport overseas. Some investors, particularly in the U.S., are shifting toward a so-called multi-club model, or investing in smaller clubs with lower valuations, as they try to take a piece of the international sports market at smaller deal valuations. This comes as deep-pocketed investors — from top U.S. private equity and venture capital firms to global rivals like sovereign wealth funds — have intensified competition. “In terms of private equity and high net worth individuals, soccer is more of a global sport than almost any U.S. sport,” said Charles Baker, co-chair of law firm Sidley’s entertainment, sports and media group. “There are huge populations that can be accessed — in both the regions they play in and the world.” That global nature of soccer fans — and the growing popularity in the U.S. — often translates into higher revenue opportunities from broadcast media rights deals to merchandising. The owners behind clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea FC and Newcastle have seen revenue multiples step up, and in many cases valuations have doubled, PitchBook noted in a report that concluded most clubs would sell at a premium. Deal valuations across the top five European soccer leagues have exploded from more than $70 million in 2018 to roughly $5.2 billion in 2022, according PitchBook. Meanwhile, more than one-third of the clubs in the so-called “Big Five” leagues in Europe are backed by U.S. investors, including private equity and venture capital firms. The spike in 2022 came from a consortium led by U.S. investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital acquiring the English Premier League’s Chelsea for more than $5 billion, as well as RedBird Capital Partners’ takeover of Italy’s AC Milan from Elliott Management for nearly $1.3 billion. “These recent transactions have set a precedent in terms of club valuation but also prompted many owners to consider selling to [private equity],” according to an analyst report from PitchBook. Some firms, like Sixth Street Partners, have found different outlets into taking a stake in European soccer, particularly in Spain’s LaLiga. The firm acquired a stake in the Spanish broadcast rights of FC Barcelona, the former longtime home of superstar Lionel Messi, and also paid about $380 million for a stake in Real Madrid’s stadium operations. The shift is happening as soccer clubs have been looking for fresh capital following the distress stemming from the earlier days of the Covid pandemic. Revenue decreased as coronavirus restrictions kept fans out of the stands and costs rose, which led to an opening for more U.S. investors to take a stake in the increasingly popular global sport. Last month, U.S. investor Fenway Sports Group sold a minority stake in Liverpool FC to Dynasty Equity, in a move to help it pay down debt stemming from the pandemic and costs from upgrading the team’s home field and buying high-profile players. Various English Premier League clubs have been reportedly open to discussions with buyers, including recently Sheffield United and Manchester United. This has led some U.S. investors to find creative ways into the European sports market. Lower tier leagues like England’s Championship League and League One are attractive plays at smaller valuations, and each have teams open to buyers and investors, noted Neil Barlow, an attorney at Clifford Chance. “One thing to be mindful of is relegation — it’s taken PE firms and other financial buyers a bit of time to get more comfortable with that. At the same time, they understand the upside of promotion,” said Baker. In soccer, teams face relegation to lower leagues if they have a disappointing season. Irwin Raij, also co-chair of law firm Sidley’s entertainment, sports and media group, said the firm has seen plenty of investors with business plans to take lower tier teams to a higher level through investment. “It sounds easier than it is to implement. We’ve seen interest from a broad variety of investors in that space,” Raij said. There’s also rising interest in other teams across Europe, letting U.S. middle-market investors snap up multiple teams and move toward a so-called “multi-club” model. Valuations across these teams are typically in line with each other. It also allows for a model in which players can be transferred throughout the various clubs owned by the same investor, building up their talent and potentially being sold to a higher league — similar to the minor leagues in the U.S. Through this method, investors “can find synergies between comparable clubs,” either on the same continent or across the globe, while also leveraging governance, technology and data sharing between the clubs, Barlow said. “It’s a strategy a lot of other U.S.-based investors are circling around deploying,” Barlow said. City Football Club is a multi-club outfit that includes Abu Dhabi United Group as its majority investor. It’s also backed by U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake, and Chinese investors hold a small stake. City Football Club owns the Premier League’s powerhouse and recent champion Manchester City, as well as Major League Soccer’s New York City Football Club and Australia’s Melbourne City. But as larger private equity firms chase the top teams, middle-market firms are looking to raise funds to chase the multi-club strategy, Barlow noted. One U.S. firm that has been using this strategy is 777 Partners. The Florida-based company recently agreed to buy a majority stake in the Premier League’s Everton for a reported $685 million, after building its portfolio with other European soccer clubs in the past few years. In 2018, the firm took a stake in the Spain’s Sevilla FC, and followed suit with investments in clubs in various countries from Genoa C.F.C. in Italy and Red Star FC in France to clubs in Brazil and Australia.

Michael Wayland,UAW Mack Trucks union members to join striking Detroit autoworkers on picket lines after voting down tentative deal,"In this article DETROIT – About 3,900 United Auto Workers members with Mack Trucks will go on strike Monday after a majority of members rejected a tentative agreement reached last week by the union and company. The tentative agreement was voted down by 73% of UAW members who voted, the union said Sunday night. Workers at facilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Florida will strike starting at 7 a.m. Monday, UAW announced online. The Mack Trucks workers will add to tens of thousands of other striking UAW members, most notably more than 25,000 employees with General Motors , Ford Motor and Stellantis . The union launched targeted strikes at select facilities against the Detroit automakers beginning Sept. 15. The union’s since expanded the strikes at each of the automakers. The Mack Trucks deal was viewed as a potential test of the willingness of workers to ratify a deal that didn’t meet raised expectations set by UAW President Shawn Fain for record contracts for hourly pay increases, equal pay for equal work, inflation protection and shorter work weeks. The tentative deal with Volvo Group -owned Mack Trucks fell significantly short of what the union is demanding in negotiations currently being held with the Detroit automakers, leading some workers last week to tell CNBC that they would vote against the deal. One Mack Trucks worker descried the deal as “disgraceful” and an “insult” compared to their expectations and what’s currently being negotiated by UAW international leaders with the Detroit automakers, also known as the Big Three. “We are low man on totem pole, and we are getting no backing from international,” said a more than 10-year material technician on Friday. “They are just pushing this [tentative agreement] through so they don’t have to deal with us while the Big Three are negotiating.” While Mack Trucks is a separate company and a different part of the union than the section that covers members with the Detroit automakers, some workers were expecting that they would receive similar increases and benefits as their union brethren at the Detroit automakers. The Mack Trucks tentative agreement varies by location and job but for many workers, it includes a roughly 19% wage increase over the five-year deal, including 10% upon ratification; $3,500 ratification bonuses; increased 401(k) company payments; and other benefits. It does not include the elimination of wage tiers (it only has a one-year reduction that would bring the steps to five years); re-instatement of traditional pensions; cost-of-living adjustments to battle inflation; or shorter work weeks. Demands by UAW negotiators with the Detroit automakers have included 40% pay increase, inflation protection in the form of cost-of-living allowances (COLA), work/life balance and other bonuses and benefits. Fain, who has publicly laid out the demands for Detroit autoworkers, said COLA, job security, wage progression and a host of other topics as outstanding issues in the talks with Mack Trucks. “The members have spoken, and as the highest authority in our union, they have the final word,” Fain said Sunday in a message released by the union. He said the union “remains committed to exploring all options for reaching an agreement, but clearly we are not there yet.” Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy said the company is “surprised and disappointed that the UAW has chosen to strike, which we feel is unnecessary.” “We are committed to the collective bargaining process, and remain confident that we will be able to arrive at an agreement that delivers competitive wages and benefits for our employees and their families, while safeguarding our future as a competitive company and stable long-term employer. We look forward to returning to negotiations as soon as possible,” he said Sunday night in a release.",CNBC
Stefan Sykes,U.S. drinkers are flocking to Mexican brands — here’s what’s driving growth,"People in the U.S. are drinking less alcohol than they used to, but when they do indulge, they’re more likely than ever to opt for a beverage originating from Mexico. The U.S. is the largest market for Mexico’s agave-based spirits and its top beers. In recent years, Mexican brands have begun to dominate the U.S. alcoholic beverages industry as drinkers develop a thirst for premium-priced products with authentic backstories. Last year, Mexico’s native agave-based spirits tequila and mezcal overtook American whiskey to become the second-fastest growing spirits category by revenue and volume within the U.S., according to analysis by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, an industry trade association. In 2022 alone, nearly 30 million 9 liter cases of tequila and mezcal were sold in the U.S. Experts say the segment is poised to pass vodka in 2023 to become the country’s fastest-growing spirits category in terms of volume. Lea este artículo en español aquí. “Tequila has been such a national treasure here in Mexico,” said Guilherme Espagnoli Martins, global brand director of Diageo-owned Don Julio Tequila. “Now, it’s breaking through geographies and flying to other countries as well.” “It’s putting Mexico on the map,” he said. The rise of Mexican alcoholic beverages into the mainstream U.S., more than 20 years in the making, is the result of authentic, savvy marketing aimed at making Mexican brands palatable to consumers outside of the brands’ home country, while still resonating with their traditional market. Other factors driving the higher sales include consumers’ increasing willingness to spend more on higher-quality products across wine, spirits and beer. The growth of tequila and mezcal in particular has been propelled by sales of premium or high-end brands such as Casamigos and Don Julio, which are priced higher at retail and are produced with 100% agave, without flavoring or additives. The George Clooney-founded Casamigos, which came into the market a decade ago and paved the way for other celebrity-owned premium tequilas, is so far this year’s top-selling tequila across the alcohol e-commerce site Drizly, a Drizly spokesperson told CNBC. Don Julio was the second. Since 2003, the tequila and mezcal category in the U.S. overall grew 273% in volumes, or at an average rate of 7.2% per year, while premium agave-based spirits skyrocketed 1,522%, DISCUS found. All the products driving the tequila boom originate from Mexico. While some brands such as Casamigos are based outside the country, the spirit legally has to be produced there. Don Julio, a more than 80-year-old Mexican business now owned by British spirits giant Diageo, is rebranding and finding fresh success amid the new wave of appreciation for tequila. Martins said Don Julio’s smooth taste, versatility and perception as a purer, cleaner spirit has boosted the product. This year-end, the brand saw double-digit growth in global sales and is up 20% in 2023 compared to last year, a spokesperson told CNBC. Last month, it debuted a new look and promotional film as it seeks to replicate the success it has had in the U.S. overseas. “As we take this brand global, there is a huge responsibility for us to put modern Mexico on the world stage,” Martins said of the campaign. It’s not just tequila and mezcal — Mexican beer is booming, too. Mexican beer imports into the U.S. are up 10.6% in 2023, according to alcohol research firm Bump Williams Consulting. Earlier this year, Mexico’s Modelo Especial became the best-selling beer in the U.S., dethroning Bud Light, which held the top spot since 2001. “Once [the beer’s owner] Constellation got their hands on Modelo, the company was really able to step up marketing investment and drive tremendous growth,” said TD Cowen analyst Vivien Azer. Constellation Brands acquired Modelo in 2013 following an antitrust deal that blocked rival Anheuser-Busch InBev from buying the brand. Its rise to the top started before the conservative boycott against AB InBev’s Bud Light that began this spring. Modelo, along with Constellation’s Corona Extra, has benefited from the U.S.′ steadily growing Hispanic population, Azer said. But the company sought growth outside of Hispanic drinkers as well. “It was a deliberate strategy by Constellation to diversify away from Hispanic consumers and toward a wider market,” said Azer. A spokesperson for Constellation told CNBC that Mexican beer sales grew as Hispanic culture gained a stronger foothold around the world. “The popularity of Mexican beers can in part be tied to the Hispanic population growth and influence on culture,” the spokesperson said. “Younger generations are increasingly bicultural and Latin culture has had a huge impact on the mainstream.” Constellation on Thursday reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates, driven by the surge in demand for its Mexican beer brands. The companies behind the lagers’ growth also attributed their success to a simple factor: taste. Mexican beers are “very easy to drink,” said Jonnie Cahill, chief marketing officer at Heineken USA, which distributes the Mexican beers Dos Equis and Tecate. Cahill said that not only are Mexican beers riding on the tailwinds of changing consumer preferences toward lighter-tasting, more expensive imported lagers, but also the category has been lifted by “authentic” marketing, such as the pairing of lime and beer, which is played up in advertisements, at bars and for holidays such as Cinco de Mayo. “We focus on authentic Mexican flavors whenever we innovate and we avoid randomness, because that’s the opportunism that people often reject,” Cahill said of Heineken’s Dos Equis brand, which peaked in the mid-2000s with its iconic The Most Interesting Man in the World campaign. It’s a competitive space, admitted Cahill. Sales for Dos Equis have declined in recent years. In the week ending Sept. 9, Dos Equis retail sales off premise were down 1.7%, while Modelo and Corona were up 10.6% and 3.3% respectively, according to Bump Williams Consulting. Cahill said the brand is trying to ramp up distribution across the U.S. in hopes of competing with rivals. Eduardo “Lalo” González grew up in the agave fields where his grandfather Don Julio began a tequila empire that would reach all parts of the world. “I always had this dream and this idea of continuing this legacy of my family,” said González. “Believe it or not, there’s a lack of Mexican ownership in tequila brands.” Diageo acquired Don Julio in 2015. In 2020, González launched LALO Tequila, a blanco tequila free of flavors or additives and made with 100% agave distilled in González’s home region of Jalisco, just one of five Mexican states where tequila can be legally produced. “It’s all about embracing family and embracing legacy and embracing traditions,” González said, as the brand begins to find its footing in the U.S. “We’re building our own story by honoring our ancestors, and also by bringing people into our culture.” What’s next for the category? Tequila and mezcal prices may increase as American demand continues to surge and the agave plant suffers some shortages, said González. Agave takes about seven years to grow and can only be planted in certain Mexican regions. González said more farmers have begun harvesting the succulent as the industry plants the seeds for similar growth in overseas markets.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Novavax’s updated Covid vaccine can still catch up to Pfizer, Moderna shots","In this article Americans can finally get their hands on Novavax ’s newest Covid vaccine after U.S. regulators greenlighted the shot this week. The vaccine’s arrival comes nearly three weeks after new jabs from Pfizer and Moderna reached the public, and after more than 4 million patients rolled up their sleeves to get a shot in September. But Wall Street analysts aren’t worried about that delay. They said Novavax appears well positioned to catch up and compete this fall with the other companies in the U.S. Covid vaccine market, particularly after logistical issues hampered the rollout of the other shots and a Food and Drug Administration label that allows for wide accessibility to Novavax’s jab, among other factors. “I’m really not concerned about the timeline or lag relative to the other shots,” B. Riley Securities analyst Mayank Mamtani told CNBC. He added that regulators cleared Novavax’s new shot only slightly later than what the company had estimated, which was late in the third quarter. That’s good news for Novavax, which is working to strengthen its financial position after raising doubts about its ability to stay in business at the beginning of the year. The biotech company is banking on sales of its updated Covid vaccine — its only commercially available product — and a broad cost-cutting push to help it stay afloat.  Public health officials see Novavax’s vaccine as a valuable alternative for people who don’t want to take messenger RNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna, which teach cells how to make proteins that trigger an immune response against Covid. Novavax’s shot fends off the virus with protein-based technology, a decades-old method used in routine vaccinations against hepatitis B and shingles. Silvia Taylor, Novavax’s chief corporate affairs and advocacy officer, told CNBC that the company has collected data showing that 25% to 30% of people prefer a protein-based vaccine. “We look forward to meeting this demand and more in the wake of new variants and rising COVID cases,” Taylor said in a statement. Shares of Novavax jumped more than 10% on Tuesday after the FDA cleared its new shot. But the company’s stock is still down more than 25% year to date after shedding more than 90% of its value last year. The FDA authorized Novavax’s updated vaccine — which targets the omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 — for emergency use in people ages 12 and older. Patients previously vaccinated with an older Covid vaccine are eligible to receive one dose of Novavax’s new jab, while unvaccinated people can receive two doses, according to the authorization. The FDA similarly approved the new shots from Pfizer and Moderna for people ages 12 and older, but the agency also authorized those vaccines for emergency use in children ages 6 months through 11 years old. Still, Mamtani said the authorization label for Novavax’s new vaccine is “broad and without any notable restrictions for the first time,” which will likely make the shot as widely accessible to teens and adults as the new mRNA jabs. That puts Novavax on more of a level playing field with Pfizer and Moderna this fall, even as a late entrant to the game. The label for Novavax’s last Covid booster was far more restrictive. Last year, the FDA authorized it as a first booster dose for people ages 18 and older who couldn’t receive a new mRNA shot for accessibility or clinical reasons. That “basically disqualified a lot of people” from getting it last fall, according to Mamtani.  “Finally, after three years, Novavax has a label that puts its vaccine at parity with the mRNA shots,” Mamtani said. “I think the most powerful words on that label was that people can get it regardless of their previous Covid vaccination history.”  Novavax’s vaccine is entering the market after Pfizer and Moderna had a bumpy start to the rollout of their shots. Insurance and supply-related issues left many Americans unable to find or access the new mRNA vaccines for free, which may give Novavax an opportunity to catch up and get more people to take its shot.  “We know that a lot of people have tried to get an mRNA vaccine, but they aren’t able to because of logistical challenges of access and distribution,” Jefferies analyst Roger Song told CNBC. “So, that’s one reason why the two or three weeks delay won’t necessarily be a hurdle for Novavax.”  There’s no way of knowing whether the rollout of Novavax’s new shot will see similar logistical snags or if it will have a smoother launch. The federal government shifted Covid vaccine distribution and coverage to the private market for the first time this fall. That has proved to be a tricky transition for the U.S. health-care system.  However, health-care providers and pharmacies have signaled that they are ironing out logistical issues and will be better equipped to handle them in the future. Last week, a group of insurers told the Biden administration they were “largely, if not completely,” done with fixing delays in insurance coverage for the new Covid shots. Those delays had resulted in some patients getting charged up to $190 for a shot at pharmacies. “Should further issues arise, we stand ready to swiftly implement system improvements,” the insurers said in a letter.  Some pharmacies, like Walgreens , also appear to be resolving supply disruptions, which left many stores without any new Covid shots for patients to receive. What’s more, Novavax’s new shot might actually be arriving at just the right time: a month before Covid vaccine demand is expected to peak in the U.S. this fall and winter.  Jefferies’ Song said the peak could follow a similar pattern as last season when most Covid boosters were administered in November. That’s partly because there is “less urgency” among Americans when it comes to Covid shots compared to early on in the pandemic, which could cause them to get vaccinated later rather than earlier. “During the first season of Covid, everyone rushed to get vaccinations because it was really an emergency state. But now people have a mindset where they’re saying, ‘OK, I will wait and see how bad Covid really gets,’” Song said. By November, Novavax’s new shot will likely be as widely available as shots from Pfizer and Moderna at pharmacies, doctor’s offices and other vaccine distribution sites.  But the biggest uncertainty this fall for all three companies is how many Americans will decide to get another Covid vaccine, Song said. Last year’s uptake was already feeble: Only about 17% of the U.S. population — around 56 million people — received last year’s boosters, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We don’t know how big the overall pie will be because we’ve never been in a commercial market for Covid vaccines,” he told CNBC. “This fall will set a new benchmark for the entire Covid vaccine space.”",CNBC
Michael Wayland,UAW Mack Trucks workers to vote on deal amid heightened expectations,"In this article DETROIT — United Auto Workers members with Volvo Group -owned Mack Trucks will vote this weekend on a tentative agreement that falls significantly short of what the union is demanding in negotiations currently being held with Detroit automakers. The Sunday vote by roughly 3,900 union members could test the willingness of workers to ratify a lesser deal compared to raised expectations set by UAW President Shawn Fain for hourly pay increases, equal pay for equal work, inflation protection and, potentially, shorter work weeks. While Mack Trucks is a separate company and a different part of the union than the section that covers members with General Motors , Ford Motor and Stellantis , some workers were expecting that they would receive similar increases and benefits as their union brethren at the Detroit automakers. “In my opinion, the master contract is not horrid. It’s not a bad contract, but it’s nowhere near what we were expecting,” a 12-year Mack Truck worker at the company’s Lehigh Valley Operations in Pennsylvania told CNBC. The worker and several other UAW members with Mack Trucks who asked not to be identified due to fear of retribution from the union or company said they plan to vote against the deal. Their reasons included the tentative agreement not meeting expectations, the length of the deal being a year longer than before and the pay increases and bonuses not being enough to offset inflation or reward them for working through the Covid-19 pandemic. “When we were going in, we were following basically like the automakers,” the worker said. “They’ve changed some things for the better but, in my opinion, not enough.” The Mack Trucks tentative agreement varies by location and job but for many workers, it includes a roughly 19% wage increase over the five-year deal, including 10% upon ratification; $3,500 ratification bonuses; increased 401(k) company payments; and other benefits. It does not include the elimination of wage tiers (it only has a one-year reduction that would bring the steps to five years); re-instatement of traditional pensions; cost-of-living adjustments to battle inflation; or shorter work weeks. The Mack Trucks tentative agreement isn’t a bad deal, but it’s not close to the 40% pay increase, inflation protection, work/life balance and other bonuses and benefits Fain has set as the standard for negotiations with the Detroit automakers. For the Detroit automakers, pay tiers also have been at least cut in half from eight years — a time frame Fain, a former auto worker, said Friday was “not acceptable.” Mack Trucks and UAW announced the tentative agreement early Monday, followed by releasing “highlights” of the deal later in the week to members. Neither UAW nor Mack Trucks have publicly released the tentative contract ahead of employee meetings to detail the agreement and voting this weekend.  Another Mack Trucks worker descried the deal as “disgraceful” and an “insult” compared to their expectations and what’s currently being negotiated by UAW international leaders with the Detroit automakers, also known as the Big Three. “We are low man on totem pole, and we are getting no backing from international,” said a more than 10-year material technician. “They are just pushing this [tentative agreement] through so they don’t have to deal with us while the Big Three are negotiating.” UAW declined to comment on the comparison in contracts between Mack Trucks and the Detroit automakers. Mack Trucks President Stephen Roy, in a Monday statement, said the tentative agreement “would deliver significantly increased wages and continue first-class benefits for Mack employees and their families,” while keeping the company competitive. Another veteran worker at Mack Truck’s Lehigh Valley Operations in Pennsylvania said they were not expecting the same raises and benefits as what’s being negotiated with the Detroit automakers, but they were looking for more than what’s in the current tentative agreement. “We pay dues just like the Big Three,” said the roughly 20-year Mack Trucks employee who has worked several positions with the company. “We should get at least the same type of negotiation options.” One of the “options” mentioned by Mack Truck workers was conducting target strikes like what’s happening at the Detroit automakers to fight for additional wages and benefits, specifically, the reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments to combat inflation. “My honest opinion, I thought we were going out on strike because there’s no COLA in it,” the worker said. So, in five years, we’re going to be right back in the same hole.” Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who specializes in labor issues, said it’s important to note that Mack Trucks is not in the same position as the Detroit automakers. However, inflated expectations from union members can be a problem. “The UAW can be a victim of its own success,” he said. “They get a good deal here and everybody’s going to say we want the same thing … but they operate in different industries or different segments of the larger industry that have different financial considerations, and I think that’s just what you’re seeing here.”",CNBC
Alex Sherman,The NBA can shift the balance of power in media with its next rights deal,"In this article The National Basketball Association’s upcoming decision on which companies will acquire the TV and streaming rights for its live games could transform the entire media industry. Based on preliminary discussions between media executives and league officials, Comcast ’s NBCUniversal, Google ’s YouTube TV, Amazon , Apple and even Netflix may challenge or join the incumbents as rights holders, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Spokespeople at NBCUniversal, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and Netflix declined to comment. Every media rights renewal for the NBA is an important event because it only happens about once a decade. The last rights deal was announced in 2014. The NBA’s current rights deal ends after the 2024-25 season. All expressions of interest between media partners and the NBA have been preliminary because league officials can’t officially negotiate with interested partners until April, when the league’s exclusive negotiating window with incumbent media rights partners Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery ends. But with the National Football League’s media rights locked up until 2033, the NBA has a unique opportunity to play media kingmaker. Live sports have continuously increased in value for decades as advertisers clamor for live events where commercials can’t be skipped. The NBA will likely get a significant increase on its new media deal. Former ESPN head John Skipper predicted earlier this year the league could get between 200% and 350% more in its new agreement. “Our next set of media deals will help shape the future of our league and how fans consume NBA basketball for years to come,” an NBA spokesperson said. Netflix’s potential interest in the NBA could be industry-shaking. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos has repeatedly said Netflix hasn’t encountered a viable path to carrying live sports that would appeal to its shareholders. “We’ve not seen a profit path to renting big sports,” he said in December. But Sarandos has recently softened his stance from disinterest in the NBA to potential interest, according to people familiar with the matter. What that means is still unknown. It’s unlikely the NBA would hand over its largest package of streaming games to a provider that’s never had experience with live sports, said the people. Netflix has contemplated buying sports rights before. The world’s largest streamer unsuccessfully bid for live Formula 1 racing rights last year. But the biggest change for Netflix is the company’s push to add customers to its advertising-supported tier, which launched in November. About 5 million subscribers had signed up for its ad tier, which costs $6.99 per month, Netflix announced in May. Netflix said earlier this year it makes more money off subscribers who select the cheaper ad-supported tier than its $15.49 standard tier, which doesn’t include advertising. The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for the advertising tier would likely rise even more if Netflix added a package of NBA games, which would command premium-priced ad rates unlike anything currently on Netflix’s service. Disney and Amazon have also adjusted their streaming offerings to account for the media industry’s recent revelation that there’s enough digital advertising demand to push ARPU just as high as or even higher than their higher-priced no-ad subscription products. Disney is increasing its ad-free pricing on Disney+ by 27% later this month while keeping the price of ad-supported Disney+ stagnant. Amazon plans to inject commercials into its previously ad-free Prime Video in 2024. The NBA would be a particularly valuable addition to an ad-supported streaming service because its season runs from October to June, including playoffs. That’s an effective churn reducer for fans, who won’t be able to binge-watch a season of live games like they do with on-demand entertainment series. Netflix sells an ad-supported plan in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. That global reach is appealing for the NBA, which features an assortment of international stars, including Slovenian Luka Dončić of the Dallas Mavericks, Serbian Nikola Jokić of the NBA champion Denver Nuggets and French rookie Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs. It’s also possible the league could decide to maximize its domestic reach by striking a new deal with NBCUniversal, which has both a broadcast network and a streaming service, Peacock, that could serve as homes for live games. NBC has a nostalgic relationship with fans, dating back to the Michael Jordan-dominated days of the 1990s’ “The NBA on NBC.” CNBC first reported NBCUniversal’s interest in again airing NBA games earlier this year. Still, Peacock has just 24 million subscribers, fewer than Disney’s ESPN+ or Warner Bros. Discovery’s Max, and is only available within the U.S. Broadening reach is important to league officials, who are intrigued by Google’s YouTube TV as a potential streaming partner, according to people familiar with the matter. YouTube TV struck a deal to be the NFL’s exclusive “Sunday Ticket” provider earlier this year. NBA executives have been impressed with the production quality and user experience, said the people. While YouTube TV, a subscription bundle of linear channels a la traditional pay TV, is only available in the U.S., the league already has an existing global partnership with YouTube that includes providing highlights, game recaps, full-length games and produced segments. YouTube has more than 2.7 billion global monthly active users and can market the sport to a younger audience than Amazon or Apple can do with their subscription services. The average age of an NBA viewer is 49, and 26% of viewers are under 35, according to Nielsen. Between Amazon and Apple, league officials are currently more comfortable with choosing Amazon as a potential streaming partner, according to people familiar with the matter. Amazon has proven to the NBA it is serious about making a large investment in live sports, including its $1 billion per year contract to carry “Thursday Night Football.” While Apple has deals to carry Major League Soccer and “Friday Night Baseball” for Major League Baseball, the NBA isn’t convinced Apple will prioritize marketing the league’s games in the same way other streaming services might. Apple TV+ has never disclosed how many subscribers it has. Apple will have a chance to make its pitch directly to the league if and when the NBA begins discussions with other partners after its exclusive window with incumbents expires. It’s possible Apple or Netflix could get a smaller package of games from the NBA as a test run for a future larger partnership. Still, that would run counter to the league’s preference to limit the number of packages it wishes to dole out. The NBA will have to balance demand against restricting supply to maximize the price for rights. The league probably wants to have just two or three media partners to serve broadcast, cable and streaming eyeballs, according to people familiar with the matter. Spreading packages between too many media partners will potentially confuse and annoy consumers, who will need to sign up for multiple services and then find where games are streaming on a given day. Currently, an NBA game could appear on Disney’s ESPN or ABC, Warner Bros. Discovery’s TNT, NBA TV, NBA League Pass or a regional sports network. Add new streaming services to the mix, and consumers could easily become overwhelmed with options. Likewise, if the NBA doesn’t reach a new deal with either ESPN or TNT and goes in another direction, it may accelerate the deterioration of the cable bundle — as live sports is one of the last pillars keeping it alive. The league hopes to mitigate some of this complexity by marketing its NBA app and NBA.com as digital “front doors” to discover content, according to people familiar with the matter. The league hopes to get fans in the habit of first opening the app or NBA.com before being directly ported to a streaming service that’s broadcasting the game or potentially staying and watching games in-app, depending on partnership arrangements. This is a similar concept to what ESPN has considered, as CNBC reported earlier this year. Disclosure: Comcast-owned NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.

Hugh Son,"This trade is where investors are hiding out amid choppy markets, Goldman says","Investors have piled into short-term U.S. government bonds in a bid to wait out the upheaval caused by a blowout in longer-term yields, according to a Goldman Sachs executive. An auction this week of 52-week Treasury bills at a 5.19% rate was 3.2 times oversubscribed, its highest demand of the year, said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing at Goldman Sachs asset and wealth management. “They’re saying, ‘I’m now being afforded a lot more yield in the very front end of the curve in government paper’,” Rosner told CNBC in a phone interview, referring to 1-year T-bills. “That is really where you’re seeing investors flock.” The trade is a key way that institutions and wealthy investors are adjusting to the surge in long-term interest rates that have roiled markets lately. The 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing for weeks, reaching a 16-year high of 4.89% Friday after the September jobs report showed that employers were still hiring aggressively. Investors poured more than $1 trillion into new T-bills last quarter, according to Bloomberg. The playbook, according to Rosner, takes advantage of the presumption that interest rates will be higher for longer than markets had expected earlier this year. If that sentiment holds true, longer-duration Treasuries like the 10-year should offer better yields next year as the yield curve steepens, she said. “You get to collect a 5% coupon for the next year,” she said. “Then, in a year, you may have opportunities [in longer-duration Treasuries] at greater than 5% in government securities or potentially in [corporate bonds] that are now properly priced. “You could then get a double-digit yield, but be confident about valuation, unlike now,” she added. While 10-year Treasuries have crashed in recent weeks, other fixed income instruments including investment-grade and high-yield bonds haven’t fully reflected the change in rate assumptions, according to Rosner. That makes them a bad deal for the moment, but could create opportunities down the road. The upheaval that’s punished holders of longer-dated Treasuries in recent weeks has professional managers reducing the average duration of their portfolios, according to Ben Emons, head of fixed income at NewEdge Wealth.  “Treasury bills are in high demand,” he said. “Anyone out there who needs to manage duration in their portfolio, you do that with the 1-year T bill. That’s what BlackRock is doing, it’s what I’m doing.”",CNBC
Michael Wayland,UAW will not expand strikes at Detroit automakers after last-minute GM proposal,"In this article DETROIT – The United Auto Workers will not expand strikes against the Detroit automakers this week amid progress in the talks, including General Motors agreeing to include battery cell workers under the company’s national agreement. This is the first week since targeted strikes by the UAW started on Sept. 15 that the union will not expand the work stoppages at GM, Ford Motor or Chrysler-parent Stellantis . Fain said the union was planning to shut down GM’s Arlington Assembly plant that produces highly profitable full-size SUVs until a last-minute proposal by the company to place the automaker’s battery cell workers under its national agreement. “Just that threat has provided a transformative win,” Fain, wearing an “EAT THE RICH” T-shirt, said during an online broadcast Friday. “We’ve been told for months that this is impossible ... and now we’ve called their bluff. What this will mean for our membership cannot be understated.” GM declined to immediately comment on the battery cell workers, citing the ongoing negotiations: “Our goal remains to reach an agreement that rewards our employees and allows GM to be successful into the future.” GM, with its battery plant in Ohio, is the only Detroit automaker with a joint venture battery plant in operation and unionized in the U.S. The automaker has announced plans for two other U.S. battery cell plants with LG Energy Solution as well as one with Samsung SDI. GM’s agreement will put pressure on crosstown rivals Ford and Stellantis to do the same, as the UAW tends to pattern agreements off one another for members to receive “equal pay for equal work,” a longstanding motto of the union. “The plan was to draw down engine and transmission plants and permanently replace them with low-wage battery jobs,” Fain said. “We had a different plan, and our plan is winning at GM. And we expect it to win at Ford and Stellantis as well.” Electric vehicle battery plants have been a major point of contention in this year’s talks between the union and the three Detroit automakers. Each automaker has formed joint ventures with battery makers to manufacture EV batteries in the United States — a move the union has characterized as a plan to shut it out of the new factories, many of which are under construction now. Officially, because they’re owned by joint ventures, the battery plants aren’t covered by the automakers’ agreements with the union. The automakers have said that because of that status, the plants shouldn’t be a factor in contract negotiations with the union. But the UAW has made a “just transition” — meaning, a plan to protect their members as the industry shifts to electric vehicles — a centerpiece of this year’s negotiations, something that has frustrated the automakers. Ford CEO Jim Farley said last week that the UAW is “holding the deal hostage over battery plants.” Ford declined to comment following Fain’s comments Friday, referring to a statement issued earlier in the week that the company remains “open to the possibility of working with the UAW on future battery plants in the U.S., reminding that these are multibillion-dollar investments and have to operate at sustainably competitive levels.” Fain said in his Friday presentation that the union had expected to announce an expansion of the strike against GM. “But today, because of our power, GM has agreed to lay the foundation for a just transition,” he said. UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began, after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts in which all plants simultaneously strike. “I wish I were here to announce a tentative agreement at one or more of these companies, but I do want to be really clear: We are making significant progress,” Fain said. “In just three weeks, we have moved these companies further than anyone thought was possible.” Fain said Ford has offered a 23% raise over the life of the expected four and a half year contract, while GM and Stellantis are at around 20%. Stellantis and Ford also have agreed to reinstate a cost-of-living adjustment that the union lost more than a decade ago, among other enhanced proposals by each of the companies. Stellantis North America Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart, who’s overseeing the negotiations, said the sides “are making progress, but there are gaps that still need to be closed.” “While we still have some work to do, I remain optimistic that our discussions are providing a pathway to a tentative agreement,” Stewart said. Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike. Fain previously said the union would increase the work stoppages, based on progress in the contract negotiations. The strikes began at an assembly plant for each of the Detroit automakers, followed by 38 parts and distribution centers for GM and Stellantis. A week ago, the union expanded strikes to assembly plants for GM in mid-Michigan and Ford in Illinois. “We’ve been very careful about how we escalate this strategy,” Fain said. Vehicle production impacted by the strikes include Ford’s Ranger midsize pickup and Bronco, Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs; Stellantis’ Jeep Wrangler SUV and Gladiator small pickup; and GM’s Chevrolet and GMC midsize pickups, Chevrolet Traverse, Cadillac XT4 and Buick Enclave SUVs and Chevrolet Malibu sedan. The Malibu and XT4 production were idled due to parts shortages caused by the strike. GM this week said the UAW’s strike cost it $200 million in lost production during the third quarter. UAW negotiators have received counter proposals from each of the Detroit automakers during the past week, starting with Stellantis a week ago before Fain’s Friday strike announcement. Ford followed early in the week with a proposal and then GM submitted a counteroffer Wednesday night.",CNBC
Robert Hum,Clorox and MGM Resorts aren’t the only companies dealing with cyberattack damage,"In this article It has been a very eventful couple of weeks for cyberattack-related news. It all kind of started Wednesday of last week when Johnson Controls revealed it had been hit by a cyberattack. The company warned it “experienced disruptions in portions of its internal information technology infrastructure and applications.” And while the financial impact of that attack has not yet been determined, it also cautioned, it “is assessing whether the incident will impact its ability to timely release its fourth quarter and full fiscal year results.” But why is this specific cybersecurity incident of particular interest? Many of Johnson Controls’ customers are federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. That agency is reportedly investigating if any floor plans and security information were exposed as a result of the attack. Then on Wednesday of this week, Clorox gave a shocking earnings warning. The culprit was a significant cybersecurity breach from August — “which caused wide-scale disruption of Clorox’s operations, including order processing delays and significant product outages.” What’s more, while it drastically took down fiscal first-quarter numbers, the company is “in the process of assessing the impact of the cybersecurity attack on fiscal year 2024 and beyond.” Clorox is now expecting a hefty year-over-year sales decline as well as a quarterly loss thanks to the incident. And Thursday night, MGM Resorts revealed that the cyberattack it experienced in September will cost the company about $100 million. It explained that the incident caused “impacts to occupancy due to the availability of bookings through the company’s website and mobile applications.” MGM noted that it was mostly contained to the month of September. It does expect that impact beyond the third quarter should be “minimal” and that, overall, it won’t be material to operations and results for the full year. It also reportedly refused to pay ransom. Unlike its competitor, Caesars paid a $15 million ransom after suffering its own September data breach. It was fortunate, though, that the incident didn’t impact casino or online operations. The company has not yet disclosed a financial impact. While those companies all shed light on developments in recent days, keep in mind some of the other marquee names we’ve seen throughout this year alone that have experienced significant cybersecurity issues as well. It’s been a problem all year for a variety of companies. Campbell Soup didn’t suffer the same ugly fate as Clorox after experiencing a cyberattack that affected one of its facilities over the summer. The food maker said the incident had a minimal impact on operations and was immaterial to financials. Another food maker — Dole — also suffered a cyberattack back in February. It absorbed $10.5 million in costs from the event, which also had a limited impact on operations. Brunswick had to temporarily halt some operations after a June cybersecurity incident. That event cost the company about $85 million and caused second-quarter numbers to be “lower than initial expectations.” It apparently took more than a week for operations to resume. Tempur Sealy and Estee Lauder also had to shut down some IT systems after getting hit by separate cyberattacks in July. Back in March, Sysco disclosed a data breach that happened in January. While customer and employee data were stolen, there was no operational impact. Likewise, miner Freeport-McMoRan suffered a cyberattack in August, but production impact from that was limited.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,Amazon launches first internet satellite prototypes,"In this article Your Amazon order of internet satellite prototypes have shipped. More than four years since the tech giant announced its ambitious plan to invest heavily in building a global satellite internet network, Amazon on Friday saw the first pair of satellites for its Project Kuiper system launch into space. “We’ve done extensive testing here in our lab and have a high degree of confidence in our satellite design, but there’s no substitute for on-orbit testing,” Project Kuiper vice president of technology Rajeev Badyal said in a statement before the launch. Project Kuiper is Amazon’s plan to build a network of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit, to provide high-speed internet access anywhere in the world. The company plans to invest upwards of $10 billion to build Kuiper, and recently broke ground on a $120 million pre-launch processing facility in Florida. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. Called “Protoflight,” Friday’s mission saw United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket carry two satellites – Kuipersat-1 and Kuipersat-2. The rocket launched from ULA’s pad SLC-41 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Amazon twice switched rides for the pair of satellites before finally deciding to go with the immediately available, albeit far overpowered, Atlas V rocket for the Protoflight mission. Amazon originally planned to launch on ABL Space’s RS1 rocket, before delays in RS1′s development moved the satellites to United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket, but delays to Vulcan’s debut moved the satellites to Atlas V. Information about the size and design of the pair of Amazon’s satellites has been scarce – with the company only sharing photos of the shipping containers that delivered the spacecraft to Florida. Even ULA’s details about the launch are limited, with the info provided comparable to when the rocket company flies classified spy satellites for the U.S. government. Last year, Amazon announced the biggest corporate rocket deal in the industry’s history to launch Kuiper satellites, signing launch contracts with ULA, Arianespace, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. As part of that deal, Amazon expects to pay about $7.4 billion for Kuiper launches over the next five years.  It has booked 77 launches – deals that include options for more launches when needed – from that trio of companies to deploy the satellites fast enough to meet regulatory requirements. That massive purchase has come under scrutiny from an Amazon shareholder lawsuit, which alleges the company snubbed SpaceX for valuable satellite launch contracts because of Jeff Bezos’ personal rivalry with Elon Musk. Amazon is playing catch up to SpaceX, which has grown its Starlink satellite internet service to more than 2 million customers. Crucially, SpaceX says it is no longer absorbing the cost of the Starlink antennas it sells with the service, and the more than 5,000 satellites its launched so far now serve consumer, enterprise, and government customers. Earlier this week, Amazon reiterated that its first production Kuiper satellites are on track to launch in the first half of next year – with plans to begin beta testing the network with customers by the end of 2024. Protoflight represents an “end-to-end” test of Kuiper. Amazon will look to verify the prototype satellites can connect to ground antennas and relay that connectivity on to its small customer terminals. This year Amazon revealed a trio of satellite antennas that it plans to sell to Kuiper customers. The company has yet to say what it expects to charge customers for the hardware or service. Earlier field testing of Amazon’s Kuiper antennas saw download speeds of up to 400 Mbps. The company’s main Kuiper facilities are near Seattle – in the Washington cities of Redmond and Kirkland. Amazon has other locations in San Diego, Austin, Texas, New York City and Washington, D.C.",CNBC
Lillian Rizzo,Streaming companies add Spanish-language sports to capture Hispanic viewers,"In this article Streaming platforms are chasing live sports rights to grow their audiences. Increasingly, those audiences are watching in Spanish. Media companies that were already geared toward Hispanic audiences, like TelevisaUnivision and fledgling Canela Media, are bulking up on sports rights and content, while traditional English-language streamers, like NBCUniversal’s Peacock that features Telemundo content, Disney’s ESPN+ and Amazon’s Prime Video are adding simulcast content in Spanish. It’s an effort to diversify viewership and advertising opportunities — and to capitalize on a growing Hispanic streaming audience. “Sports is the pinnacle of premium content that can really help a streaming service,” said Shirin Malkani, co-chair of the sports industry group at law firm Perkins Coie. “If you offer it in Spanish as well as English you may not be doubling your audience but you’re certainly growing it by a large percentage. You are reaching an audience I would argue maybe we haven’t done a great job getting sports content to.” Lea este artículo en español aquí. Hispanic audiences spend nearly nine hours per day consuming media, the majority of which is TV viewership, according to a recent study from Nielsen based on viewership habits from July. The study noted the Hispanic audience has been at “the forefront of cord-cutting,” making it a growing majority of streaming viewership, too. According to the findings, Hispanic viewers spend more than 50% of their time consuming TV through streaming, eclipsing the general population, at nearly 40%. “When I think about the Latino space in particular ... I think it’s an amazing opportunity,” said Eli Velazquez, executive vice president of Telemundo Deportes. “Latinos are pretty much the youngest demographic of all groups by about 13 years, and they’re early adopters of technology. They like to consume content on streaming platforms.” Traditional media companies across the board have been doling out cash for sports as live games still command the highest traditional TV viewership. These companies are also fighting to make their streaming outlets profitable, with sports representing a key subscriber driver. Chief among the value drivers is the rising popularity of soccer in the U.S. Hispanic audiences have long been loyal fans of the sport, which is now gaining steam in American households, helped of late and in part by the arrival of soccer legend Lionel Messi to Major League Soccer’s Inter Miami. Disney’s ESPN+ recently bought the rights to Spanish league LaLiga in both languages for an eight-year period. Leaning into Spanish-language broadcasts allows media companies to not only build up their streaming subscriber bases across various demographics but also opens up new advertising opportunities as ad-based subscription tiers help streaming platforms inch toward profitability. “You can really have a personalized, customized ad load for the Spanish audience, and potentially a different set of advertisers,” Malkani said. Peacock, for one streamer, has already reaped the benefits of its sports offerings. Parent company Comcast touted the growing portfolio — Spanish-language sports, included — during a recent earnings call, noting that the 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup in Qatar helped the company to add 5 million subscribers during the fourth quarter. Streaming made up 30% of total viewership for the 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup, compared to 9% in 2018, according to Telemundo Deportes. Telemundo and Peacock aired the matches in Spanish. Fox holds the English-language rights. Peacock, which has relied heavily on its cheaper, ad-supported offering, had 24 million subscribers as of June 30. Other streamers like Netflix and Disney+ have followed suit with ad-supported subscription options. “I think accessibility and convenience is why we’re leaning more into the streaming product,” Velazquez said, noting he often works with the NBC Sports and Peacock teams to figure out the best streaming strategy for Telemundo’s sports. Peacock also airs Spanish-language broadcasts of some Premier League soccer games as well as the NFL’s “Sunday Night Football.” NFL media rights across languages are sold to U.S. media companies, who are then able to sub-license them to other companies if they don’t have a Spanish-language outlet. Amazon ’s Prime Video, the exclusive home of “Thursday Night Football,” has a Spanish-language simulcast each week, too. “It’s really cool when you have that hardcore fan base that’s learning [the sport] and follows the Thursday night broadcast,” said Rolando Cantu, a former NFL player and analyst on “TNF en Espanol.” “Now we’re part of the Latino culture, and Spanish-speaking people want to engage and consume our broadcast.” Meanwhile, TelevisaUnivision will air the Super Bowl in Spanish in 2024, although it’s unclear if it will be available on both traditional TV and streaming via the company’s Vix platform, which launched in 2022. Paramount ’s broadcast network CBS will air the English-language version of the game on TV and streaming. TelevisaUnivision has been snapping up more sports rights in a bid to expand its audience. Streaming offers an additional platform to air more games. High-profile soccer matches featuring the English Premier League, LaLiga and Serie A often take place at the same time making it difficult to land space on traditional broadcast channels. “Five years ago it was very difficult for us to put anything on screen, because if you’re a soccer fan you know that most soccer happens on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and sometimes Monday. So obviously there’s overlap, right?” said Olek Loewenstein, global president of sports at TelevisaUnivision, adding that it was difficult to cater to various audiences and soccer fan bases. “That’s where streaming comes into play. We can suddenly cater to Argentinians with the Argentinian league and Brazilians with the Brazilian league,” Loewenstein said. TelevisaUnivision recently renewed its deal for the rights to UEFA’s Champions League, paying about $225 million over three years, according to a person familiar with the matter. TelevisaUnivision will also air major soccer events including the Copa America tournament and UEFA’s Euro games next summer. That’s happening on top of the rights to broadcast other soccer leagues, such as Liga MX. “Over the past 10 years, premium rates [for sports rights] have gone up exponentially and non-premium rights have started to disappear,” Loewenstein said. “People are betting on the premium rights out there, because those are the ones that drive either audience or subscriptions.” Loewenstein said the amount being invested in sports now is the most he’s seen joining TelevisaUnivision in 2011. Having more to offer the viewer, he said, has played a key role in Vix’s growth. “I need to be able to convince you to come back the next month or the next week. And I think that’s where sports plays a great role,” Loewenstein said. “For us, sports has been a very key component of the strategy of growth for the base.” Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC, Telemundo and Peacock.",CNBC
Hugh Son,‘Rate shock’: Why borrowing costs for nearly everything are surging,"Violent moves in the bond market this week have hammered investors and renewed fears of a recession, as well as concerns about housing, banks and even the fiscal sustainability of the U.S. government. At the center of the storm is the 10-year Treasury yield , one of the most influential numbers in finance. The yield, which represents borrowing costs for issuers of bonds, has climbed steadily in recent weeks and reached 4.88% on Tuesday, a level last seen just before the 2008 financial crisis. The relentless rise in borrowing costs has blown past forecasters’ predictions and has Wall Street casting about for explanations. While the Federal Reserve has been raising its benchmark rate for 18 months, that hasn’t impacted longer-dated Treasurys like the 10-year until recently as investors believed rate cuts were likely coming in the near term. That began to change in July with signs of economic strength defying expectations for a slowdown. It gained speed in recent weeks as Fed officials remained steadfast that interest rates will remain elevated. Some on Wall Street believe that part of the move is technical in nature, sparked by selling from a country or large institutions. Others are fixated on the spiraling U.S. deficit and political dysfunction. Still others are convinced that the Fed has intentionally caused the surge in yields to slow down a too-hot U.S. economy. “The bond market is telling us that this higher cost of funding is going to be with us for a while,” Bob Michele, global head of fixed income for JPMorgan Chase’s asset management division, said Tuesday in a Zoom interview. “It’s going to stay there because that’s where the Fed wants it. The Fed is slowing you, the consumer, down.” Investors are fixated on the 10-year Treasury yield because of its primacy in global finance. While shorter-duration Treasurys are more directly moved by Fed policy, the 10-year is influenced by the market and reflects expectations for growth and inflation. It’s the rate that matters most to consumers, corporations and governments, influencing trillions of dollars in home and auto loans, corporate and municipal bonds, commercial paper, and currencies. “When the 10-year moves, it affects everything; it’s the most watched benchmark for rates,” said Ben Emons, head of fixed income at NewEdge Wealth. “It impacts anything that’s financing for corporates or people.” The yield’s recent moves have the stock market on a razor’s edge as some of the expected correlations between asset classes have broken down. Stocks have sold off since yields began rising in July, giving up much of the year’s gains, but the typical safe haven of U.S. Treasurys has fared even worse. Longer-dated bonds have lost 46% since a March 2020 peak, according to Bloomberg, a precipitous decline for what’s supposed to be one of the safest investments available. “You have equities falling like it’s a recession, rates climbing like growth has no bounds, gold selling off like inflation is dead,” said Benjamin Dunn, a former hedge fund chief risk officer who now runs consultancy Alpha Theory Advisors. “None of it makes sense.”′ But beyond investors, the impact on most Americans is yet to come, especially if rates continue their climb. That’s because the rise in long-term yields is helping the Fed in its fight against inflation. By tightening financial conditions and lowering asset prices, demand should ease as more Americans cut back on spending or lose their jobs. Credit card borrowing has increased as consumers spend down their excess savings, and delinquencies are at their highest since the Covid pandemic began. “People have to borrow at a much higher rate than they would have a month ago, two months ago, six months ago,” said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector investing at Goldman Sachs asset and wealth management. “Unfortunately, I do think there has to be some pain for the average American now,” she said. Beyond the consumer, that could be felt as employers pull back from what has been a strong economy. Companies that can only issue debt in the high-yield market, which includes many retail employers, will confront sharply higher borrowing costs. Higher rates squeeze the housing industry and push commercial real estate closer to default. “For anyone with debt coming due, this is a rate shock,” said Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group. “Any real estate person who has a loan coming due, any business whose floating rate loan is due, this is tough.” The spike in yields also adds pressure to regional banks holding bonds that have fallen in value, one of the key factors in the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. While analysts don’t expect more banks to collapse, the industry has been seeking to offload assets and has already pulled back on lending. “We are now 100 basis points higher in yield” than in March, Rosner said. “So if banks haven’t fixed their issues since then, the problem is only worse, because rates are only higher.” The rise in the 10-year paused at midweek and picked up Friday, after a much stronger than expected jobs report. The yield climbed 11 basis points to 4.83%. But after piercing through previous resistance levels, many expect that yields can climb higher, since the factors believed to be driving yields are still in place. That has raised fears that the U.S. could face a debt crisis where higher rates and spiraling deficits become entrenched, a concern boosted by the possibility of a government shutdown next month. “There are real concerns of ‘Are we operating at a debt-to-GDP level that is untenable?’” Rosner said. Since the Fed began raising rates last year, there have been two episodes of financial turmoil: the September 2022 collapse in the U.K.’s government bonds and the March U.S. regional banking crisis. Another move higher in the 10-year yield from here would heighten the chances something else breaks and makes recession much more likely, JPMorgan’s Michele said.    “If we get over 5% in the long end, this is legitimately another rate shock,” Michele said. “At that point, you have to keep your eyes open for whatever looks frail.”",CNBC
Lillian Rizzo,Arizona Coyotes local games move to broadcast – the latest big shift in sports TV,"In this article The Arizona Coyotes are skating to a new TV home for local games – showcasing the pressure on cable TV bundles due to cord cutting while broadcast stations look to nab more sports media rights. The NHL team reached a multi-year deal with broadcast station owner E.W. Scripps Co. on Thursday that will see its local games air on over-the-air networks. The NHL season begins Tuesday. The transition to broadcast from cable TV came as Diamond Sports Group, the largest owner of regional sports networks, opted to reject its contract with the Coyotes, according to court papers. Diamond is under bankruptcy protection. A streaming option will be available to fans soon, Scripps and the Coyotes said in a release. The Coyotes’ local games aired on Bally Sports Arizona. However, earlier this year the other professional teams that aired on the network – MLB’s Arizona Diamondbacks, the NBA’s Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury – exited for new TV homes for local games after Diamond rejected their contracts. Terms of the deal between the Coyotes and Scripps were not disclosed Thursday. By rejecting the Coyotes’ contract, Diamond leaves Bally Sports Arizona defunct. The move came after the company said it determined the network “was not profitable,” which is why it rejected the contracts with the other teams, too. The Suns and Mercury reached a similar deal earlier this year with broadcast station owner Gray Television , and are launching a direct-to-consumer streaming option. MLB began running the distribution of the Diamondbacks, as well as the San Diego Padres, another contract rejected by Diamond, earlier this year. Broadcast station owners like Scripps and Gray have been vying for the rights to local games, especially as there may be more that become available due to the Diamond bankruptcy filing, CNBC previously reported. Scripps has already reached deals to carry the NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights – who won the Stanley Cup earlier this year – and a set of WNBA games on its networks. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery is on the way to exiting the regional sports network business – which it inherited in the 2022 merger between Warner Media and Discovery – by the end of the year, which has put another handful of teams up for grabs. Recently, MLB’s Houston Astros and NBA’s Houston Rockets said they acquired AT&T SportsNet Southwest and will relaunch it as Space City Home Network. Even though most consumers watch broadcast networks as part of their cable bundles, the channels are free over-the-air, therefore increasing the teams’ reach and potential viewership. Still, the economics behind the regional sports network business model has long propped up the leagues and teams with high fees. It remains unclear whether deals with broadcast stations can replicate that model. The landscape for local games has dramatically shifted as consumers flee the traditional cable TV bundle and opt for streaming services. Diamond filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, and stopped paying rights fees for some of the teams on its channels. The company has said it’s looking to renegotiate other rights payments deals while under bankruptcy protection. Earlier this week Diamond asked the bankruptcy court to extend the amount of time it has to file a reorganization plan. Diamond said its rights fees to the Coyotes total “tens of millions of dollars annually and increase yearly,” and the company would have owed “a substantial payment” to the team as of Oct. 1, with additional payments in subsequent months, had it not rejected the contract.",CNBC
Laya Neelakandan,Hyundai and Kia to adopt Tesla’s EV charging tech next year,"In this article Hyundai Motor and Kia announced Thursday they will soon adopt Tesla’s electric vehicle charging system, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the United States. Hyundai and Kia join others like Ford and General Motors to integrate the Tesla charging ports, called North American Charging Standard, into their electric vehicles, allowing drivers to use any Tesla charging stations. The charging tech has gained steam in recent months toward becoming a unified charging standard among electric vehicle makers. The South Korean automakers said all new electric vehicles built in 2024 and beyond will incorporate Tesla’s NACS technology to gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. “Our collaboration with Tesla marks another milestone in our commitment to delivering exceptional EV experiences to our customers,” said José Muñoz, president and global COO of Hyundai. “This new alliance will provide Hyundai EV owners confidence in their ability to conveniently charge their vehicles and complements our joint venture company to create a new, high-powered charging network with at least 30,000 stations across North America.” Additionally, owners of current Hyundai and Kia electric vehicle models will be able to access Tesla Superchargers using adapters beginning in the first quarter of 2025. GM CEO Mary Barra has said the automaker expects to see up to $400 million in savings by adoption the NACS technology.",CNBC
Melissa Repko,"Levi Strauss cuts full-year sales forecast again, as inflation takes a toll","In this article Levi Strauss on Thursday cut its full-year sales forecast, as it missed Wall Street’s quarterly revenue expectations and was dragged down by weaker shopping trends at department stores and big-box retailers across the U.S. Shares fell slightly in extended trading. The company’s more cautious outlook comes just three months after it already slashed its full-year profit outlook. It said it now expects net revenues to be flat to up 1% year-over-year compared with a prior range of between 1.5% to 2.5% growth. It said it anticipates adjusted earnings per share to be on the low-end of the previously shared range of $1.10 to $1.20. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Chip Bergh said shoppers – pinched by inflation, rising mortgage rates and gas prices – have bought fewer items from retailers that carry Levi’s apparel. “All the things that are impacting that middle-income consumer are impacting our wholesale business,” he said. Here’s how the denim retailer did in its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 27 was $10 million, or 2 cents per share, compared with $173 million, or 43 cents per share a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were 28 cents. Sales were roughly in line from the $1.52 billion in revenue that the company reported in the year-ago period. Chief Financial and Growth Officer Harmit Singh said on the earnings call that the company took a conservative approach with its outlook, despite seeing continued momentum in its direct-to-consumer business and improving trends in its wholesale business in the first part of the fiscal fourth quarter. Like other retailers, Levi — which also includes Dockers and Beyond Yoga — has coped with a tougher sales backdrop in the U.S. Levi sells its items directly on its website and in its own stores across the globe, but also sells many items through chains retailers like Macy’s, Kohl’s and Target . Those retailers, which buy wholesale items from Levi to carry on their stores and websites, have seen weaker discretionary sales. Bergh said its value-based denim lines, Signature by Levi Strauss and Denizen, have especially been softer. In the third quarter, he said sales of those brands, which are carried by Walmart and Target, were down double digits, he said. “Clearly, that’s an indication that that value consumer is under pressure,” he said. For Levi, direct sales and international sales have been the stronger parts of its business. Like Nike , Levi has tried to control its own destiny by driving more of its overall sales through its own stores and website. In the fiscal third quarter, net revenues from Levi’s direct-to-consumer business increased 14% compared with the year-ago period. E-commerce revenuer shot up by 19% year over year, as the company posted double-digit growth across all of its brands. Direct-to-consumer drove 40% of total net revenues in the fiscal third quarter. It has pledged to get that up to 55% by fiscal 2027. Net revenue from wholesale dropped 8% year-over-year, as sales gains in Asia and Latin America weren’t enough to offset declines in North America and Europe. Along with driving more direct sales, Levi is looking to expand in international markets. On an earnings call with investors, Levi CEO-in-waiting Michelle Gass, tapped to succeed Bergh, said the company is poised for growth because its brand resonates across the world, especially with younger consumers.  The brand is already sold in 110 countries, but she said Levi can gain market share in countries such as Mexico and India. In Mexico, for example, sales have shot up nearly 40% compared with pre-pandemic levels, she said. Levi can capitalize on its fashion reputation by selling more of other types of clothing like chinos, tops and outerwear, along with jeans, she said. Bergh told CNBC unseasonably warm weather in the U.S. and Europe likely played a role in worse wholesale trends, too. Most of the Levi apparel that Walmart , J.C.Penney, Macy’s and others carry are jeans, he said. “It’s hard to sell blue jeans when it’s 110 degrees outside,” he said on a call with CNBC. At its own stores, he said, Levi can has a wider range of clothing, such as tank tops, skirts and shorts it can swap out based on customer trends — and the temperature. Plus, he said, it draws shoppers who have higher incomes and are willing to pay more for fashion-forward premium denim. “We know that $100,000 and up consumer is a little bit less impacted by what’s happening from a macro [economic] standpoint,” he said. “We’re all being affected, to be clear, but they’ve got a little bit more income to spend and the people that are coming into our stores they want to buy Levi’s.” Levi made an unusual move in recent months: Cutting prices of about half a dozen more price-sensitive items sold by other retailers to try to jumpstart sales. Bergh said in July that Levi would lower the price of select pairs of jeans from $79.50 to $69.50. That price is still higher than its pre-pandemic price of $59.50, Bergh said. Retailers had control over when to cut those prices, but some took effect in early August — the final month of the third quarter, Bergh said. “As retailers have reflected price reductions to the consumer on those particular fits, the trends have improved,” he said. He said the company is “cautiously optimistic” that as new styles debut and the holiday season approaches, customers may be more willing to open their wallets. One factor that could help Levi this holiday season? Cleaner inventories across the retail industry, Bergh said. In the year-ago period, many retailers’ biggest holiday wish was to clear through a glut of unsold merchandise. That led to lots of deep discounts and less profitable sales. Bergh said he expects a “slightly less promotional environment than a year ago.” “We’re not gonna lead aggressive promotions, but we will be competitive,” he said. Shares of Levi have fallen about 14% so far this year, underperforming the 11% gains of the S&P 500. The company’s stock closed on Thursday at $13.21, down nearly 2%.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,Washington reusable rocket startup Stoke Space raises $100 million,"Washington-based startup Stoke Space raised $100 million in new funds, the company announced Thursday, as it aims to develop a fully reusable rocket called “Nova.” Stoke’s latest investment round was led by Industrious Ventures – with the firm’s Steve Angel, chairman of chemicals giant Linde , joining the Stoke board of directors. The space company’s fundraise was also joined by investors including the University of Michigan, Sparta Group, Long Journey, Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, YCombinator, Point72 Ventures, NFX, MaC Ventures, Toyota Ventures and In-Q-Tel. Founded in 2019, Stoke had previously raised $75 million to date. A company spokesperson declined to comment on Stoke’s post-money valuation. “The priority is to be able to keep the pedal to the metal and continue to develop in order to get to market as soon as possible and really fortify what is still a very fragile commercial space economy,” Stoke co-founder and CEO Andy Lapsa told CNBC. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. Stoke’s fresh backing comes weeks after the company completed a low altitude launch of its vehicle “Hopper2,” in which the rocket-powered prototype flew to about 30 feet before landing successfully after 15 seconds. While a number of U.S. companies are aiming to develop reusable rockets to compete with the success of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Stoke is taking a different approach from its rivals. Lapsa explained that the company has been developing and testing the second stage of the rocket before the first stage, because “it’s not something that can be tacked on and added later.” “First of all, the technology solution wasn’t out there yet, [and, second,] we wanted to know what that looked like in order to build the right first stage to go under it,” Lapsa said. Stoke is developing Nova to be a “medium” class rocket that can deliver 5,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. That puts Nova in the middle of the launch market, between Rocket Lab’s “light” Electron and SpaceX’s “heavy” Falcon 9 in terms of capability. Stoke has 95 employees currently, with a manufacturing and engineering facility in Kent, Washington, and a test facility in Moses Lake, Washington. Earlier this year Space Force assigned Stoke with a launchpad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, which Lapsa said the company is starting to develop. Next up will be evolving its “Hopper2” vehicle “into an orbit-ready second stage,” Lapsa said, and building the large first stage of the rocket, all of which should be “coming together pretty soon.” “We’re trying to position ourselves to provide the best value to the satellite industry, in order to really shorten the time from factory to revenue,” Lapsa said.",CNBC
Laya Neelakandan,Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert film surpasses $100 million in ticket sales,"In this article Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert film is already a $100 million blockbuster — and it hasn’t even hit theaters yet. AMC announced Thursday that global advance ticket sales for the pop singer’s movie surpassed the jaw-dropping threshold this week. “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is set to hit the big screen on Oct. 13 in more than 100 countries across the world, distributed by AMC. AMC said audience demand for the movie has been exceedingly high since the film was announced, shattering the theater chain’s U.S. record for the highest ticket sales revenue during a single day. Box office analysts projected the film could rake in $100 million on its opening weekend, with some expecting the movie to remain in theaters longer than its scheduled run due to the high interest. The film will chronicle Swift’s experience during her record-breaking Eras Tour.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,"GM’s stock hits three-year low amid UAW strike, potential air bag recall","In this article DETROIT – General Motors’ stock price fell below $30 a share during intraday trading Thursday for the first time in more than three years amid ongoing strikes by the United Auto Workers union and a report of a potentially costly airbag recall for the automaker. Since the UAW union’s targeted strikes began Sept. 15, shares of the Detroit automaker have fallen by about 10%. The stock closed Thursday at $30.31 a share, down by 2.4%. The most recent share decline occurred midday Thursday following The Wall Street Journal reporting GM has at least 20 million vehicles built with a potentially dangerous air-bag part that the government says should be recalled before more people are hurt or killed. The potential recall of roughly 52 million air-bag inflators from Tennessee-based auto supplier ARC Automotive had been reported about previously, but the number of affected GM vehicles had not. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration held a public meeting Thursday on its determination that the air-bag parts are defective and should be recalled, according to the report. Automakers, including GM, have until later this year to file responses on the matter. GM has recalled about 1 million vehicles due to the problem. The company reiterated Thursday that it “believes the evidence and data presented by NHTSA at this time does not provide a basis for any recall” beyond the ones the company has already done. “Neither the affected automakers nor NHTSA, despite eight years of study and investigation, have identified a systemic design or manufacturing defect in ARC frontal airbag inflators,” the company said in an emailed statement. “If GM concludes at any time that any unrecalled ARC inflators are unsafe, the company will take appropriate action in cooperation with NHTSA.” GM said it “will continue to work collaboratively with NHTSA, other manufacturers, and ARC to monitor and investigate the long-term performance and safety of ARC airbag inflators.” While many Wall Street analysts have said a strike by the UAW was already priced into GM shares, the automaker’s stock has only experienced five positive trading days out of 14 sessions. GM confirmed Thursday it had made a counteroffer to the union, marking its sixth since the start of negotiations. It comes a day after the automaker said the strike cost it $200 million in lost production during the third quarter. “We believe we have a compelling offer that would reward our team members and allow GM to succeed and thrive into the future. We continue to stand ready and willing to negotiate in good faith 24/7 to reach an agreement,” the company said Thursday in an emailed statement. The last time shares of GM dropped below $30 a share during intraday trading was on Oct. 2, 2020, according to FactSet.",CNBC
Lillian Rizzo,Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy’s TGL golf league will air on ESPN,"Disney’ s ESPN has nabbed the broadcast rights to air matches from TGL, the startup golf league led by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. TGL, which is in partnership with the PGA Tour, will have its debut Jan. 9 as part of a multiyear deal. A preview show will air on Disney’s broadcast network ABC on Dec. 30. The early games of the TGL season will air near other sports events and appear on Disney’s ESPN+, a move that allows the streamer to bulk up on more live sports rights. The inaugural match will air the night after the College Football Playoff’s title game, and the second will come the following evening after an NFL wild-card playoff game. Both TGL matches will air on traditional TV’s ESPN and streamer ESPN+. The rest of the matches will air on ESPN’s TV networks, as well as ESPN+. The launch of the new league comes as professional golf finds itself at a major crossroads following a proposed deal between the Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund-backed rival LIV Golf in June. The agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV has yet to be finalized. The Tour has attracted potential outside investors, including Endeavor Group Holdings and Fenway Sports Group, CNBC recently reported. Some of the outside investors are considering making a rival pitch to PIF’s proposal. TGL, a new primetime, high-tech golf league created by Woods, McIlroy and former NBC Sports executive Mike McCarley, has attracted stars from the PGA Tour. In addition to Woods and McIlroy, other top players including Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Matt Fitzpatrick, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Xander Schauffele, Max Homa, Rickie Fowler and Billy Horschel have committed to play. More players are expected to be announced. The PGA Tour is an investor in the new league, and the new league has said the event timing will be complementary to the players’ schedules in the Tour. Steve Cohen, billionaire and owner of Major League Baseball’s New York Mets, is also an investor after buying the founding rights to the New York team in TGL. His team will be managed by his family office, Cohen Private Ventures. The league will feature the Tour players split into six teams, who will play two-hour, head-to-head match-play matches in a specially built arena in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The matches will incorporate live action as well as the latest golf technology.",CNBC
John Rosevear,Rivian shares fell over 20% after the EV maker said it plans to raise $1.5 billion,"In this article Shares of Rivian Automotive fell sharply on Thursday, after the company surprised investors with a plan to offer $1.5 billion in convertible notes. It also provided a preliminary estimate of its third-quarter revenue that was in line with Wall Street estimates. Shares closed down over 22% on Thursday. In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Rivian said it expects its third-quarter revenue to come in between $1.29 billion and $1.33 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street estimates of $1.3 billion, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Rivian also estimated that it had cash and equivalents of $9.1 billion as of Sep. 30, down from $10.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. Rivian took steps earlier this year to slow spending and bolster its balance sheet, including a 6% staff reduction in February and a $1.3 billion sale of convertible notes in March. The company also delayed the launch of its upcoming smaller R2 vehicle platform to 2026, from 2025. But news of the latest offering came as a surprise to investors. Rivian plans to offer $1.5 billion worth of senior, unsecured “green” convertible notes due in 2030. Buyers will have the option to purchase up to an additional $225 million worth of notes, the company said. Rivian on Monday reported third-quarter deliveries that were better than Wall Street had expected. The EV maker will report its third-quarter earnings after the U.S. markets close Nov. 7.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,Clorox shares slide after company says cyberattack hit sales hard,"In this article Shares of Clorox fell more than 5% Thursday, a day after the company said an August cyberattack significantly weighed on sales and profits during the prior quarter. The stock hit a 52-week low and is down more than 11% so far this year. While the Pine-Sol and bleach maker said it had contained the hack, which severely hampered its production, it said it continues to deal with the fallout even as its operations gradually get back to normal. Raymond James also downgraded the stock to market perform Thursday morning, citing the larger-than-expected material effect the attack had on the company. Raymond James said it struggles “to see a recovery in the stock near-term, as it would be based on a view of a quick sales and profit bounce back from the attack during a period in which consumers appear to be making more price conscious choices and as commodity costs start to move upward again.” Clorox said after the bell Wednesday that it expects to report a 23% to 28% decline in sales during the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Clorox also said it estimates its gross margin for the quarter will be down from the year-ago period. It expects to post a per share loss of 35 cents to 75 cents. On an adjusted basis, it projects a loss of up to 40 cents a share.",CNBC
Stefan Sykes,Constellation Brands beats on earnings as Modelo-fueled beer momentum continues,"In this article Constellation Brands on Thursday reported earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations for its fiscal second quarter of 2024. The Mexican beer powerhouse, owner of the Modelo Especial and Corona Extra brands, reported double-digit sales growth in its beer business as the division continues to dominate the overall beer and high-end categories. Meanwhile, sales of wine and spirits lagged. The company raised its fiscal 2024 earnings per share outlook to a range of $9.60 to $9.80, up from a prior range of $9.35 to $9.65. Here’s what Constellation reported for the three months ending Aug. 31, compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Constellation’s beer portfolio posted 12% sales growth, boosted by 8.7% growth in shipments. The Modelo brand family was a particular bright spot: Modelo Especial grew nearly 9%, while Modelo Chelada brands posted growth of more than 40%. Modelo Especial remains the best-selling brand in the U.S. beer category, the company said. The company’s wine and spirits brands, however, underperformed year over year. The category posted a 14% decrease in sales and a nearly 8% decrease in depletions, an industry term for the number of cases sold to retailers by a distributor. On a conference call with analysts Thursday, CEO Bill Newlands said the company’s wine and spirits business continued to face lower demand, primarily among its mainstream brands, as consumers continue to favor premium-priced beverages. The division wasn’t without its standout brands, though: Constellation’s Meiomi and Kim Crawford wine brands saw 7% and 6% depletion growth, respectively, while its craft spirit, Mi Campo Tequila, reported more than 60% depletion growth. Newlands added that the wine and spirits business should begin to benefit from price increases and a boost from direct-to-consumer channels. “The benefits of our wine and spirits strategy continue to take hold. We expected net sales growth and operating income growth of that business to ramp up through the remainder of fiscal ’24,” said Newlands. “And as we look to the coming years, we anticipate our wine and spirits business to further gain momentum and achieve stronger results.” Back in June, the company delivered an earnings beat and reiterated its forecast. In its previous quarter, beer sales rose 11% year over year driven by stable consumer demand and higher pricing.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Weight loss drugs may be linked to stomach paralysis, study says","In this article Blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic may be associated with an increased risk of three rare, but severe, stomach conditions in non-diabetic patients, according to a new epidemiological study released Thursday.  The study, published in the research journal JAMA, comes as Novo Nordisk ’s Wegovy, Ozempic and similar treatments skyrocket in popularity in the U.S. for their ability to cause dramatic weight loss over time. But those drugs, known as GLP-1s, are also facing increased scrutiny after some patients reported experiencing stomach paralysis and suicidal ideation while taking them.  GLP-1s work by slowing digestion to suppress a person’s appetite but can cause problems if that process slows down too much. Researchers at the University of British Columbia said the conditions in the study include one disorder not named in the warning labels for those drugs: stomach paralysis, which slows or completely stops the movement of food from the stomach to the intestine and can cause symptoms like persistent vomiting.  The study also notes an increased risk of bowel obstruction, a disorder where food is blocked from passing through the small or large intestine, and pancreatitis, which refers to pancreas inflammation. The labels for the drugs already include warnings about pancreatitis and certain types of bowel obstruction. The researchers specifically examined semaglutide – the active ingredient used in Wegovy and Ozempic – and another GLP-1 called liraglutide against another weight loss treatment called bupropion-naltrexone, which works differently to help patients lose weight. Wegovy is specifically approved for weight loss in the U.S., while Ozempic is only approved for diabetes. Their research is the first large, population-level study to examine the risk of serious stomach conditions in non-diabetic patients specifically using GLP-1s for weight loss.  Previous studies have highlighted the risk of those conditions in diabetic patients taking GLP-1s, according to the researchers. People with diabetes are also at increased risk of experiencing stomach paralysis and pancreatitis overall, even without the treatments.  “That’s why we kind of wanted to take diabetes out of the equation,” said Mohit Sodhi, one of the authors of the study. “In addition to the fact that millions of people around the world are using these drugs to help them lose weight.”  A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk noted that some of the gastrointestinal side effects in the study are already included on the labels for its GLP-1s, adding that the company “stands behind the safety and efficacy of all of our GLP-1 medicines when used consistent with the product labeling and approved indications.” “We recommend patients take these medications for their approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional,” the spokesperson said. “Treatment decisions should be made together with a healthcare provider who can evaluate the appropriateness of using a GLP-1 based on assessment of a patient’s individual medical profile.” The study findings are based on an analysis of health insurance claim records for roughly 16 million U.S. patients.  Researchers specifically looked at people with a recent history of obesity who were prescribed semaglutide or liraglutide between 2006 and 2020. They excluded those with diabetes or patients who had been prescribed another diabetes drug.  Most patients in the study were prescribed liraglutide, but researchers said the increased risks they observed could apply to the entire GLP-1 drug class.  “Our data end date was the end of 2020, while the recent boom in semaglutide happened in the last year,” Sodhi said. “Nonetheless, we believe it is a class effect.”  The researchers measured the rate at which patients developed four different serious stomach conditions while taking semaglutide, liraglutide and bupropion-naltrexone, which are stomach paralysis, pancreatitis, bowel obstruction and biliary disease, a group of conditions affecting the gall bladder. Compared with bupropion-naltrexone, GLP-1s were associated with a 9 times higher risk of pancreatitis, a 4 times higher risk of bowel obstruction and a more than 3 times higher risk of stomach paralysis, according to the study. The findings suggest the risks of those conditions are higher in patients specifically taking GLP-1s rather than other weight loss medications that work differently. Around 7 out of every 1,000 patients experienced stomach paralysis while taking liraglutide, and nearly 10 out of every 1,000 patients experienced that condition while taking semaglutide.  And Sodhi noted, “the number just continues to climb when you blow it up to the population level.”  “When you have more than a million people taking the medication worldwide, that’s 10,000 people who could potentially experience gastroparesis according to the incidence rate for semaglutide,” he told CNBC. “It’s rare, but that’s still a lot of people.” Almost 5 out of every 1,000 patients experienced pancreatitis while taking semaglutide, while roughly 8 out of every 1,000 patients experienced that condition while taking liraglutide.  Meanwhile, around 8 out of every 1,000 patients experienced bowel obstruction while taking either of those GLP-1s.  The researchers also found a high rate of biliary disease in patients taking either liraglutide or semaglutide, but they said the difference was “not found to be statistically significant.” The researchers hope the study will inform health-care providers prescribing GLP-1s about the potential drawbacks of taking the drugs.  “We’re all big proponents for informed patient consent,” Sodhi said. “If someone has decided they would like to take a GLP-1 for weight loss, we encourage them to have a conversation with their provider about how it may help them achieve their goals. But they should also be made aware of the potential drawbacks of taking this medication.” ",CNBC
John Rosevear,Lucid’s shares fall after company launches a cheaper version of the Air EV,"In this article Shares of Lucid Group fell on Thursday after the company launched a cheaper version of its Air electric luxury sedan in a bid to stoke demand. The stock closed down about 7% on Thursday following the news. Lucid said it will now offer a single-motor, rear-wheel-drive version of its Air Pure sedan starting at $77,400 with 410 miles of range. That’s $5,000 lower than its previous lowest-cost model, the dual-motor all-wheel-drive version of the Air Pure, which is still available. The new single-motor Air Pure is available for order immediately, Lucid said. Lucid’s shares are down over 24% since the beginning of 2023 through Thursday’s close as concerns linger about ongoing demand for the Air. While the Air has received strong reviews and can claim the longest range of any electric vehicle currently available in the U.S., it’s expensive, a growing concern as consumer borrowing costs have risen and as rivals including EV giant Tesla have cut prices sharply over the past several months. The new rear-wheel-drive version of the Air Pure is the first Lucid offering to start below $80,000. At the high end, the 1,234 horsepower Sapphire version of the Air costs $249,000. Lucid hasn’t yet released its third-quarter production and deliveries totals. It’s expected to report its third-quarter financial results in early November.",CNBC
Robert Frank,Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos retires after boosting sales sixfold,"Torsten Muller-Otvos, the Rolls-Royce CEO who turned an aging brand into a coveted badge of success for pop stars, athletes and young entrepreneurs, is retiring after 14 years. Rolls-Royce announced Thursday that Muller-Otvos, 63, the longest-serving CEO of Rolls-Royce in nearly a century, will retire on Dec. 1. He will be succeeded by Chris Brownridge, currently chief executive officer of BMW UK. Muller-Otvos brought new shine to the Rolls-Royce brand and became a leader in the luxury world by attracting a new generation of wealthy buyers. With sleek models like the fastback Wraith, and edgy design schemes like Black Badge, Rolls-Royce’s sales grew more than sixfold during his tenure, from 1,000 cars sold in 2010 to more than 6,000 last year. The average age of a Rolls-Royce buyer fell from 56 to 43. One in 5 buyers today is a celebrity. “The brand is contemporary today, I would say cool again,” Muller-Otvos told CNBC. “That indicates to me that we got it right, not just me but the entire team. That makes me extremely proud as I look back and see what a fabulous, fabulous journey we had.” Muller-Otvos also launched Rolls-Royce into its next big chapter with last year’s unveiling of the first fully electric Rolls, called Spectre. The two-door, 577-horsepower behemoth can do zero to 60 in 4.4 seconds and is already sold out in the U.S. through 2025, despite its steep price of more than $413,000. The big question going forward for Rolls is whether it can maintain its cool factor, and strong sales, if the U.S. economy starts to falter. The U.S. remains its largest market, and while Mutter-Otvos said demand and orders remain strong, the company is always prepared for a correction. “The luxury market is not immune against any recessionary developments,” he said. “For us, the business is still very strong, but it is on a different level compared to what it used to be right after the pandemic. I would say that has normalized now to levels we are used to, but we are still in a very strong position.” Muller-Otvos is the longest-serving CEO of Rolls-Royce since Claude Johnson, who brought Charles Rolls and Henry Royce together in 1904 and served until 1926. Muller-Otvos said when he joined Rolls-Royce, it was an elite brand that was aging fast. Its signature, the four-door Phantom, was designed for chauffeurs to ferry around members of the graying leisure class smoothly and silently. Muller-Otvos visited private bankers around the world to find out how the wealthy were quickly changing — especially with the rise of tech wealth. “That was quite an eye-opening moment,” he said. “All the private banks told me their clients were getting younger, far more informal and with a lot more women. We said to ourselves, we need something to attract this younger consumer. It needed to be rejuvenated. That’s not something you can do in just two years. That is a long, long story that takes many years to achieve.” In 2013, Rolls-Royce unveiled the Wraith, a racy, two-door coupe with a twin-turbo V12 that was designed for the wealthy to drive, rather than to be driven in. That was followed in 2015 by the Dawn convertible, and in 2019 by the Cullinan SUV, which became a favorite of NBA stars and other big athletes. Rolls-Royce debuted the Black Badge line in 2016, featuring higher performance and an all-black color scheme (including the famous Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament). Muller-Otvos also ushered in a new era of customization, which lured new customers and bigger profit margins. Dubbed “Bespoke,” the program allows Rolls-Royce buyers to choose their own fabrics, paint colors, materials and interior lighting schemes to make a one-of-a-kind Rolls. The customization program is one reason the average sale price of a Rolls-Royce has doubled since Muller-Otvos took over, to about 500,000 euros ($527,000). “None of our clients want just a product off the shelf,” he said. “They want it to carry their individual signature and their individual story. We have put a lot of resources into Bespoke and now every car leaving [our factory] is fully bespoke.”",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Netflix is set to report earnings – here’s what Wall Street expects,"In this article LOS ANGELES — Netflix is due to report third-quarter earnings after the closing bell Wednesday. The streaming company is still navigating its transformation from focusing on subscriber growth to focusing on profit, using price hikes, password crackdowns and ad-supported tiers to boost revenue. Further complicating matters are production delays resulting from a nearly 150-day writers strike that wrapped up in September and an ongoing actors strike that threatens to prevent and postpone production through the new year. Investors will be looking to hear from the company’s executives about how Netflix will grapple with these headwinds and for a status report on its ad tier. Here’s what Wall Street expects:  Netflix in the last week has seen a series of slashed price targets and revised forecasts from Wall Street analysts, most of whom are awaiting further clarity on the company’s growth strategy. Company executives previously warned investors that its ad tier is still in its infancy and shareholders shouldn’t expect it to have a major impact on revenue until at least the end of the year. Additionally, they have signaled that operating margins will grow more gradually going forward as it invests in more growth opportunities. It’s been less than six months since Netflix instituted its password crackdown, so it’s unclear what impact that initiative has had for the company and how much executives will share.",CNBC
Diana Olick,Mortgage demand falls to the lowest level since 1995 as interest rates near 8%,"Mortgage rates last week rose for the sixth straight week, causing demand for home loans to drop to the lowest level since 1995. Total application volume fell 6.9% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.70% from 7.67% and points decreased to 0.71 from 0.75 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the highest rate since November 2000. The rate was 6.94% during the same week one year ago. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 6% week to week and were 21% lower than the same week one year ago. Applications to refinance a home loan fell 10% for the week and were 12% lower than a year ago. “Both purchase and refinance applications declined, driven by larger drops for conventional applications,” said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. He added that the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) share was 9.3%, the highest share in 11 months. ARMs offer lower rates and can be fixed for up to 10 years before the rate resets. More borrowers are turning to these loan products to gain purchasing power, as both interest rates and home prices are rising. Mortgage rates moved even higher to start this week, with the 30-year fixed hitting 7.92% on Tuesday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is a cyclical high. The increase was due to a much stronger-than-expected monthly retail sales report. Don’t miss these CNBC PRO stories:",CNBC
Hugh Son,Morgan Stanley shares fall 8% as wealth management results disappoint,"In this article Morgan Stanley posted third-quarter results Wednesday that topped profit estimates on better-than-expected trading revenue. Here’s what the company reported: Profit fell 9% to $2.41 billion, or $1.38 a share, from a year ago, the New York-based bank said in a statement. Revenue grew 2% to $13.27 billion, essentially matching expectations. The bank’s shares fell 8%. Morgan Stanley’s trading operations helped offset revenue misses elsewhere at the firm. The bank’s bond traders produced $1.95 billion in revenue, roughly $200 million more than the StreetAccount estimate, while equity traders brought in $2.51 billion in revenue, $100 million more than expected. But the bank’s all-important wealth management division generated $6.4 billion in revenue, below the estimate by more than $200 million, as compensation costs in the division rose. Net interest income sank 9% from the second quarter and will fall again in the fourth quarter, the bank’s CFO warned. Investment banking accounted for another miss in the quarter, producing $938 million in revenue, below the $1.11 billion estimate, as the company cited weakness in mergers and IPO listings. The bank’s investment management division essentially met expectations with $1.34 billion in revenue. CEO James Gorman cited a “mixed” environment for his businesses and acknowledged that the firm’s wealth management division gathered fewer new assets than in recent quarters. That’s because surging interest rates have made money market funds and Treasuries attractive, he told analysts Wednesday. The wealth management business was still tracking to hit his three-year goal of generating $1 trillion in new assets, he added. “When people have a choice of making a 4%, 5% return by doing nothing, they’re not going to be trading in the markets,” Gorman said. Led by Gorman since 2010, Morgan Stanley has managed to avoid the turbulence afflicting some rivals lately. While Goldman Sachs was forced to pivot after a foray into retail banking and as Citigroup struggles to lift its stock price, the main question at Morgan Stanley is about an orderly CEO succession. In May, Gorman announced his plan to resign within a year, capping a successful tenure marked by massive acquisitions in wealth and asset management. Morgan Stanley’s board has narrowed the search for his successor to three internal executives, he said at the time. Gorman reiterated his desire to hand over the CEO position to a successor within months. “This firm is in excellent shape notwithstanding the geopolitical and market turmoil that we find ourselves in,” Gorman said. “My hope and expectation is to hand over Morgan Stanley with as clean a slate as possible and deal with a few of our outstanding issues in the next couple of months.” Last week, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each topped expectations for third-quarter profit, helped by low credit costs. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also beat estimates on stronger-than-expected bond trading results.

Robert Hum,Want to see what weak discretionary spending looks like? See Winnebago’s results,"In this article Winnebago closed out its fiscal year with a solid fourth quarter earnings beat. Adjusted per-share profit of $1.59 easily topped Wall Street expectations thanks to the recreational-vehicle maker’s ability to efficiently manage costs, production and inventories in the quarter. But that masked a big problem for the company – weaker discretionary spending. It’s a challenge across several sectors, from blue jeans to pizza delivery, as high inflation saps consumers. The company on Wednesday also posted revenue of $771 million, a nearly 35% decline from a year ago. It fell short of Wall Street’s expected $784 million, as sales in its motorhome RV division significantly missed consensus views ($318 million vs. $355 million expected, according to StreetAccount). Winnebago blamed “lower unit sales related to current market conditions and dealer efforts to reduce inventories, and higher discounts and allowances.” Unit deliveries of motorhome RVs plunged 52% year-over year. Price increases weren’t nearly enough to overcome the weak demand. CEO Michael Happe said “the consumer market continues to be challenged, and our fourth quarter results reflect a stubborn retail environment.” While the company didn’t give financial guidance, Happe said he expects those trends to continue into the first half of the new fiscal year. By the second half of the fiscal year, though, Happe is optimistic that inventories will normalize and consumer demand will stabilize. Winnebago’s stock, which was down 3% Wednesday, had fallen about 13% over the last three months, far underperforming the broader market. Rival Thor Industries had also fallen about 17% in that same timespan – a reflection of the challenging demand conditions across the industry.",CNBC
Melissa Repko,Walmart beefs up third-party marketplace as it challenges online rival Amazon,"In this article It was summer in Las Vegas — the temperature hit nearly 110 degrees that late August day — but Christmas was on everyone’s minds. While Santa Claus wandered around during an invitation-only conference, businesses that sell items on Walmart’s website attended how-to sessions and swapped advice. Walmart leaders gave third-party marketplace sellers an early gift, too: Waiving extra fees for storing merchandise during the peak season. Doug McMillon, who leads the world’s largest retailer, took the stage and made a sales pitch to the smaller businesses and brands. “We hope you’ll choose to grow with us,” the CEO told the more than 1,500 attendees, invoking the memory of company founder Sam Walton, who was at one time a small-town entrepreneur. “We want you to bring great items to our marketplace. Our team is here to serve you.” As Walmart heads into the retail industry’s most important season, the company is trying to recruit and retain hundreds of thousands of independent sellers that fill the company’s virtual shelves with items ranging from lip gloss to Rolex watches. It is also working to coax those sellers into paying Walmart to pack and ship — and even advertise — their products. It is leaning into a moment when inflation has pushed more high-income shoppers to its stores and website. This holiday season will put Walmart’s e-commerce strategy to the test. Already, the company is using the third-party marketplace to try to drum up early business. More than half the items included in Walmart’s sales event last week, which kicked off the season, were from its third-party marketplace. The event coincided with Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days event, but there were no comparisons available. About 70% of items included in Walmart Plus Week, which coincided with Amazon Prime Day in July, were marketplace items. Walmart wouldn’t share comparisons with sales events in prior years, but said more sellers are participating in the events overall. There are signs Walmart’s growing third-party marketplace could help the company defy slower spending patterns and capitalize on inflation-wary shoppers. Online sales for Walmart U.S. rose sharply the past two fiscal quarters, even as other major retailers such as Macy’s and Target reported declines. As shoppers at many stores, including Walmart’s own, skipped over discretionary purchases, Walmart’s third-party marketplace saw sales in some discretionary categories such as home and apparel rise by double digits in the most recent fiscal quarter. Tom Ward, chief e-commerce officer for Walmart U.S., said the company’s app and website have a fresh look, its fulfillment centers and stores have automation that’s helping power more late-night and last-minute deliveries and its growing marketplace has helped create an “endless aisle” of electronics, toys and groceries to give customers a reason to return. “Customers want choice,” he said. “They want that selection. They want that variety. And as they visit us more and more often, they expect to see it.” When it comes to e-commerce, Walmart is in a rare spot: the underdog. Its online sales are just a tiny fraction of what Amazon rings up — and that carries over to the companies’ third-party marketplaces, too. Customers who shop on Amazon and Walmart’s website see a mix of items. Some items are sold directly by the retailers and others are sold by sellers that own the inventory, list items on other retailers’ websites and share a cut of the profits with those retailers. Amazon has more than one million active sellers, and Walmart has roughly 100,000, according to Marketplace Pulse, a third-party firm that collects data on e-commerce marketplaces including Amazon, eBay and Etsy . Amazon and Walmart do not disclose how many active sellers they have. For Walmart, closing that large gap is an uphill climb, and also an opportunity, said Rick Watson, CEO of RMW Commerce Consulting, an e-commerce consulting firm with clients that cut across categories such as furniture, fashion and food and beverage categories. “Amazon has never been known as the most seller-friendly place to do business,” he said. “Something I’ve seen recently is a lot of sellers actually cheering for Walmart because they want an alternative.” Tension between Amazon and some of its sellers is at the heart of an antitrust lawsuit filed in late September by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon. The suit accuses the e-commerce behemoth of anticompetitive practices, such as punishing sellers for offering cheaper prices on other websites and strong-arming them into using its fulfillment services. Amazon denied the allegations in a blog post, saying the company has helped, not harmed, customers, and contributed to lower prices and speedier services. Watson said sellers can struggle to get someone on the phone on Amazon. At Walmart, on the other hand, he said sellers tend to get more “red carpet treatment.” But first, Walmart often has to persuade successful sellers on Amazon to take a chance on the relative newcomer, such as companies like Lucky 21. About a year and a half ago, the apparel retailer that represents national brands such as Disney, New Balance and Reebok tested sales of some items on Walmart’s marketplace. Melissa LaCognata, vice president and divisional merchandise manager for Lucky 21, said the company knew Walmart was years behind Amazon. Yet, she said it heard about Walmart’s investments in marketplace and knew Walmart already had a large brick-and-mortar customer base and sizable online traffic. “It’s like being in the second-best mall in the world,” she said. “Why not?” Last year, Lucky 21 became the largest third-party seller of children’s apparel on Walmart’s website. But Walmart has had to play a major game of catch-up, such as simplifying the on-boarding process to make it easier for new marketplace sellers to join and launching membership program, Walmart+, to drive more online sales. Three years ago, it launched Walmart Fulfillment Services, which allows sellers to pay the retailer to store inventory and pack and ship orders. Amazon began offering a similar picking-and-packing service in 2006. This summer, Walmart announced another wave of features to better compete with Amazon. It has begun to offer fulfillment for sellers’ big and bulky items as well as merchandise that comes in multiple boxes, such as canoes or patio sets. It also debuted tools to support sellers’ businesses, such as allowing them to hire Walmart to make local deliveries of cakes or other online orders or pay Walmart for software to power curbside pickup at shops. Walmart is looking to its more than 4,600 stores across the country as another way to outmatch Amazon. The stores act as mini warehouses, with more than 50% of online orders fulfilled from its stores as of the end of its most recent quarter, which ended in late July. About 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, proximity that makes it possible for Walmart to sometimes to get a package to customers’ doors faster than Amazon. So far, Walmart does not carry third-party marketplace items in its stores, which means customers can’t get those online orders through curbside pickup or ultra-speedy delivery to their homes. Yet, Jaré Buckley-Cox, vice president of Walmart Fulfillment Services and an Amazon veteran, said that is coming within the next five years and described it as “a high priority.” Some customers have gotten a glimpse of how that might look. One of Walmart’s popular marketplace items has become tires, which shoppers can ship to select stores and get installed at Walmart’s auto center. As inflation weighs on Americans’ budgets, Walmart’s marketplace could help the retailer crack one of its longtime challenges: convincing shoppers to buy more high-margin items such as a sweater or purse, along with a box of cereal or loaf of bread. Walmart has tried and backed away from other strategies to do that. It previously went on an acquisition spree of direct-to-consumer brands with a fan following including Bonobos, Moosejaw and Eloquii after buying Jet.com in a $3.3 billion deal. It has since reversed course and sold off those companies, as it focuses on turning its online business profitable. Over the past year, Walmart, the country’s largest grocer, has reported market share gains for groceries coming from households that make more than $100,000 a year. That may be helping to lift the use of Walmart’s app. According to estimates by third-party firm Apptopia, which analyzes trends with mobile apps and connected devices, Walmart’s shopping app has now surpassed Amazon’s in terms of daily use. The third-party marketplace is another approach: a way to add items without the risk of buying pallets of inventory and wondering if it will sell — or get marked down. Walmart can monitor and quickly add popular or relevant products, said Michael Mosser, vice president of categories for Walmart’s U.S. marketplace. For example, he said, sellers helped Walmart bulk up on more hot pink and Barbie-themed items. They also can help in unexpected scenarios, such as when smoke from the Canadian wildfires caused East Coast residents to search for air filtration systems, he said. “We’re not buying products a year out or three quarters of a year out,” Mosser said. “If we see something trending in social media or we see something trending as a cultural moment, we can reach out to our community of sellers and be like, ’Hey, we’re seeing this thing spiking. What do you have for available inventory?” Some items Walmart has tested and expanded on its website through marketplace are premium brands that Americans may not expect to find on Walmart’s website, such as Michael Kors, Dyson and Solo Stove. Solo Stove’s fire pits start at about $100 on Walmart.com, but range as high as $1,155 for a set that includes a fire pit, lid, shield and collection of portable camping accessories. John Merris, CEO of Solo Brands , said Solo Stove already had traction on Amazon and questioned whether Walmart would draw the kinds of customers willing to spring for a more expensive, discretionary item. “You wonder not only is it not your customer, but more importantly, does it cheapen your brand?” he said. “Is there a perception with consumers that if your product is found in Walmart that somehow means that you have a lower quality product?” He said Solo Stove’s perspective changed. It began to sell the smokeless fire pits on Walmart’s website early last year. It got a bump in business during Walmart’s competing sales event during Amazon’s Prime Day in July. Solo Stove’s sales are up 300% on Walmart’s marketplace as of this fall, compared with the year-ago period. Soon, the fire pits will hit Walmart’s store shelves. Merris got surprised with a purchase order at the company’s seller summit in late August. He joked that he has high hopes for store sales, especially since they’ll be a few aisles away from ingredients for s’mores. If Walmart uses stores to speed along deliveries and adds more brands across price points that customers love, Merris said the discounter “could be very dangerous for a marketplace like Amazon in the future.” Don’t miss these CNBC PRO stories: — CNBC’s Gabriel Cortés contributed to this report.",CNBC
Amelia Lucas,"Procter & Gamble tops earnings, revenue estimates even as volume falls again","In this article Procter & Gamble on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations, despite volume falling for the sixth consecutive quarter. Shares of the company rose more than 2% in early trading. Here’s what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: P&G reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $4.52 billion, or $1.83 per share, up from $3.94 billion, or $1.57 per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose 6% to $21.87 billion. The company’s organic revenue increased 7% in the quarter, helped by higher prices for P&G’s products. But the company’s volume shrank 1%. The metric excludes the impact of currency and pricing changes to reflect demand. For roughly two years, P&G has been raising prices on its products like Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper. “For obvious reasons we don’t comment on the future direction of pricing, but I will tell you that we’re happy with where we sit currently,” CEO Jon Moeller said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” P&G hasn’t gotten any pushback from retailers about its higher prices, beyond “normal discussions” about maximizing customer value, CFO Andre Schulten told analysts on the company’s conference call. But some consumers aren’t happy with P&G’s higher prices. Some shoppers have switched to cheaper private-label alternatives as a result, and P&G said it saw “pricing-related volume declines” across many of its brands. However, its volume declines have narrowed in recent quarters, and the company expects to report volume growth for the fiscal year. The company’s baby, feminine and family care segment reported its volume fell 3%. The division includes brands like Pampers and Bounty. P&G’s grooming segment, which includes Venus and Gillette products, reported a 2% drop in volume. The company’s fabric and home-care business saw its volume shrink 1%, even as customers bought more of its premium cleaning products, which include Swiffer and Cascade. P&G’s health-care division was the only segment to report volume growth for the quarter. The company said it saw strong demand for respiratory products, like those made by Vicks. The company also widened its outlook for fiscal 2024 revenue as it anticipates that foreign exchange rates could be a larger drag than previously expected. The company now projects revenue growth of 2% to 4%, rather than its prior forecast of 3% to 4%. P&G reiterated its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth, which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, and for earnings per share growth. But Schulten warned about economic conditions that could weaken performance, like rising energy costs heading into the winter, lower household savings rates and the health of the Chinese market.

Leslie Josephs,"United Airlines tumbles 8% after warning pricier fuel, Middle East war will cut profits","In this article United Airlines on Tuesday said more expensive jet fuel and a halt to the carrier’s Tel Aviv flights during the Israel-Hamas war will eat into its profits in the last three months of the year. The airline’s shares were down 8% in mid-morning trading. For the current quarter, the Chicago-based carrier estimated adjusted earnings of between $1.50 and $1.80 a share, below analysts’ forecasts of $2.06. United would then earn between $9.55 and $9.85 a share, on an adjusted basis, down from its forecast in July of between $11 and $12 a share, based on its projection for the fourth quarter. Jet fuel prices in major U.S. airports are up nearly 25% since the start of summer. The fourth-quarter guidance “is bleak and worse than our estimates,” wrote Helane Becker, an airline analyst at TD Cowen, in a note on Wednesday. “Given the projections that this will be a long war we are looking at the lower end of the forecast range and assuming no service by year end.” United and other U.S. and international carriers halted their flights to Israel earlier this month. United had more service to Israel than any of the U.S.-based airlines with service from Washington, D.C.; Newark, New Jersey; and San Francisco, accounting for 2% of its capacity. United said its fourth-quarter revenue will rise year over year between 9%, if Israel flights remain suspended through the end of the year, and 10.5% if the suspension lasts only through October. Its costs, excluding fuel, will likely rise between 3.5% and 5% in the fourth quarter from 2022, United said. Speaking to CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday, CEO Scott Kirby attributed the increase to “much higher labor costs than anyone anticipated at the start of the year,” delayed aircraft from manufacturers and air traffic controller shortages. The Israel service suspension comes after a robust summer for air travel with revenue growth for international destinations outpacing sales of domestic tickets. That has put big, global carriers such as United and Delta on better footing than some discount airlines such as Spirit , which focus more on U.S. cities and expect losses. Here’s what United reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: United posted third-quarter net income of $1.14 billion, or $3.42 a share, versus $942 million, or $2.86 a share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, United posted earnings per share of $3.65. Revenue rose to $14.48 billion from $12.88 billion. The carrier will hold a call with analysts and media on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET, when it will face questions on fourth-quarter demand and how the carrier plans to tamp down rising costs.",CNBC
Contessa Brewer,Thousands of casino workers go on strike in Detroit,"In this article Auto workers aren’t the only ones on strike in Detroit. Thousands of casino workers, seeking higher wages and better working conditions, walked off the job in the city Tuesday. Casino workers are seeking higher wages and better working conditions as the cost of living has increased in recent years.  The work stoppage targets operations at the MGM Grand Detroit, owned by MGM Resorts International ; MotorCity Casino; and Hollywood Casino at Greektown, owned by Penn Entertainment . Striking employees include 3,700 workers employed in positions across the properties, including dealers, cleaning staff, food and beverage workers, valets, engineers and more. They are represented by the Detroit Casino Council, which is made up of five unions including the United Auto Workers. The effect was immediately clear. MotorCity Casino updated its website showing that high-limit table games and poker rooms as well as casino valet were closed, in addition to its spa and some restaurants and bars. FanDuel, which operates the FD Sportsbook in conjunction with MotorCity, told CNBC it will be closed with the exception of a non-union MCC employee managing the cash at the counter for patrons needing to cash in tickets, which keeps with Michigan regulatory requirements. The Hollywood Casino at Greektown said in a statement to CNBC, “We are disappointed by the decision of the Detroit Casino Council as we have made generous, progressive settlement offers that position our team members and business for sustainable success.” The management says it will remain open for business. Matt Buckley, president and COO of MGM’s Midwest Group, sent a letter to employees of MGM Grand Detroit that made clear the company also intends to keep the property open and running. “Regarding the status of our negotiations, we’ve made six proposals to the union and our current offer includes the single largest pay increase in the history of MGM Grand Detroit. It is a significant proposal,” he wrote. The Detroit Casino Council argues casino workers agreed to a three-year contract during the pressure-packed earlier days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The deal, which has now expired, included 3% wage increases even as the cost of living has surged 20% amid high inflation, according to the union. “In contrast, industry gaming revenues have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels to reach a new record high,” the Detroit Casino Council wrote in a news release. “In 2022, the Detroit casino industry generated $2.27 billion in gaming revenue and is on track for another record-breaking year in 2023. The three Detroit casinos collectively reported $813 million more in total gaming revenues in 2022 than in 2019, but total wages paid to workers represented by the DCC were $34 million less when comparing those same years.” But brick-and-mortar casinos saw revenues of $1.2 billion in 2022, about a $200 million decline from 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. The Detroit Casino Council revenue numbers include iGaming and online sports revenues. They are required by Michigan gaming regulators to partner with land-based casinos to get a license to operate. The Detroit Casino Council estimates each day of a strike could put approximately $738,000 in city and state tax revenues and $3.4 million in casino operator revenues at risk. MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainmen t and Wynn Resorts are also facing possible walkouts in Las Vegas. Nearly 40,000 members of the Culinary Union have authorized a strike, though it hasn’t yet been called. Negotiations are ongoing. MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle told CNBC during a keynote presentation at the Global Gaming Expo last week that he and top leadership from the other casinos are involved in intense negotiations. But he said the unions in Las Vegas are influenced by other attention-grabbing strikes. “It doesn’t help when UAW in Detroit is asking for 40%. I mean, that’s a top line that’s hard to ignore,” Hornbuckle said at the time. “That being said, I think what matters here locally is people’s ability, particularly on the front line to exist, to pay rent and to get to the next step in life. And so I think that’s what’s relevant.“  Don’t miss these CNBC PRO stories:",CNBC
Michael Wayland,GM to delay all-electric truck production at Michigan plant until late 2025,"DETROIT – General Motors said Tuesday it is delaying production of all-electric trucks at a Michigan plant by at least a year to “better manage capital investments” and implement improvements in an effort to make the new EVs more profitable. GM now plans to begin construction of its next-generation EVs at Orion Assembly in suburban Detroit by late 2025, instead of next year. The factory currently produces Chevrolet Bolt EV models, which GM will cease producing at the end of this year. The delay is the latest sign of potential trouble for the ambitious, multibillion-dollar plans of traditional automakers to move to electric vehicles. Adoption of EVs, which remain costly to produce and purchase, has been slower than many expected. “General Motors today confirmed it will retime the conversion of its Orion Assembly plant to EV truck production to late 2025, to better manage capital investment while aligning with evolving EV demand. In addition, we have identified engineering improvements that we will implement to increase the profitability of our products,” the company said in a statement. The change in plans is not connected to the company’s ongoing contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union, according to a GM spokesman. However, the contentious talks do involve EVs, and current contract proposals by the company are expected to be more expensive than those in year’s past. The UAW, which represents workers at Orion Assembly, did not immediately respond for comment. The production delay calls into question GM’s previously announced EV goals, including cumulative production of 400,000 EVs in North American from 2022 through mid-2024, which had already been pushed back. GM also has a goal to exclusively offer consumer EVs by 2035. A GM spokesman late-Tuesday said there’s currently no change in plans to the company’s EV production targets. New electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra that were supposed to be produced at Orion Assembly will be assembled at GM’s Factory Zero in Detroit, the company said. Limited production of the Silverado EV is underway, while Sierra is scheduled to begin next year. Alongside the Silverado EV, Factory Zero is currently building the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV and Cruise Origin shuttle. In January 2022, GM announced it would invest $4 billion to convert Orion Assembly to produce electric trucks. The plant was expected to be its second U.S. assembly plant to exclusively produce EVs. GM said construction includes significant facility and capacity expansion at the site, including new body and paint shops and new general assembly and battery pack assembly areas.  Roughly 1,000 hourly workers at Orion Assembly will have the option to transfer to other Michigan facilities until the retooling at Orion Assembly is completed.

Hugh Son,Goldman Sachs tops estimates on stronger-than-expected bond trading,"In this article Goldman Sachs posted third-quarter profit and revenue Tuesday that exceeded analysts’ estimates on stronger-than-expected trading revenue. Shares of the bank fell more than 1%, and are down about 10% for the year. Here’s what the company reported: The bank said profit dropped 33% to $2.058 billion, or $5.47 a share, from a year earlier. Revenue also slipped 1% to $11.82 billion, though that topped expectations by roughly $600 million. Bond trading revenue fell 6% from a year earlier to $3.38 billion, but that was almost $600 million more than what analysts had expected. Goldman cited strength in interest rate products and mortgages, which helped offset declines in trading of currencies, commodities and credit. The firm’s efforts to boost lending activities in the trading division also helped as fixed income financing revenue reached a record $730 million. Equities trading revenue climbed 8% from a year earlier to $2.96 billion on higher activity in derivatives, topping the estimate by roughly $200 million. Investment banking revenue edged higher by 1% to $1.55 billion, slightly exceeding the $1.48 billion estimate. Among its big bank peers, Goldman Sachs is the most reliant on investment banking and trading revenue. While it’s made efforts under CEO David Solomon to diversify its revenue stream, first in an ill-fated retail banking push and later as it emphasized growth in asset and wealth management, it is Wall Street that powers the company. Last quarter, trading and advisory accounted for two-thirds of Goldman’s revenue. That’s been a headwind this year as mergers, initial public offerings and debt issuance all have been muted as the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates to slow the economy down. With signs that activity has picked up lately, analysts will be eager to hear about Goldman’s pipeline of deals. At the same time, Goldman has taken hits from two areas: Its strategic retrenchment away from retail banking has saddled the firm with losses as it finds buyers for unwanted operations, and its exposure to commercial real estate has resulted in write-downs as well. The bank said Tuesday it posted a $506 million third-quarter write-down tied to lending business GreenSky, and $358 million in real estate impairments. “We continue to make significant progress executing on our strategic priorities,” Solomon said in the release. “I also expect a continued recovery in both capital markets and strategic activity if conditions remain conducive. As the leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity will undoubtedly be a tailwind for Goldman Sachs.” It was a “messy” quarter for Goldman, with elevated compensation costs and firmwide returns well below the mid-teens medium-term target, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said in a research note. Analysts will be keen to hear more on Solomon’s view of the investment banking outlook, as well as how the remaining parts of its consumer effort — mainly, its Apple Card business — fit in the latest iteration of Goldman Sachs. Jim Cramer’s Investing Club shares what investors should listen for in a company’s earnings call. Last week, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each topped expectations for third-quarter profit, helped by better-than-expected credit costs. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to post results Wednesday.

Drew Richardson,North Face owner VF Corp.’s shares jump after activist investor builds stake,"In this article Activist investment firm Engaged Capital has taken a stake in VF Corporation , owner of Vans and The North Face brands, and is pushing for cost cuts and changes to the board. Shares of VF Corp. closed 14% higher Tuesday, settling at $18.45. The stock is down more than 33% so far this year. Engaged said shares of VF Corp. could jump to a share price of $46 within three years if proposed changes are implemented. It is unclear exactly how much of a stake Engaged has taken in VF Corp. Engaged said former VF Corp. CEO Steve Rendle, who abruptly left the company late last year, made a series of strategic errors during his tenure. Those, according to Engaged, include reduced autonomy among individual brands, underinvestment in Vans and the Supreme brand acquisition, which hurt the balance sheet. Rendle was appointed CEO in early 2017 and became chairman later that year. “We believe VFC’s value destruction is directly attributable to Mr. Rendle’s failed strategy and the Board’s seeming unwillingness to intervene,” the firm said. Engaged is pushing for several sweeping changes, namely an upward of $300 million in cost cuts through “elimination of duplicative costs and corporate excess.” It also wants the company to commit to holding off on acquisitions. The firm is, however, supportive of current CEO Bracken Darrell, who took the position in July. “Mr. Darrell appears to have the transformation experience VFC urgently requires,” Engaged said. VF Corp. said it is aware of Engaged’s comments and investment. “VF has globally recognized and iconic brands and best-in-class talent. VF’s Board and leadership team, including our recently appointed CEO Bracken Darrell, are taking immediate and decisive actions to strengthen the company’s position and return VF to strong, sustainable, and profitable growth in the interests of all our shareholders,” the company said.

Lillian Rizzo,Starboard CEO makes case for spinning off real estate assets from News Corp.,"In this article Activist investment firm Starboard Value is pushing for change at News Corporation , in particular to see its real estate business separated from the rest of the company. Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith told CNBC’s David Faber on Tuesday that the firm is building a position in News Corp. and has been in discussions with the company. Smith said News Corp. should split out its real estate assets, including an interest in REA Group of Australia. News Corp. also owns the Dow Jones news business, which includes publications such as The Wall Street Journal and New York Post. “Our belief is they’re going to want to … separate the digital real estate assets to be able to highlight this beautiful business for what it’s worth,” Smith said on CNBC on Tuesday. A News Corp. spokesperson said Tuesday that the company has “always maintained an active and engaged dialogue with our investors and are committed to driving shareholder value.” “We remain focused on executing our strategic plan, which has helped us set records in profitability over the past three years,” the spokesperson said. “We are proud of our rapid digital transformation and bright prospects for long-term growth and value creation.” Reuters and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Starboard’s stake in News Corp. The size of the stake has yet to be learned. The Murdoch family trust controls about 40% of the voting rights of both News Corp. and Fox Corp., making change difficult at either company. “It’s not great governance to have dual class,” Smith said Tuesday. “There have been votes to declassify, it’s something to consider as well. But there are easier paths to create a lot of value.” On Tuesday, Smith called out the valuation discrepancies between the news and real estate businesses. He noted that News Corp.’s “crown jewel” news division trades at four-times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with competitor The New York Times, which trades at 15 times. Meanwhile, News Corp.’s real estate assets trade at eight times, he said. “It’s a great business, a great asset, it’s just too cheap,” Smith said of News Corp.’s stock price. News Corp. shares were slightly down Tuesday at $21.85. He added Tuesday that he believes the split of the businesses hasn’t occurred already because the company was “a little insecure” about leaving the news division alone for a period of time. Starboard’s push for change at the company comes shortly after Rupert Murdoch said he would step down as chair of the board at both News Corp. and Fox News owner Fox Corp . Effective in November, Murdoch, 92, will become chair emeritus of each company while his son, Lachlan Murdoch, will become sole chair of News Corp. and continue as Fox Corp.’s executive chair and CEO. Lachlan Murdoch made the initial investment in REA Group two decades ago, which Smith called an “amazing investment” on Tuesday. More than a year ago, Rupert Murdoch had explored reuniting News Corp. and Fox Corp., a move that would have allowed leadership to be consolidated in the Murdoch media empire while also cutting costs. The businesses were split up in 2013. The push to rejoin the businesses had come as the audience shrinks for both print media and cable TV — Fox Corp. owns cable TV networks including Fox News — as readers and viewers increasingly get their news and entertainment from online sources. However, the proposed merger was called off in January. In a letter to the board, Murdoch said he was withdrawing the merger as he and his son “determined that a combination is not optimal for the shareholders” of either of the companies at the time. Smith said Tuesday that there had not been discussions regarding another push for a proposed merger.  Don’t miss these CNBC PRO stories:",CNBC
John Rosevear,Lucid shares fall after third-quarter EV deliveries disappoint,"In this article Luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid Group said Tuesday that it delivered 1,457 of its Air sedans to customers in the third quarter, a number that is unlikely to reassure investors worried about demand for the posh and pricey electric vehicle. Shares of the company fell on the news and ended Tuesday’s session down about 5%. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Lucid to deliver about 2,000 vehicles in the third quarter. Lucid’s third-quarter deliveries compare with 1,404 deliveries in the second quarter and 1,398 deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. The company said it produced 1,550 Airs during the period, with “over 700” additional vehicles in transit to a new facility in Saudi Arabia for final assembly. That compares to 2,173 Airs built in the second quarter and 2,282 Airs a year earlier.   Saudi Arabia’s government, a major investor in Lucid, agreed last year to buy at least 50,000 Lucid EVs over the following 10 years, with an option to buy up to 50,000 more. Deliveries are expected to begin before the end of 2023. Lucid’s shares have fallen nearly 23% from the beginning of 2023 through Monday’s close as concerns about ongoing demand for the Air have lingered. While the Air has received strong reviews and can claim the longest range of any EV currently available in the U.S., it’s expensive. The Air starts at $77,400 in its least-expensive Pure trim, a new single-motor version with 410 miles of range. At the high end, the 1,234-horsepower Sapphire version costs $249,000. Lucid didn’t provide an update to its production guidance for the full year. The company previously told investors that it expects to produce “over 10,000” vehicles in 2023, guidance it first provided in May and reiterated in August. Through the end of September, Lucid produced 6,037 EVs in 2023, not including the units in transit to Saudi Arabia at quarter-end. Lucid had $6.25 billion in available liquidity as of the end of the second quarter, including $5.5 billion in cash and the remainder in available credit lines, which Chief Financial Officer Sherry House said at the time was sufficient to fund the company into 2025. Lucid will report its third-quarter results after the U.S. markets close Nov. 7.  Don’t miss these CNBC PRO stories:",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Johnson & Johnson beats on earnings as medtech, pharmaceutical sales surge","In this article Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday reported adjusted earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street’s expectations, and lifted its full-year guidance as sales in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices businesses surged. It marks J&J’s first quarterly results since it completed the separation from its consumer health spinoff Kenvue in August, the company’s biggest shake-up in its 137-year history. Upon that separation in August, J&J also lowered its full-year sales and profit guidance.  The drugmaker raised that revised outlook on Tuesday: J&J expects 2023 sales of $83.6 billion to $84 billion, compared with previous guidance of $83.2 billion to $84 billion in August. J&J also expects adjusted earnings per share of $10.07 to $10.13, up from a previous forecast of $10.00 to $10.10. J&J also said it recorded a one-time, non-cash gain of $21 billion as part of the split of Kenvue. Here’s what J&J reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: J&J’s stock closed nearly 1% on Tuesday. Shares of J&J have dropped more than 12% for the year, putting the company’s market value at roughly $376 billion. The company, whose financial results are considered a bellwether for the broader health sector, said its sales during the quarter grew 6.8% over the same period last year.  The pharmaceutical giant reported net income of $4.31 billion, or $1.69 per share. That was flat compared with net income of $4.31 billion, or $1.62 per share, for the same period a year ago. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per share were $2.66 for the period. J&J reported $13.89 billion in pharmaceutical sales, which grew more than 5% year over year. Excluding sales of its unpopular Covid vaccine, the pharmaceutical division raked in $13.85 billion.  Wall Street was expecting sales of $13.34 billion for the entire business segment, according to StreetAccount. The business, also known as “Innovative Medicine,” is focused on developing drugs across different disease areas. The company said the growth was driven by sales of Darzalex, a biologic for the treatment of multiple myeloma, along with Erleada, a prostate cancer treatment, and other oncology treatments.  J&J’s blockbuster drug Stelara, which is used to treat a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, also contributed to that growth. J&J will lose patent protection on Stelara later this year.  The company said growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of its prostate cancer drug Zytiga and blood cancer drug Imbruvica, which is co-marketed by AbbVie and will be subject to the first round of Medicare drug price negotiations.  J&J’s Covid vaccine also weighed on pharmaceutical sales growth. This quarter was the second without any U.S. sales from J&J’s Covid vaccine, which brought in $41 million in international revenue. “Our success was never dependent on the Covid vaccine,” J&J CFO Joseph Wolk said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Meanwhile, sales for the company’s medical devices business rose to nearly $7.46 billion, up 10% from the third quarter of 2022. That came in under Wall Street’s expectations of $7.58 billion, according to StreetAccount. J&J said its acquisition of Abiomed, a cardiovascular medical technology company, in December fueled the year-over-year rise. J&J said growth came from electrophysiological products, which evaluate the heart’s electrical system and help doctors understand the cause of abnormal heart rhythms. Wound closure products and devices for orthopedic trauma, or serious injuries of the skeletal or muscular system, contributed, along with contact lenses. The third-quarter results come amid investor anxiety over the thousands of lawsuits claiming that J&J’s talc-based products were contaminated with the carcinogenic asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer and several deaths. Those products, including J&J’s namesake baby powder, now fall under Kenvue. But J&J will assume all talc-related liabilities that arise in the U.S. and Canada. In 2021, J&J offloaded its talc liabilities into a new subsidiary, LTL Management, and immediately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. But a federal bankruptcy judge in July rejected J&J’s second attempt to resolve those lawsuits in bankruptcy. J&J previously said LTL Management intends to appeal the decision. The quarterly results also come as J&J begins price talks with the federal Medicare program over its drug Xarelto, which is used to prevent blood clotting to reduce the risk of stroke. President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022, empowered Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time in the program’s six-decade history. J&J signed an agreement to participate in the price talks last month, even after it sued the Biden administration to halt the process in July. Wolk said during an earnings call Tuesday that J&J submitted all requested information in compliance with the federal government’s negotiation process. But Wolk also reiterated the company’s opposition to the negotiations, “We continue to believe the IRA’s price-setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients as we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by us and others.”",CNBC
Drew Richardson,"Tupperware shares surge after company replaces CEO, shuffles board","In this article Tupperware on Tuesday appointed Laurie Ann Goldman as its new CEO and shook up its board as the iconic brand tries to overcome its recent struggles. Shares of Tupperware closed 8% higher at $2.18 Tuesday. However, the stock is down 47% so far this year, and its market cap is just over $100 million. The company warned investors earlier this year about its ability to survive as a going concern. It has delayed its financial reporting several times this year amid ongoing financial struggles. In an August securities filing, the company said it identified “multiple prior period misstatements and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.” Goldman’s predecessor, Miguel Fernandez, worked just three years as the company’s CEO. The container maker also appointed three new members to its board, with Fernandez departing the board, the company said in a statement. Goldman had previously served as CEO of Avon North America and Spanx. “Now is the right time to bring in new leadership, and Laurie Ann is exceptionally well-suited to advance our long-term strategy and accelerate growth,” said Susan Cameron, Tupperware’s chair.

Diana Olick,"Homebuilder sentiment drops to 10-month low, as mortgage rates soar","Builder confidence in the market for single-family homes dropped to the lowest level since January, as builders contend with a market dominated by high mortgage rates and costs for financing. The monthly National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped 4 points to 40 in October, and September’s read was revised down 1 point. Anything below 50 is considered negative. This marks the third straight monthly decline in builder confidence. Builders point squarely to mortgage rates, which are now at a 23-year high. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has remained over 7% for two months. Affordability has fallen to near record lows. “Builders have reported lower levels of buyer traffic, as some buyers, particularly younger ones, are priced out of the market because of higher interest rates,” said Alicia Huey, NAHB’s chairman and a homebuilder and developer from Birmingham, Alabama. “Higher rates are also increasing the cost and availability of builder development and construction loans, which harms supply and contributes to lower housing affordability.” Of the index’s three components, current sales conditions fell 4 points to 46, sales expectations in the next six months dropped 5 points to 44, and buyer traffic dropped 4 points to 26. In order to get buyers in the door, builders are using more incentives again. This includes buying down mortgage interest rates. About 62% of builders reported offering sales incentives of all forms in October, up from 59% in September and tied with the previous high for this cycle set in December 2022. In addition, 32% of builders said they cut home prices. That is unchanged from the previous month but still the highest rate since December (35%). The average price discount is steady at 6%. “The housing affordability crisis can only be solved by adding additional attainable, affordable supply,” said Robert Dietz, NAHB’s chief economist. “Boosting housing production would help reduce the shelter inflation component that was responsible for more than half of the overall Consumer Price Index increase in September and aid the Fed’s mission to bring inflation back down to 2%.  However, uncertainty regarding monetary policy is contributing to affordability challenges in the market.” Regionally, on a three-month moving average, builder sentiment in the Northeast fell 4 points to 50 and in the Midwest dropped 3 points to 39. In the South it fell 5 points to 49, and in the West it fell 6 points to 41. Don’t miss these CNBC PRO stories:",CNBC
Hugh Son,Bank of America tops profit estimates on better-than-expected interest income,"In this article Bank of America topped estimates for third-quarter profit on Tuesday on stronger-than-expected interest income. Here’s what the company reported: Profit rose 10% to $7.8 billion, or 90 cents per share, from $7.1 billion, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said in a release. Revenue climbed 2.9% to $25.32 billion, edging out the LSEG estimate. Bank of America said interest income rose 4% to $14.4 billion, roughly $300 million more than analysts had anticipated, fueled by higher rates and loan growth. The bank’s provision for credit losses also came in better than expected, at $1.2 billion, under the $1.3 billion estimate. Shares of Bank of America closed more than 2% higher Tuesday. The results show Bank of America avoided major pitfalls related to loan losses and higher rates, analyst Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo wrote in a note. He called it an “okay quarter” that fell short of JPMorgan and Citigroup’s results. CEO Brian Moynihan said the second biggest U.S. bank by assets continued to grow, despite signs of an economic slowdown. “We added clients and accounts across all lines of business,” Moynihan said. “We did this in a healthy but slowing economy that saw U.S. consumer spending still ahead of last year but continuing to slow.” Bank of America was supposed to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of higher interest rates this year. Instead, the company’s stock has been the worst performer among its big bank peers in 2023. That’s because, under Moynihan, the lender piled into low-yielding, long-dated securities during the Covid pandemic. Those securities lost value as interest rates climbed. That’s made Bank of America more sensitive to the recent surge in the 10-year Treasury yield than its peers — and more similar to some regional banks that are also nursing underwater bonds. Unrealized losses at the lender deepened in the quarter, reaching $131 billion on its portfolio of held-to-maturity bonds. Most of the losses were tied to mortgage securities. “Clearly, this held-to-maturity portfolio has been a thorn in the side of the stock,” UBS analyst Erika Najarian said during Tuesday’s conference call as she prodded management for more details on the bank. The situation has pressured the bank’s net interest income, or NII, which is a key metric that analysts will be watching this quarter. In July, the bank’s CFO, Alastair Borthwick, affirmed previous guidance that NII would be roughly $57 billion for 2023. On Tuesday, Borthwick told analysts that the “good news” on net interest income is that it will trough in the fourth quarter and begin to grow again in the middle of 2024.   Bank of America stock had fallen 18% this year through Monday, trailing the 10% gain of rival JPMorgan Chase . Last week, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each topped expectations for third-quarter profit, helped by better-than-expected credit costs. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to post results Wednesday.

Laya Neelakandan,StubHub sees 60% jump in ticket sales for NBA season as global interest surges,"With the National Basketball Association season tipping off next week, StubHub sees ticket sales up nearly 60% compared to last year, with the Los Angeles Lakers returning to the top of the list as the most in-demand team. The ticket exchange’s annual NBA preview breaks down the company’s projections for the upcoming basketball season based on years of data, according to spokesperson Adam Budelli. The season kicks off Oct. 24. Across the board, Budelli told CNBC that all teams are seeing an encouraging rise in demand this season, with international interest surging. Fans from 92 countries — up 24 from last season — are flocking to North American games, he said. Those international sales will be up 120% from last season, StubHub predicted, with the most popular countries attending NBA games including Australia, the United Kingdom and Brazil. “It’s hard to pinpoint one specific factor, but I would say across live events as a whole, we certainly have seen cross-border travel for live events increased and rebound to a higher point than when it was pre-pandemic,” Budelli said. The NBA has been increasingly dominated by international stars such as the Denver Nuggets’ Nikola Jokić, the Milwaukee Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo and San Antonio Spurs rookie Victor Wembanyama. The league’s international reach, likewise, will likely factor into its upcoming media rights negotiations. Budelli said the Lakers, which features superstars LeBron James and Anthony Davis, have been the top team in StubHub’s projections four times since 2017. One notable absence in the list, however, is last season’s NBA champion the Denver Nuggets, which Budelli said the company is monitoring and expects to rise in popularity as the season progresses. He also noted that ticket sales more than doubled after Damian Lillard was traded to the already-potent Milwaukee Bucks on Sept. 27, with the team’s home opener expected to be the highest selling game of the season. Budelli said Lillard’s trade is likely “the biggest mover” of the season, pushing the team up six spots on the list compared to last year. On the road, the Golden State Warriors, who added star guard Chris Paul to their high-scoring lineup, have the highest average ticket price for their away game schedule, StubHub said. Budelli said the Knicks host five of the projected top 10 most popular games, more than any other team, as they just barely inch behind the Lakers as the top team. The Knicks have outpaced their sales from last season by 80%, according to StubHub. Still, Budelli said the projections are subject to change, and StubHub is excited to monitor how the teams — and players — shake out as the season progresses. “It definitely has the usual suspects on top, but as it goes, that can fluctuate and move throughout the season,” Budelli said. “And there’s star players that break out and rookies and things like that, but it’s all there, and I think those trends speak for themselves.”",CNBC
Michael Wayland,"In rare move, Ford executive chair calls on UAW to make a deal","In this article DEARBORN, Mich. – Ford Motor Executive Chair Bill Ford on Monday warned that an ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers threatens the future livelihood of the company as well as the American automotive industry. Ford, who has been a part of UAW negotiations since 1982, pleaded with union members and leaders to work with the company, instead of against it, to reach a tentative deal to “end to this acrimonious round of talks.” Such comments by the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford are uncharacteristic during contract talks with the UAW. “We are at a crossroads,” Ford said during a news conference at the company’s massive Rouge Complex in metro Detroit. “Choosing the right path is not just about Ford’s future and our ability to compete. This is about the future of the American automobile industry.” Ford, ahead of speaking on stage, told reporters he wanted to “elevate” the conversation about the contract negotiations. Ford said he didn’t want to get personal in his remarks because “it doesn’t matter” at this point. “The UAW’s leaders have called us the enemy in these negotiations. But I will never consider our employees as enemies. This should not be Ford versus the UAW,” Ford said. “It should be Ford and the UAW vs. Toyota and Honda, Tesla, and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home.” UAW President Shawn Fain countered Ford’s plea by ratcheting up the pressure. “Bill Ford knows exactly how to settle this strike. Instead of threatening to close the Rouge, he should call up [Ford CEO] Jim Farley, tell him to stop playing games and get a deal done, or we’ll close the Rouge for him,” he said in a statement. “It’s not the UAW and Ford against foreign automakers. It’s autoworkers everywhere against corporate greed. If Ford wants to be the all-American auto company, they can pay all-American wages and benefits. Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy — they’re the UAW members of the future.” Ford did not threaten to close the Rouge Complex in his remarks. He did mention if American carmakers such as Ford lose to the competition, then jobs, future investments and “factories like the one we are in today” will be lost. Ford’s remarks come after a week of contentious talks between the company and the UAW, including the union unexpectedly announcing a strike Wednesday night at the company’s highly profitable Kentucky Truck Plant. More than 19,000 of Ford’s 57,000 UAW members are currently impacted by the strike, including more than 16,600 striking workers. Another roughly 2,480 employees have been laid off as a result of the work stoppage. Ford last week said it was “at the limit” of what it can offer the UAW in terms of economic concessions. The company’s most recent proposal included 23% to 26% wage increases depending on classification; retention of platinum health-care benefits; ratification bonuses; reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments; and other benefits. Overall, only about 34,000 U.S. autoworkers with the companies – or roughly 23% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers – are currently on strike. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. Fain last week said the union has entered a “new phase” of the targeted strikes in which it would no longer pre-announce the work stoppages, as it had been. Fain has said it’s ultimately up to the members to decide when the strike ends, not UAW leadership. Opinions of the strike and current contract proposals varied on picket lines Monday outside Ford’s nearby Michigan Assembly Plant, which was the first of three facilities to go on strike last month. “I trust Shawn Fain,” said Latosha Smith, a four-year worker at the plant. “All the steps he’s taken, it’s for the cause.” Tamika Genus, a worker at the plant for roughly five years, said of course she’d like it to come to a resolution, but “it’s worth it.” She later added, “We’re doing what we’ve got to do.” Jeff Nichol, a body shop worker at the plant who was laid off due to the strike, said he wishes that the sides “would come to a conclusion a lot sooner than later.” He also would like union leaders to be more transparent regarding exact details of the company’s proposals. Nichol, who’s been autoworker for over 11 years, said he knows it’s an “unpopular opinion,” but he’d support Ford’s current proposal, including a 23% wage increase. “What I’ve been getting is good enough, so any little bit of extra does help, especially with the current economy,” he said. “The way I look at it, too, is the amount of time that we’re off, that also plays into how long it’s going to take for us to make a difference for the amount of money that we lose every single week.” Ford said Friday employees who have been on strike since Sept. 15 have on average lost about $4,000 in pretax income through four weeks of the strike. Correction: Only about 34,000 U.S. autoworkers with the companies are currently on strike. An earlier version mischaracterized the figure.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Taylor Swift Eras Tour film posts second-best October opening weekend,"In this article Taylor Swift and AMC have collected the receipts and results are in: the Eras Tour concert film is the second-highest domestic opener of October ever. The film tallied $92.8 million during its first three days in theaters, falling shy of AMC’s expectations, which forecasted a $95 million to $97 million haul, and box office analysts’ calls for a $100 million-plus opening. Still, Swift’s theatrical debut is an enormous success, given its genre and the limits of its release. The Eras Tour concert film has already shattered records and is likely to break a few more before its run is done. Box office analysts admitted that their predictions were lofty, but told CNBC that the film was a “unicorn” in the theatrical world. No concert film had ever elicited such fervor so quickly for ticket sales or drummed up so much demand with theater chains. There was also the base price for tickets, which were 40% higher than traditional movie releases. Experts suggested the film could see a bigger bump in overall box office. But, the film also had some headwinds to contend with. Thursday previews weren’t announced until less than a day before tickets would be made available, and Friday showings didn’t start until 6 p.m. local time. This meant that many audience members had likely already secured tickets to see the film later in the weekend, and the film missed out on the business that early showings Friday could have generated. So, the Eras Tour film snared just $2.8 million in last-minute Thursday night previews for a total of $37.5 million on its opening day. Meanwhile, the highest October opening, Warner Bros.′ “Joker” from 2019, secured $13.3 million from Thursday previews, feeding a $39.3 million opening day. For the whole weekend, “Joker” scored $96.2 million domestically. The third-highest October opening was Sony’s “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” from 2021, which snared $11.6 million from Thursday night previews leading to a $37.4 million opening Friday. Additionally, while Swift’s film arrived in 3,855 theaters, the most for any concert film, “Joker” opened in nearly 4,400 locations, according to data from Comscore. “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” opened in 4,225 locations. Going forward, comparisons between Swift’s film and other releases will be difficult, since the Eras Tour is doing weekend-only engagements. This also makes predicting the film’s second week drop difficult, as there are no close concert film comparisons and it’s unclear how the lack of mid-week showings could impact foot traffic on the next weekend. Typically, blockbuster-style releases drop between 50% and 70% in their second weekend. The Eras Tour’s theatrical run is scheduled to end Nov. 5. AMC reported that the Eras Tour concert film tallied $123.5 million globally, putting it on pace to top the $262.5 million international haul of 2009′s “Michael Jackson’s This Is It.”",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,"Space investors followed government contracts in the third quarter, report says","Investment in the space sector, especially from venture capital, is consistently flowing into companies that are pursuing and winning government contracts, according to a report Monday by New York-based Space Capital. “In this market – 21 months into this liquidity crunch – people are chasing government dollars. They’re more willing to chase government dollars and infrastructure companies have line of sight to a lot of that,” Space Capital managing partner Chad Anderson told CNBC. The firm’s third quarter report found that space infrastructure companies brought in $1.6 billion of private investment during the third quarter. That brings the sector to $8.4 billion in investment year-to-date, surpassing the total $8.3 billion invested in 2022. The quarterly Space Capital report divides investment in the industry into three technology categories: infrastructure, distribution and application. Infrastructure includes what would be commonly considered as space companies, such as firms that build rockets and satellites. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. Anderson noted that “the infrastructure companies have been pretty resilient through market cycles,” a factor he attributed to “higher competitive moats” such as higher capital needs, longer development timelines and significant intellectual property advantages. Venture capital accounted for 50% of the third quarter’s investment in space infrastructure, tracking with the historical trend of VCs representing the primary contributors to space investment.  Space Capital highlighted the trend of companies and investors chasing government funds as apparent in sub-sectors within space infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets such as space stations and the moon. “You look at emerging industries – these are all government-led markets. So it’s actually quite easy to size up the market – you know how many dollars are available, how big the market is currently and how big it’s going to be over the next few years – because you already know what the government budgets are,” Anderson said. Space Capital found that “the majority of private investment has preferred” space stations among the sector’s emerging markets “when, in actuality, Lunar and Logistics are significantly larger markets.” “The amount of money that’s going to space stations is chasing a very small amount of government dollars, and the amount of money going into lunar is very small, and it’s chasing a whole lot more government dollars,” Anderson said.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,Hollywood’s AI issues are far from settled after writers’ labor deal with studios,"The Writers Guild of America’s labor deal with Hollywood studios was billed as a big win for writers, but industry experts fear the agreement’s artificial intelligence guardrails won’t be enough. As it stands, the industry faces several questions about AI and writing now that the deal is ratified, particularly about copyright law, detection of AI usage and how studios will behave. AI also remains a major sticking point in the ongoing actors’ strike as talks broke down on Thursday in part due to a disagreement on AI guardrails between actors and studios. Writers and actors have long feared the increasing prominence of AI, primarily due to concerns that the technology could replace the need for them in Hollywood. “I hope I’m wrong, but I do think that the use of AI is going to take over the entertainment industry,” Justine Bateman, a member of the writers, directors and actors guilds, told CNBC in July. The WGA agreement established that AI cannot be used to undermine a writer’s credit or be used as a means to reduce a writer’s compensation. The contract does, however, leave room for studios to train AI using preexisting material. WGA’s original May proposal, which triggered the strike, would have disallowed studios from using any materials to train AI outright. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment. Hollywood studios training AI with preexisting materials could create a whole new set of issues for writers by allowing the studios to use previous work to generate similar materials without the writer’s consent or even awareness. It is in this gray area that thorny issues could sprout, according to Lisa Callif, partner at Beverly Hills entertainment law firm Donaldson Callif Perez LLP. “One of the biggest issues we’re dealing with is the misappropriation of how AI uses source material and creates new material out of it without permission,” Callif said. “How do you control this? I think it really comes down to human behavior.” Allowing studios to train AI with preexisting material was a “punt” down the line, and studios will inevitably “push to use AI as far as possible,” said Peter Csathy, founder and chairman of media legal advisory company Creative Media. “The biggest inhibitor is probably existing copyright law,” he said. AI has upended traditional copyright law in the U.S. Prominent authors, including Jodi Picoult and George R.R. Martin, sued OpenAI earlier this year for copyright infringement, accusing the startup of using their published works to train ChatGPT. “We’re having productive conversations with many creators around the world, including the Authors Guild, and have been working cooperatively to understand and discuss their concerns about AI,” a spokesperson for OpenAI told ABC News. In January, a group of visual artists sued Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt, arguing that Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion software scraped billions of copyrighted images from the internet without licensure and allowed Midjourney and DeviantArt AI tools to generate images in the artists’ style. In the United States, non-human-generated content is not eligible for copyright, which presents challenges for studios wishing to utilize AI. “It’s clear from the U.S. copyright laws that AI-generated content is not capable of protection or exclusivity, and the studios will not have that,” Csathy said. “They need to own their intellectual property.” Accusations of copyright infringement have have long relied on the general principle of substantial similarity. In other words, if one body of work is found to be substantially similar to an earlier body of work, the original artist would be entitled to compensation. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that photographer Lynn Goldsmith’s pictures taken of late pop superstar Prince were entitled to copyright protection after artist Andy Warhol, who died in 1987, used one of her unlicensed photographs as a starting point to add his signature bold and colorful style. After Prince’s death in 2016, Vanity Fair licensed one of Warhol’s images created using Goldsmith’s original photograph without compensating Goldsmith in any form. The ruling has particular applicability to writers, Csathy said. “In the case [of using AI], if there’s substantial similarity to an existing script and it takes a commercial opportunity away, they could claim copyright infringement and cite the Warhol case,” Csathy said. AI regulation is notoriously minimal given how quickly the technology evolves. But some, like Csathy, say that detection and guardrail technology is advancing. Intel Labs is behind the development of “My Art My Choice,” an initiative that aims to protect copyrighted works from being used in AI learning. The technology works by adding a protective layer over an image that makes the image unusable by an AI learning model. The team plans to apply the technology to other modalities in the future. Earlier this month, machine learning company HuggingFace announced a collaboration with media verification company Truepic to embed a digital “watermark” into images to easily identify authorship, edits and label AI-generated content. The advancements are reminiscent of digital fingerprinting tool Content ID, which quelled fears that YouTube would thwart copyright regulations in its early days. The tool, introduced in 2007, has since been scaled to detect copyright infringements on a massive scale. Content ID flagged more than 826 million possible copyright violations in the second half of 2022, nearly all automatically, according to a July YouTube Transparency Report. The claims generated $9 billion in payouts to rights holders. “The technology is increasing on the detection side,” Csathy said. “There’s a whole burgeoning industry of forensic AI that’s going to be policing this.” Despite strides being made in content verification and AI detection technology, many are still not convinced that this will be enough contain the risks of AI. “The courts will say there are hundreds of thousands or millions of works in the training set,” Csathy said. The courts will ask “so how can you possibly say that there was an infringement and not a fair use of your works? It’s going to be constant push and pull. There’s no way to regulate this technology perfectly.” Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.

Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Rite Aid files for bankruptcy amid slowing sales, opioid litigation","In this article Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey on Sunday and said it would begin restructuring to significantly reduce its debt. The company said it reached a deal with creditors on a restructuring plan that includes evaluating its retail footprint and closing underperforming locations. Rite Aid also said lenders agreed to extend $3.45 billion in new funding to “provide sufficient liquidity” as it embarks on its restructuring plan. The beleaguered drugstore chain has been grappling with slowing sales, mounting debt and a slew of lawsuits that allege the company helped fuel the nation’s opioid epidemic by oversupplying painkillers.  During its most recent quarter ended June 3, revenue fell to $5.65 billion, down from $6.01 billion in the year-ago period. Its net loss widened to $306.7 million, or $5.56 per share, compared with a net loss of $110.2 million, or $2.03 per share, in the same period a year earlier.  As a result of the rough quarter, Rite Aid lowered its fiscal 2024 outlook and warned investors it expects to lose between $650 million and $680 million for the full year, which is slated to end in late February. Rite Aid’s retail pharmacy segment has long been a key growth driver for the company, but that hasn’t been enough to offset its mounting losses. Plummeting demand for Covid vaccines and testing, a membership reduction in the company’s prescription drug plan, and a loss of customers from its Elixir pharmacy benefits business have contributed to a slowdown in revenue at the struggling drug chain. On Sunday, the company appointed Jeffrey Stein as its new chief executive officer and chief restructuring officer as well as a member of its board. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as interim CEO since January and will remain on the company’s board. Rite Aid Chairman Bruce Bodaken said in a statement: “Jeff is a proven leader with a strong track record of guiding companies through financial restructurings. We look forward to benefitting from his contributions and leveraging his expertise as we strengthen Rite Aid’s foundation and position the business for long-term success.” Stein said he has “tremendous confidence in this business and the turnaround strategy that has been developed in recent months.” Drugstores like Rite Aid have faced an existential crisis as shoppers increasingly turn to retailers like Amazon , Target , Walmart and others for toothpaste, shampoo and other staples — often at a cheaper price and with the convenience of delivery to customers’ doors. Rite Aid has also struggled to keep up with its bigger rivals, CVS and Walgreens , as those companies have pivoted to a health-care focus and made sizable investments to match. CVS has opened in-store Minute Clinics, which resemble walk-in urgent-care facilities, and turned more of its stores into HealthHubs, or locations with a longer list of medical services.  It has expanded its reach in health care by acquiring Caremark, one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers, health insurer Aetna and, most recently, primary-care company Oak Street Health. Walgreens has also struck pricey deals to expand its reach in health care. It’s become the majority owner of primary-care company VillageMD and plans to open up doctor offices next to many of its drugstores.  Newer — and well-capitalized — health-care entrants have also intensified the competitive threat. Amazon closed its acquisition of primary-care provider One Medical in a $3.9 billion deal earlier this year and acquired online pharmacy PillPack in 2018. Walmart, which has pharmacies in its thousands of stores, has opened a growing network of medical clinics in parts of the country. Rite Aid’s financial position and competitive disadvantages are compounded by the many lawsuits it’s facing that allege the company contributed to the nation’s opioid epidemic by knowingly filling prescriptions for painkillers that did not meet legal requirements. The Department of Justice filed a suit against Rite Aid earlier this year, claiming that it violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling thousands of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances such as fentanyl and oxycodone. Rite Aid has asked a court to dismiss the department’s lawsuit and denied allegations it filled unlawful opioid prescriptions. — CNBC’s Christine Wang contributed to this report.",CNBC
Laya Neelakandan,An Absolut Vodka and Sprite canned cocktail is coming next year,"In this article Coca-Cola is teaming up with Pernod Ricard to launch a new ready-to-drink and premixed cocktail beginning 2024, the companies announced Monday. The new cocktail will contain a mix of Absolut Vodka and Sprite, the companies said. The drink will be available in two versions with Sprite and Sprite Zero Sugar. The debut is planned for early next year in select European countries including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany. The canned cocktail industry has been growing in popularity in the past couple of years, with a 2022 report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. finding ready-to-drink beverages to be the fastest-growing spirits category in both revenue and volume. The announcement didn’t say when the Absolut and Sprite drinks would hit the U.S. market. The new drinks join a host of expanding alcoholic beverages in Coke’s portfolio in the past few years, including last year’s Jack-and-Coke cocktail in a can. “We are expanding in the alcohol ready-to-drink space, including products that use select brands from our core portfolio,” said James Quincey, CEO and chair of Coca-Cola, in a statement. “We are excited about our new relationship with Pernod Ricard and look forward to the introduction of Absolut & Sprite.” Vodka is already one of the most popular bases for alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, and lemon-lime soft drinks such as Sprite are one of the most popular mixers in premixed cocktails.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Taylor Swift Eras Tour is the highest-grossing domestic concert film ever,"In this article Box office analysts became Swifties in the lead-up to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert film release, estimating blockbuster-style opening weekend numbers. And Swift delivered. While the pop singer fell short of the $100 million benchmark, domestic ticket sales still topped $95 million, according to distributor AMC Entertainment. The theater chain provided a range of $95 million to $97 million for the film’s opening weekend on Sunday, with expectations that an official figure will be provided on Monday once all tickets have been tallied. “The film’s debut is an undeniable tentpole-level success despite the challenges of predicting what it might achieve,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “Swift, her fans, and theatrical exhibition should all be celebrating the results.” Already, the film has shattered records, becoming the highest-grossing concert film release domestically, surpassing Justin Beiber’s “Never Say Never” film release, which hauled in $73 million over the course of its run in theaters in 2011, in a single weekend. And it easily beat Miley Cyrus’ “Best of Both Worlds” record opening of $31.1 million from 2008. Swift’s Eras Tour film is also the widest-released concert film in history, arriving in more than 3,850 domestic locations during its debut. Monday’s official tally will unveil if Swift was able to capture the highest opening of October, currently held by 2019′s “The Joker” ($96.2 million), and if it is the sixth or seventh-highest opening of 2023. Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” secured $95.6 million when it opened in May. There’s also a possibility that word of mouth and fan’s love of Swift could send more moviegoers to theaters on Sunday, pushing it closer to that $100 million figure. “As cautioned in recent weeks, forecasts were always going to be incredibly volatile given the highly unique nature of this release,” Robbins said. “Variables such as average ticket price, assessing how frontloaded Swift’s fan base would make the film’s presales, and whether or not any traditional marketing would bring out non-Swifties all weighed heavily on the wide range of possible outcomes.” Initially, expectations said Swift could tally between $40 million and $60 million on Friday, on her way to an opening weekend draw of as much as $150 million. The film scored $39 million on Friday, just shy of the forecasted range and included $2.8 million from last-minute Thursday night previews, which were announced less than 24 hours before they were available for purchase. “Swift’s excitement-inducing reputation and the unprecedented nature of the release led to a massive outpouring of interest in the film certainly contributed to some overblown expectations of a $100 million plus weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “But that should not detract from the enormity of this box office achievement.” A whopping 60% of tickets for the weekend were bought in advance, according to data from EntTelligence, one of the highest rates the movie data firm has ever seen. Typically, big tentpoles see 40% of tickets sold ahead of time. Around 4.8 million people were estimated to have attended the film over the weekend, with an average ticket price of $20.75, EntTelligence reported. Nearly 80% of the audience was female. International box office figures were not immediately available on Sunday, but with a solid domestic opening, expectations are high that the film can surpass the $262.5 million global haul of “Michael Jackson’s This Is It” during its limited run in theaters. Swift’s film has weekend-only engagements in theaters, instead of daily screenings, so comparisons to other releases will be difficult in the coming weeks, but weekend-to-weekend figures will be comparable. “The question now is what the Swift film will do for an encore in the coming days and weeks,” Dergarabedian said. “Reports of a spectacular in-theater experience bodes well for the long-term playability of the film and guarantees the film will easily eclipse the $100 million mark in the domestic market.”",CNBC
Amelia Lucas,Halloween is candy’s biggest holiday. Here’s how Snickers maker Mars prepares,"In this article For 11 months of the year, Tim LeBel is Mars Wrigley’s president of sales. But for the month of October, he dons a new title: chief Halloween officer. For decades, the fall holiday has been the biggest day of the year for candy makers. In recent years, Halloween has also stretched to become a three-month season for Mars and rivals such as Hershey , Ferrero and Mondelez , and the retailers who stock their candy. The National Retail Federation predicts consumers will spend $3.6 billion on Halloween candy this year, up from $3.1 billion last year, even as many shoppers pull back spending elsewhere. “We know that during difficult economic times, consumers are particularly interested in enjoying kind of the simple things in life … like Halloween,” Hershey CEO Michele Buck told investors in July on the company’s quarterly conference call. Unlike Hershey, family-owned Mars doesn’t report its financial results, but disclosed nearly $45 billion in annual revenue in 2021. While best known for a candy portfolio that includes M&M’s, Snickers, Three Musketeers and Twix, Mars also makes ice cream, chewing gum and pet food. With the stakes so high for Halloween, Mars starts planning for the holiday two years in advance. LeBel said he sits down with key retailers to discuss trends across flavors, packaging and sustainability. “A lot of those things take two years to develop and execute to bring to market,” LeBel told CNBC. “So the things we looked at in 2021, you’re starting to see this year in 2023.” That’s phase one of planning. The next stage happens in the three weeks of November after last Halloween. Mars once again sits down with retailers, this time for a post mortem on its candies’ performance. “What items did we not make enough of? What items maybe went off trend?” LeBel said. This year, Mars has a couple of tricks up its sleeve, such as Skittles Shriekers. Each bag includes classic Skittles with a few sour-flavored ones that look the same as the rest of the bag. The company is also leaning into online shopping. Last year, roughly a third of consumers bought Halloween items online. This year, Mars has teamed up with digital convenience store Gopuff to make sure everyone has enough candy to pass out on Halloween. Consumers whose stash is running low can visit MMsHalloweenRescueSquad.com and receive a delivery of a free backup supply of Mars candy in under an hour in participating locations, while supplies last. But Mars’ Halloween plans will always include the classics, such as its Snickers bars, which are the second best-selling Halloween candy, trailing only Hershey’s Reese’s cups. Three of Mars’ variety bags cracked the top 10 for most popular assortments, according to the company. Retailers’ insights may lead Mars to pivot its plans for the next Halloween season, which starts just nine months later, before temperatures cool and pumpkin spice lattes return to Starbucks’ menu. ″[Retailers] realize that having our portfolio on display from August through October captures multiple consumer occasions,” LeBel said. Those moments include picking up a variety pack of candy during back-to-school shopping, snacking during spooky movie nights and the all-important trick-or-treating on Halloween. Still, 48% of Halloween candy sales happen during the last week of October, according to LeBel. Those last-minute shoppers mean that candy manufacturers and retailers need to be ready to meet that demand. All of Mars’ planning has paid off this year. The company exceeded its production targets this Halloween season. “I actually still have some in our warehouses, ready to ship,” LeBel said. Correction: This article has been updated to correct the link to Mars’ collaboration with Gopuff.",CNBC
John Rosevear,What to make of the UAW’s shifting strike tactics after the latest escalation,"In this article DETROIT – A shift in strategy by the United Auto Workers union this week has some analysts wondering if the parties are — perhaps, counterintuitively — getting closer to a deal. On Wednesday the union initiated a surprise work stoppage at Ford Motor’s Kentucky Truck Plant. The strike involves 8,700 workers and affects the most crucial plant, by far – responsible for $25 billion in revenue annually – that the union has walked out on since the strikes began Sept. 15. It’s expected to quickly have a ripple effect on other Ford plants and suppliers. It also ushered in what UAW President Shawn Fain characterized as a “new phase” of strikes and contract negotiations with Ford, General Motors and Chrysler-parent Stellantis , giving the union the element of surprise to keep the automakers on edge during the ongoing negotiations, Fain told members in a Friday presentation. “We’re entering a new phase of this fight and it demands a new approach,” Fain said Friday. “We’re done waiting until Fridays to escalate our strike. “We are prepared at any time to call on more locals to stand up and walk out,” he said. Until this week, Fain had announced all of the union’s new strikes on Fridays, during what has become a weekly livestreamed update for union members. Some Wall Street analysts and industry experts think this week’s shift in strategy could be a sign that UAW leaders feel a deal with Ford is close, and that they’re increasing pressure as a tactic to get the deal over the finish line — and to help sell a potential tentative deal to their members. “We continue to believe the escalation at [Ford] this week is a sign the talks may be coming to an end. KY Truck is likely Ford’s most profitable plant, and therefore the strike is the highest level of escalation, aside from a national strike,” Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a Friday note. “This escalation would likely be done to push for final terms.” But the UAW’s leaders may be looking one more step ahead, to the process of selling a tentative deal with Ford to their members. The thinking is that to convince members to ratify a potential new contract, UAW President Shawn Fain and the union’s leadership will need to convince autoworkers that the union has fought as hard as possible to have their demands met. Striking Ford’s most profitable factory might be one way to do that. Wolfe Research’s Rod Lache argued the Kentucky strike may allow UAW leadership to claim that they did all that could be done, especially if it leads to one or two more concessions from Ford. “In another week or two, Fain should be able to credibly announce that he has forced Ford into one last capitulation (battery plants?), and that UAW members have secured the last few ounces of wage, benefits, and job protection concessions that they can get,” Lache wrote Thursday to investors. Only about 34,000 U.S. automakers with the companies, or roughly 23% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike. “Hitting a very high-dollar, high-profitable plant, it certainly gets Ford’s attention very quickly,” said Art Wheaton, a labor professor at the Worker Institute at Cornell University. “It also sends a huge message to Stellantis and General Motors.” Wheaton argues the escalation in Kentucky may just be the beginning. There are plenty more plants the union could hit for each of the automakers, including the full-size pickup truck plants owned by all three and large SUV plants at GM and Stellantis. GM avoided a strike at its most profitable SUV plant in Texas last week with a last-minute offer to include battery cell plant workers under the company’s national agreement, however details regarding how that will be done are believed to be still being negotiated. While Fain declined to expand strikes against GM and Stellantis Friday, Wells Fargo’s Langan thinks that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re spared. “The lack of GM & STLA strike today, even though both have not matched F’s offer, would be consistent with the UAW holding out the most profitable plants for a final push,” he wrote in a Friday note. All of that tea-leaf reading aside, rapid escalation-turned-resolution is just one potential outcome. Another includes the automakers holding out for the union to deplete its resources, specifically its strike and defense fund. Or, the UAW could continue rotating strikes or filing additional unfair labor practice charges against the companies. Yet another outcome could see the sides seeking mediation or legal resources. “I think they’ve got to be getting close to some sort of an agreement, or you just have to conclude a reasonable deal is not in the making — and that this is really more a matter of a test of will than anything else,” said Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who specializes in labor issues. An automaker also could submit what’s known as a “last, best and final offer,” which, as it states, is typically a final proposal when bargainers have reached an impasse. Ford may be close to that point. An executive said Thursday the automaker was “at the limit” of what it can offer UAW in terms of economic concessions. The Detroit automakers have largely given into many of the union’s demands, but not all of them. The companies haven’t waved the white flag on demands for a 32-hour workweek — which was always a nonstarter for the companies and which has largely fallen out of union talking points — and a 40% wage increase. Ford was up to a record 23% wage increase in its recent contract proposal, with the others not far behind. Then there’s the outstanding issues of benefits for retirees as well as a return to traditional pension plans and future battery plant jobs and workers. Industry experts and sources familiar with the talks believe regardless of the outcome, the contracts will have ripple effects on the companies potentially in the way of reorganizations, cost cuts and future investments and jobs. A former high-ranking bargainer for one of the automakers told CNBC that it’s nearly guaranteed that the companies will cut union jobs through product allocation, plant closures or other means to offset increased labor costs once the contracts are set. “They’re going to have to pay up. The question is how much,” said the longtime bargainer, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. “This ends up with fewer jobs. That’s how the automakers cut costs.”",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Pharmacy staff from Walgreens, other chains could stage another walkout","In this article Pharmacy staff from Walgreens are laying the groundwork for a nationwide walkout and multiple rallies at the end of October to protest unsatisfactory working conditions, and are in talks with employees from other retail pharmacies about joining them, CNBC has learned. Those efforts, which are still in the planning stages, reflect the growing discontent among retail pharmacy staff, who have complained for years about having to grapple with understaffed teams and increasing work expectations imposed by corporate management. The Covid pandemic only exacerbated those issues, as new duties like testing and vaccination stretched pharmacists and technicians even thinner.  Those frustrations came to a head in recent weeks, as some pharmacy staff from Walgreens locations around the country and CVS stores in the Kansas City area engaged in separate walkouts. Those demonstrations – and the planning for a broader work stoppage – add to what has been one of the most active years for the labor movement in recent U.S. history. A Walgreens organizer, an employee of the chain who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said the walkouts are scheduled for Oct. 30 to Nov. 1. Another organizer named Shane Jerominski, an independent pharmacist who used to work for Walgreens, confirmed those dates. Jerominski is a pharmacy labor advocate who has been actively involved in organizing recent walkouts.  The Walgreens organizer said they have been in talks with pharmacy staff from other retail chains about participating in the group walkout. The person sees nationwide walkouts across several retail pharmacy chains as the “next step” in the fight against current working conditions. A Walgreens spokesperson redirected CNBC to the company’s earlier statement in response to the walkouts pharmacy staff held this week. The spokesperson touted the company’s pharmacy teams in that statement, noting that they work “tirelessly to serve our communities” at nearly 9,000 store locations across the U.S. The spokesperson also acknowledged that the “last few years have required an unprecedented effort from our team members.” Walgreens is engaged and listening to the concerns of pharmacy staff, the spokesperson said in the statement. In particular, the company said it has been making significant investments in wages and hiring bonuses in order to retain pharmacists in hard-to-staff locations. Walgreens pharmacists make $57.45 an hour on average, according to employment website Indeed. The company has more than 86,000 health-care service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and other health-related professionals. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians work under the company’s U.S. retail pharmacy segment. That division contributes the most sales by far of its business segments, raking in $110 billion in fiscal year 2023. A CVS employee, who was the main organizer of the Kansas City area walkouts, confirmed that they have been in contact with the Walgreens organizer about getting the CVS pharmacy staff they represent to join the nationwide effort. That employee, who also asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, represents CVS pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in the Kansas City area. But the CVS employee said whether those employees join will depend on the outcome of a meeting the person has with Prem Shah, the company’s chief pharmacy officer and president of pharmacy and consumer wellness, on Friday. During that meeting, the employee will assess what CVS has done so far to execute a series of changes it committed to – including adding staff and paid overtime – after the Kansas City area walkouts ended last month.  The CVS employee said if the meeting goes poorly, the person will reach out to the Walgreens organizer and tell them that the pharmacy staff they represent will be “100% behind” the nationwide walkout effort. A CVS spokesperson said the company is “not seeing any unusual activity” regarding unplanned pharmacy closures or pharmacist walkouts. The spokesperson added that the company is working with pharmacists to directly address any concerns they might have.   Pharmacy staff participating in the nationwide effort would also hold demonstrations outside the stores that workers walk out of, according to the people who spoke to CNBC. Jerominksi said organizers are planning to hold rallies in areas that will see the “largest scale” of participation in the walkout, but no specific store locations have been finalized. He added that rallies were the biggest thing that was missing from the recent Walgreens and CVS walkouts.  In addition to those rallies and the walkouts, Jerominski and the Walgreens organizer said they are considering pushing for unionization for pharmacy staff not currently represented by one. The vast majority of pharmacists and technicians from Walgreens and CVS have no union representation, while pharmacy staff from a handful of grocery retailers such as Kroger do, according to Jerominski.  Organizers are in talks with multiple existing unions, but there is no concrete agreement yet, according to Jerominski. He said the organizations include IAM Healthcare, a union representing thousands of professionals in the health-care industry, and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents food, retail and health-care workers across the U.S. and Canada. IAM Healthcare did not immediately respond to a request for comment. UFCW directed CNBC to a statement released Thursday in support of the recent walkouts staged by Walgreens and CVS pharmacy staff. Retail pharmacy staff are concerned that companies like Walgreens and CVS are placing unreasonable demands on employees, without providing enough staffing or resources for them to safely and responsibly execute tasks such as filling prescriptions. The staff believes those working conditions ultimately put patients at risk of serious harm.  “What we’re doing in our stores is not safe for our customers,” the CVS employee told CNBC. “Improve our working conditions so we can improve the safety and the confidence of our customers that come into our stores.” In addition to filling and verifying prescriptions, pharmacy employees often have to juggle patient phone calls, administer a growing number of vaccines, work with insurance companies on issues such as copays and reimbursements, perform rapid Covid and flu testing and deal with frustrated customers who are seeing longer wait times due to understaffing. One Walgreens pharmacy technician in Minnesota, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, likened work shifts to running a marathon. They told CNBC that pharmacy staff always go home “completely overworked and exhausted” after a day of juggling dozens of different tasks. Walgreens pharmacy employees are asking the company to offer more transparency around how staff hours are assigned to stores, dedicate training time for each new hire and allocate job tasks in a way that matches the staffing levels of a given store location, according to the Walgreens organizer. Currently, the company sets task expectations based on the number of team members each pharmacy should have instead of how much staff the locations actually have, the organizer said.  Walgreens said it does not set task-based metrics for staff, noting that the company eliminated it last year. Pharmacy staff across different chains are also hoping that company management can address their concerns in a more timely fashion, Jerominski said.  “Pharmacists are kind of on an island where you don’t feel much support,” Jerominski said. “It feels like yelling into the void. You might call a supervisor or a district manager, but you might get a response a week later.”  A survey from last year shows that pharmacy workers who bring complaints to management sometimes get little response. The survey, conducted by the American Pharmacists Association and the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations, noted that there are “no open mechanisms” for pharmacists and other pharmacy staff to discuss workplace issues with supervisors and management. Some Walgreens pharmacy staff told CNBC that the rollout of new vaccines this fall, including shots for Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus, has made their workload heavier than usual.  One pharmacist, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said it is difficult to handle the recent influx of vaccine appointments, especially since those respiratory virus shots all arrived in the U.S. around the same time. The pharmacist described having appointments every 10 minutes, with some patients getting several shots at once. The pharmacist also described a recent work shift where they were the only immunizer on staff, which made it nearly impossible for them to fill prescriptions and complete other tasks.  Jerominski, the organizer and pharmacy labor advocate, claimed that immunizations have become a priority for Walgreens and CVS since the margins on vaccines are significantly higher than the average prescription. One Walgreens pharmacist from Colorado, who also requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, also highlighted how staff increasingly have to deal with frustrated customers.  That pharmacist said the lack of staffing and resources at some locations can lead to medication delays and errors or longer wait times for appointments, which sets employees up for negative interactions with patients. The Colorado pharmacist said patients are “rightfully upset” when they can’t pick up critical medications in a quick and seamless way. But it can get emotionally taxing for employees when patients target all of their anger and frustration on staff, the pharmacist said. Patients can get aggressive or even violent in rare cases, and it’s a “very long process” to get those customers banned from a store to protect employees, the Colorado pharmacist said.",CNBC
Hugh Son,"JPMorgan Chase tops profit expectations on higher rates, benign credit","In this article JPMorgan Chase on Friday topped analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue as the bank generated more interest income than expected, while credit costs were lower than anticipated. Here’s what the company reported: The bank said profit surged 35% to $13.15 billion, or $4.33 a share, from a year earlier. That per-share figure includes 17 cents in securities losses and 22 cents in legal expenses. It wasn’t  immediately clear which items were included in LSEG’s $3.96 a share profit estimate. Revenue climbed 21% to $40.69 billion, helped by the stronger-than-expected net interest income. That measure surged 30% to $22.9 billion, exceeding analysts’ expectations by roughly $600 million. At the same time, credit provisioning of $1.38 billion came in far lower than the $2.39 billion estimate. JPMorgan’s retail banking division saw profit surge 36% to $5.9 billion, fueled by higher net interest income and the acquisition of First Republic. Its corporate and investment bank saw profit slip 12% to $3.1 billion on declines in trading and advisory revenue. JPMorgan shares gained 1.5% on Friday following the report. CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged that the biggest U.S. bank by assets was “over-earning” on net interest income and “below normal” credit costs that will both normalize over time. While surging interest rates caught some smaller peers off guard this year, causing upheaval among regional lenders in March, JPMorgan has navigated the turmoil well so far. Dimon warned that while American consumers and businesses were healthy, households were spending down cash balances and that tight labor markets and “extremely high government debt levels” meant that interest rates may climb even further from here. “The war in Ukraine compounded by last week’s attacks on Israel may have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships,” Dimon said. “This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades. While we hope for the best, we prepare the firm for a broad range of outcomes.” The quarterly report comes after a period of uncertainty for U.S. banks. Bank stocks plunged last month after the Federal Reserve signaled it would keep interest rates higher for longer than expected to fight inflation amid unexpectedly robust economic growth. The 10-year Treasury yield, a key figure for long-term rates, jumped 74 basis points in the third quarter. One basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. Higher rates hit banks in several ways. The industry has been forced to pay up for deposits as customers shift holdings into higher-yielding instruments like money market funds. Rising yields mean the bonds owned by banks fall in value, creating unrealized losses that pressure capital levels. And higher borrowing costs tamp down demand for mortgages and corporate loans. While smaller competitors have seen net interest income damaged by higher rates this year, JPMorgan continued to benefit from the rate environment. The bank said Friday it now expects that net interest income will total $88.5 billion this year, up from guidance of $87 billion given in July. It was the fourth time the bank increased its guidance this year. During a conference call with analysts, Dimon and CFO Jeremy Barnum criticized U.S. regulators’ push to increase capital levels at banks with at least $100 billion in assets. Unless modified, the plan would boost JPMorgan’s required capital by 25%, or $50 billion, according to the bank. “A capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there’s a lot that does not make sense to us,” Barnum said, adding that regulators have repeatedly said U.S. banks were already well capitalized. Shares of JPMorgan have climbed 8.7% this year through Thursday, far outperforming the 19% decline of the KBW Bank Index. Wells Fargo and Citigroup posted results on Friday that topped expectations for revenue. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs report Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley discloses results on Wednesday.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Novo Nordisk hikes outlook on soaring demand for Wegovy, Ozempic","In this article Novo Nordisk on Friday raised its outlook for its full-year sales and operating profit due to soaring demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic.  The revised forecast only confirms the frenzy for those weekly injections, which patients seek for their ability to help them lose significant weight over time. Ozempic and Wegovy have propelled Novo Nordisk to become Europe’s most valuable company. The Danish drugmaker now expects 2023 sales growth in local currencies of 32% to 38%, from a previous outlook of 27% to 33%, according to a press release.  Novo Nordisk also expects operating profit growth of 40% to 46%, from 31% to 37% previously. The new sales outlook for this year primarily reflects higher expectations for Ozempic sales in the U.S. and “gross-to-net sales adjustments for Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S.,” according to the release. Novo Nordisk is slated to report third-quarter earnings Nov. 2. The company’s U.S.-listed shares rose about 1% and touched a new 52-week high Friday.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Taylor Swift concert film draws $2.8 million from last-minute previews,"In this article Taylor Swift fans had just eight hours to buy tickets for last-minute Thursday night previews of her The Eras Tour concert film. The result was $2.8 million in ticket sales. While the figure is low in comparison to blockbuster releases from Marvel, DC and Star Wars, it reflects the fact that film wasn’t originally slated for a Thursday release. In fact, fans weren’t told screenings were available early until late Wednesday night, and tickets for 6 p.m. showings weren’t available for purchase until 10 a.m. local time Thursday. Box office analysts don’t see the small Thursday night haul as any indication of the potential success of Swift’s film. “A storm is brewing,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “The 11th hour announcement of the availability of Thursday night pre-shows produced an early box office number that belies the true potential for the film. Pre-sales and incredible fan enthusiasm portend a blockbuster style weekend.” Expectations are that Swift could tally between $40 million and $60 million on Friday, on her way to an opening weekend draw of as much as $150 million. Any figure over $96 million for the weekend will make it the highest opening film in the month of October, beating out 2019′s “Joker.” “It’s a wild one to try and project,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “Everything comes down to how much walk-up business she can bring in outside her dedicated fans who already bought tickets weeks ago, on top of the average ticket price.” Swift’s film is on pace to open in about 3,850 theaters, making it the widest domestic release of a concert film. It is also set to have the highest opening weekend for a concert movie, surpassing Miley Cyrus’ “Best of Both Worlds Concert” from 2008, which snared $31.1 million during its domestic debut, according to data from Comscore. Should the film top $263 million globally during its limited run in theaters, which many box office analysts expect, it will also become the highest-grossing concert film worldwide, surpassing “Michael Jackson’s This Is It.” AMC Entertainment, which is distributing the film, reported last week that presales for its theaters had already exceeded $100 million for the full run of Swift’s film. Aiding Swift’s box office haul are average ticket prices that are more than 40% higher than typical releases this year. Base prices for tickets for standard formats start at $19.89 for adults and $13.13 for kids. The numbers reflect Swift’s birth year and her lucky number, 13. Tickets for premium format screens such as IMAX and Dolby come at a higher cost. Additionally, cinemas are also expected to get a big bump in concession sales. Specialty popcorn buckets, drinkware and boutique cocktails should grab the attention of moviegoers. Many locations also have plans to set up friendship bracelet-making tables and other in-person events to make the occasion bigger and more memorable than just a trip to the movies.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy launches $1 billion asteroid mission for NASA,"[The livestream has ended. A replay is available in the video player above.] SpaceX’s powerful Falcon Heavy rocket successfully launched on Friday morning, carrying a NASA mission bound for a distant asteroid. Targeting the asteroid Psyche, the eponymous NASA mission is flying a spacecraft — about the width of a tennis court — on a journey of almost six years and about 2.2 billion miles, arriving at the planetary body in July 2029. The launch took off at 10:19 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. NASA wants to study the composition of the asteroid, which the agency describes as “an unusual object likely rich in metal.” The Psyche spacecraft is armed with a variety of scientific tools, such as instruments for studying the asteroid’s magnetic field and chemical makeup. The agency expects to spend about $1.2 billion on the Psyche mission, including the costs of development and operations. Of that total cost, NASA awarded SpaceX a contract of about $131 million to launch the mission. The mission marks SpaceX’s eighth launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket, the company’s most powerful in operation. It landed the rocket’s pair of side boosters, to recover and reuse them for future launches.",CNBC
Angelica Peebles,"New RSV protections for infants hit cost, insurance hurdles in U.S. rollout","In this article Two new immunizations promise to protect babies from respiratory syncytial virus – if people can find them.  Providers are scrambling to offer Pfizer’s vaccine, Abrysvo, to pregnant patients and Sanofi’s monoclonal antibody, Beyfortus, to babies. The immunizations, both of which protect infants from complications of RSV, were recently approved and are starting to roll out just as the respiratory virus season gets underway.  The tight timeline leaves little room to resolve logistical hurdles like insurance coverage, and the steep price for the immunizations is making some providers wary of stocking up without a guarantee they’ll get paid for administering them. These hurdles threaten to prevent babies from receiving protection this winter and to hinder the launches of both drugs.  “We want to start protecting babies now,” said Michael Chamberlin, a doctor at Pediatric Associates of Mt. Carmel in Cincinnati, Ohio, adding the provider hasn’t received answers from insurers about whether they’re covering Beyfortus — and at what rate. “We need this information now, and when we contact insurance companies, we’re just not getting that information,” Chamberlin said. RSV typically feels like a cold for adults but can be dangerous for newborns, seniors and adults with chronic medical conditions. Complications from the virus are the leading cause of hospitalization among newborns.  Until now, the only preventative treatment was another monoclonal antibody called Synagis that’s given once a month during RSV season, which generally runs from fall through spring. It costs about $1,000 a dose and is recommended only for babies at high risk for severe illness.  The two new options work a little differently from one another but are both meant to protect more newborns from RSV. Pfizer’s Abrysvo is a vaccine given during pregnancy to stimulate an immune response that’s then passed onto the fetus. Sanofi’s Beyfortus is a monoclonal antibody that’s given directly to babies and provides them with immediate protection. Both cut the risk of severe disease or hospitalization by more than 50%. “Whether it’s a neighbor, or a friend, or an older sibling that was hospitalized, everybody knows what [RSV] is,” said Erin Bakke, whose 4-month-old son Graham received a Beyfortus shot this week. “I know that [RSV]’s a threat to little babies, and so to have an opportunity to prevent illness in the first place is really exciting.” Laura Riley, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian, originally wasn’t planning to administer Abrysvo in her office. The shot carries a list price of $295, making it more expensive than other maternal vaccines like one for whooping cough, for example, that costs about $50. “It’s not an inexpensive endeavor,” Riley said. But Riley said she heard from patients struggling to get vaccinated at pharmacies that were already administering the shot to seniors. And once she realized how difficult the process could be, she decided people clearly weren’t going to get vaccinated unless she made it easy for them and offered it right in the office.  Pfizer said any access issues are likely due to the quick turnaround from when Abrysvo was recommended for use during pregnancy. The vaccine was formally recommended for use during pregnancy earlier this month, the final step that some pharmacies and insurers wait for before administering or paying for new shots. Abrysvo was approved for use in people 60 and older in May. Health insurers have one year from when the CDC’s advisors recommend an immunization to start paying for it. Sanofi said more than 90% of infants are already covered by health plans, and Pfizer said it’s seeing early positive momentum. But insurers acknowledge that people may still face delays as they update their policies.  “Coverage during the one-year implementation period will vary from plan to plan as system, technical and coding issues may arise,” Kelly Parsons, a spokesperson for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said in a statement. Pediatricians of Dallas, where Graham Bakke received his Beyfortus shot, bought about 200 doses of the monoclonal antibody to see if insurers would accept the claims before ordering enough for the roughly 1,000 babies it ultimately expects to immunize against RSV this season, said James Watson, a doctor at the office. Insurers are reimbursing the office, Watson said, albeit at a lower rate than the shot costs. It’s a price the office is willing to pay.  “It’s the important thing to do,” Watson said. “If we lose a little money, we’ll see you for other things, and that’s just part of the game.”  — CNBC’s Patrick Manning contributed to this report.",CNBC
Jesse Pound,Citigroup reports better-than-expected revenue for the third quarter,"In this article Citigroup reported its third-quarter results on Friday morning, with solid growth in both institutional clients and personal banking fueling higher-than-expected revenue and earnings per share. Here’s what the company announced compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Revenue and net income rose by 9% and 2%, respectively, year over year. Citigroup’s institutional clients unit reported $10.6 billion in revenue, up 12% year over year and 2% from the second quarter. The bank said it was the best third quarter in the past decade for rates and currencies revenue. Meanwhile, the personal banking and wealth management division generated $6.8 billion in revenue, up roughly 10% year over year and 6% from the second quarter. “Despite the headwinds, our five core, interconnected businesses each posted revenue growth resulting in overall growth of 9%,” CEO Jane Fraser said in a press release. Despite the better-than-expected results, shares of the bank closed down 0.2% for the day. Citigroup’s stock is now down more than 8% for the year. Among other banks that reported quarterly results on Friday morning, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both showed stronger-than-expected revenue numbers in their third-quarter reports. Citigroup reported $1.84 billion in total cost of credit at the end of the quarter, up slightly from $1.82 billion at the end of the second quarter and $1.37 billion a year ago. That metric includes a net build of $125 million in the allowance for credit losses during the third quarter. Analysts were expecting total cost of credit to reach $1.96 billion, according to FactSet’s StreetAccount. “The global macro backdrop remains a story of desynchronization. In the US, recent data implies a soft-landing, but history would suggest otherwise and we are seeing some cracks in the lower [credit score] consumer. In the euro area and the UK, the picture turned distinctly more negative,” Fraser said on a call with analysts. Friday’s earnings report includes the period during which Fraser announced the bank would be divided into five main business lines, the latest change for the CEO since taking over in March 2021. Fraser said Friday that the changes should be completed by early 2024 and create financial benefits down the line. “While expense is not the primary driver of the organizational changes, they will help us start bending the expense curve in the fourth quarter of next year,” Fraser said. The new structure, announced Sept. 13, is expected to include job cuts. CFO Mark Mason declined to give guidance on head count during Friday’s call. Citigroup’s net interest margin for the quarter was 2.49%, above the 2.41% expected, according to FactSet’s StreetAccount. Mason said that the company expects its 2023 full-year net interest income to come in slightly above previous guidance. Another initiative under Fraser has been Citi selling off its retail banking business in some international markets. The latest move on that front came on Oct. 9, when the bank announced that it had struck a deal to sell its onshore consumer wealth portfolio in China. Fraser said Friday that the bank expects to close sale of Indonesia consumer business in the fourth quarter.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,"With booze, furniture and candles, Dungeons & Dragons makes itself at home","In this article It’s not every day that a spilled beer can start a company. But that’s exactly how Christoff Visscher got the idea for Cantrip Candles. An avid Dungeons & Dragons fan, Visscher was hosting a game when a beer got knocked over during a rowdy tavern interaction. The malty scent added to the ambiance of the scene and inspired him to start making his own candles and fragrances to elevate his friend’s tabletop gaming experience. Some seven years later, Visscher’s Cantrip Candles has a physical storefront in Hollywood and nearly two dozen custom scents — from the airy, pine-scented Walk in the Woods to the rich, smoky whiskey and firewood aroma of Black Hound Tavern. Inspired by fantasy games and settings like those seen in Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder and other popular tabletop role-playing games, Cantrip Candles has created its own lore to pair with its scents. They include Library Scriptorium (parchment, aged wood, leather), Den of Thieves (smoke, red wine, aged leather) and Forest of Fae (jasmine, neroli, tomato leaf and amber), all locations that could be found in any fantasy world. “We always make it our own,” said Visscher. “And that’s how we can be an authentic to ourselves. Sometimes, we create environments that aren’t the most traditional fantasy environments. We have a scent called Goldwheat Bakery.” It smells like yeast, bread and flour. Products from the company range from $15 for wax melts all the way up to $99 for 20-ounce centerpiece candles. Cantrip Candles also partners with other small businesses to sell wick trimmers, matches, notebooks, plush and apparel. Sellers need to be on their game with these customers, too. “They expect you to respect, understand and anticipate their needs, even though the problems you’re solving can be extremely niche,” said Ed Maranville, co-founder of Wyrmwood, a tabletop gaming accessory and furniture company. The customer base is growing, and it’s hungry for elevated, luxury merchandise that celebrates and enhances their fandom. It’s more than just T-shirts and special dice. There is a desire to live the fantasy, or at least incorporate it into day-to-day life. Crafters and hobbyists have turned into entrepreneurs creating unique and bespoke merchandise like wooden lamps shaped like 20-sided dice (commonly called d20s), custom wall art and just about any item you can find in a kitchen: cutting boards, glasses, spoons, you name it. It’s part of a wider trend among many different entertainment franchises, from Marvel and Star Wars to Harry Potter and “Friends,” as well as for fans of regency era romance novels, the horror genre and Broadway musicals. Dungeons & Dragons was created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in the early 1970s. It is a structured but open-ended role-playing game often played around a table. Players solve puzzles, go on quests and battle enemies. In recent years, due in large part to Covid social-distancing protocols, many games are played virtually using video-conferencing tools. Hasbro , which owns the Dungeons & Dragons brand through its subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, has boasted that the game has more than 50 million active players. These consumers have consistently boosted sales for Wizards, pushing the division’s revenue to over $1 billion in each of the last two years. Hasbro acquired Wizards of the Coast, the company that owned the rights to Dungeons & Dragons, in 1999. The Rhode Island-based toymaker is protective of its intellectual property. It recently tried to revamp its game license to crack down on third-party content creators and boost revenue. However, those plans were shot down in January, as the D&D community balked at the new terms, which were largely viewed as overreaching and unfair. The company did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment. The shopper cohort that stocks up on fantasy-themed lifestyle merch is often grouped as “kidults.” Essentially, this customer is 12 or older and spends money on collectibles, toys or merchandise. Last year, these kids-at-heart were responsible for one-quarter of all toy sales annually, around $9 billion worth, and were the biggest driver of growth throughout the industry, according to data from the NPD Group. Kidults buy other products linked to their interests, like furniture, art and even alcohol. And there are plenty of companies offering up unique, quality products for fantasy tabletop gamers. “In this community, in most fandoms, if you build something that’s premium, a luxury feeling item, people respond,” said Matthew Lillard, co-founder of Find Familiar Spirits. “The industry sort of discounts their buying power. They’re like, ‘Oh, they just want dice,’ but the reality is that I want something that speaks to me as a modern human. I want to be able to live it on my own.” Lillard, who rose to fame in the ’90s and early ’00s for roles in films like “Scream” and “Scooby-Doo,” is an avid Dungeons & Dragons player and fan of the fantasy role-playing genre. This week his new company, Find Familiar Spirits, which he founded alongside screenwriter Justin Ware, is launching its first in a series of limited edition whiskeys. Distilled in Indiana and Kentucky, the first whiskey edition, which has an initial run of 5,000 bottles, is called Paladin, named for the playable class in classic tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. It’s a bourbon whiskey blend with notes of vanilla, fruit and a little spice and will retail for $150. Three other whiskeys — Rogue, Warlock and Dragon — will roll out at later dates under the banner Quest’s End Whiskey. Early interest in the product has led the company to expand the number of bottles produced going forward. In total there will be 16 whiskeys, released every three to four months over the course of four years. Each bottle is paired with a booklet that contains a chapter of a new and original fantasy saga called “Dawn of the Unbound Gods.” With every release, a new chapter will be unveiled. Similarly to Cantrip Candles, Found Familiar Spirits is creating its own lore. “Our whole thing is that we’re creating an immersive unboxing experience that goes along with the whiskey,” Lillard said. “It does no good to create a beautiful bottle and a s--- whiskey.” Lillard is no stranger to selling products to this community. In 2018, he co-founded Beadle & Grimm’s, a gaming company that offers licensed expanded editions of Dungeons & Dragons modules, Magic: The Gathering sets and other games in the tabletop role-playing game space. The company started by selling premium $500 boxes filled with high-end miniatures, maps and props tied to specific Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. “Our belief is that if you create a high-end premium experience for a whiskey connoisseur, that also loves Dungeons & Dragons, people will turn out to buy and support that,” Lillard said. Other companies have found similar interest from consumers, particularly those looking to meld their fandom with their dining rooms. That’s where Wyrmwood Gaming comes in, offering products that serve multiple needs for consumers. In this case, a place to play weekly tabletop role-playing games and have dinner every night. “Gaming tables serve a need that most consumers have, which is to save space and give them flexibility in their life,” Wyrmwood’s Maranville said. “While some are fortunate enough to have a dedicated space for gaming, for most of us, space is at a premium, and your space for playing games is in either your living room, kitchen or dining area.” Wyrmwood is known for its high quality wooden accessories and gaming tables, which feature modular pieces that can transform furniture from a dining space to a fantasy landscape. The company first launched on independent online marketplace Etsy in 2012, offering products that could bring gamers “out of the basement.” The company now has its own website. “As lifelong gamers, there weren’t a lot of options for finely made accessories,” Maranville said. “Gaming could often still feel like a childish hobby, despite the enormous passion and seriousness that many gamers bring to it, along with their grown-up tastes and budgets.” Prices range from $600 to more than $10,000 based on table size, shape, wood and other customizations. The company also sells accessories with magnetic components including cup holders, card and poker chip holders, dice trays and bottle openers. Wyrmwood recently extended its line to include a customizable modular desk. Maranville said he knew the company would thrive nearly a decade ago when Wyrmwood first attended the PAX East convention in 2014. He said patrons gravitated toward the brand because it took their passion seriously and provided merchandise for everyday use. “We sold out of everything, I completely lost my voice, and our little booth was inundated with attendees all weekend long,” he said.",CNBC
Mike Calia,‘The Exorcist: Believer’ and Hispanic audiences: A match made in horror movie heaven,"In this article Take it on faith. The new “Exorcist” movie will draw big Hispanic audiences. Universal is seeing stronger-than-average Hispanic interest for “The Exorcist: Believer” as the movie heads into its opening weekend, according to people familiar with the matter. This fits a pattern among recent religious-horror releases such as “The Nun II” and “The Pope’s Exorcist.” Lea este artículo en español aquí. “They like the emotions. They like the scary aspect of it. It’s something that’s unique in our culture,” Rolando Rodriguez, the Cuban-born chairman of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said of Hispanic and Latino crowds. “We expect big things out of ‘The Exorcist.’” “The Exorcist: Believer,” a sequel to the classic 1973 original, tells the story of two girls who disappear for three days in present-day Georgia and end up possessed by a demon, or demons, traumatizing their families and resuming an old battle that is rooted in the first movie. It stars Leslie Odom Jr. of “Hamilton” fame. The new film is slated to open in more than 3,600 theaters Friday, including Imax and other premium formats. It’s expected to pull in up to $30 million in its first weekend. While that should be enough to send it to No. 1 at the domestic box office for the weekend, it remains to be seen whether the film and the next two entries in a planned trilogy will pay off for NBCUniversal. The company’s movie studio and streaming service, Peacock, shelled out $400 million for the movies. “The Exorcist: Believer” also faces a formidable foe in its second weekend: Taylor Swift, who’s releasing the concert film version of her megahit Eras Tour. “Believer” is also entering a crowded horror movie marketplace. Hollywood and indie studios are releasing scary flicks just about every week as Halloween approaches. “The horror genre is as popular and plentiful as ever, with a consistent demand from audiences driving studios to keep the pipeline flowing with scary movies big and small, with both major and independent studios supplying the seemingly insatiable demand from an adoring fanbase of thrill-seeking moviegoers,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. Hispanic and Latino viewers will have a big say in how “The Exorcist: Believer” does at the box office, no matter what. They tend to represent 26% of horror movie audiences, compared with 20% for other genres, according to the Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak Audience Survey. “Horror films are a communal experience for Latinos, especially in big cities with multiple cinemas located within blocks of one another,” said R.C. Jara, a film writer who has been published on sites such as Hear Us Scream and Dread Central. Hispanic audiences’ taste for horror goes back a long way in Hollywood. In 1931, Universal released a Spanish-language version of the Bela Lugosi film “Dracula,” made with a different cast and crew, that has become a cult classic in its own right. The Oscar-winning career of Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (“Pan’s Labyrinth”) is full of macabre and fantastical tales. Hispanic viewers made up a whopping 44% of the audience during the opening weekend for the new “Saw X.” Beyond the movies, creepy folk tales about bogeyman El Cucuy and weeping ghost La Llorona go back even further. “We are a unique blend of ‘the old ways’ and modern Christianity, with a large portion of our members practicing Catholicism specifically,” Angel Melanson, an editor at horror publication Fangoria, told CNBC in an email. “These horror stories aren’t saved for once we come of age and ‘can handle’ them. Instead, they’re freely shared right from the start.” Religion is at the core of much of the fervor for spooky stuff among the rapidly growing Hispanic population in the United States. As of last year, Catholics accounted for the biggest religious bloc among Latinos, according to Pew Research Center. The original film “The Exorcist” and its source novel — both written by the late William Peter Blatty, a devout Catholic — are set within the dogma and rituals of Roman Catholicism. They tell the story of a preteen girl (played by Linda Blair in the movie) whose possession by a demon leaves her mother (Ellen Burstyn, who returns in the new film) with no choice but to petition priests (Jason Miller and Max von Sydow) to perform an exorcism. Some of the story’s most shocking moments come when the demon says blasphemous things and performs profane acts, particularly during a notorious scene involving a crucifix. “Religious horror is flirting with danger. Something maybe your abuela would yell at you for watching, but doesn’t that make it all the more appealing? Forbidden fruit. A horror story based on things we grow up learning are true and possible,” Melanson said. Religious horror films resonate deeply with Latino moviegoers in large part because of the emphasis on rituals, experts say. “Even for modern Latinos who don’t practice Brujeria or cleansings, Catholicism is rife with ritual. So there’s this concept of being able to defeat the demon with ritual, a how-to-survive guidebook of sorts,” Melanson said. But it’s not unusual to hear atheistic or agnostic horror fans say “The Exorcist” made them believe, if only for two hours. The original movie, released the day after Christmas in 1973, was the kind of must-see event that resulted in lines of moviegoers of all faiths wrapping around blocks to wait for a screening. Hollywood hadn’t released anything like it before, not even Alfred Hitchcock’s classic slasher “Psycho” or the similarly satanic “Rosemary’s Baby,” in terms of shock value. “The Exorcist” grossed more than $193 million, according to Comscore data. That would still be a big haul for a movie released these days, especially one as explicitly graphic as “The Exorcist.” At its heart, though, the movie is a tense, confrontational theological drama. “I believe very strongly in God and the power of the human soul,” the late William Friedkin, who directed “The Exorcist,” once said in an interview. “I also believe that they are unknowable. But the film, ‘The Exorcist,’ is primarily about the mystery of faith, the mystery of goodness, that mystery which is inexplicable, but it’s there.” The new movie’s director, David Gordon Green, is looking to tap into similar ground. “Whatever faith you subscribe to, there’s always that curiosity, always that interest in the unknown,” Green, who also co-wrote “The Exorcist: Believer” and is set to helm its sequels, told CNBC. Indeed, Green, who grew up Presbyterian and helps steer HBO’s evangelical comedy “The Righteous Gemstones,” took a small-c catholic approach to the story of the new “Exorcist.” The film opens up the religious sandbox beyond Jesuit priests, also embracing voodoo and evangelical rituals. Catholics don’t have a monopoly on the subject, after all. Possession, Green said, comprises a “huge world” of myths and ideas, from various cultures. “We may have doubt, we may have certainty, but until we experience something, we don’t really know. There’s something beautiful about that,” he said. The franchise’s branching out from its Catholic roots mirrors what’s happening among Latinos in the U.S. According to Pew, while Catholicism remains the largest faith among the group, the share of the population who identify as Catholic has fallen dramatically in recent years. Meanwhile, the number of Latinos who aren’t affiliated with any religion is surging. In fact, those ages 18 to 29 are more likely to be unaffiliated than Catholic, according to the study. “Speaking on behalf of my profoundly Catholic family members, films about serial killers, monsters and especially demonic possession are a means of facing evil vicariously through fiction,” said Jara, reflecting on the genre. “But those of us, like myself, who are agnostic towards the existence of a higher power have found a primary home in horror.” Still, even as beliefs shift, it’s not “The Exorcist” without religion. The next entry in the planned trilogy is scheduled for release on April 18, 2025 — Good Friday. Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC and Universal Pictures, the distributor of “The Exorcist: Believer.”",CNBC
Amelia Lucas,"Popeyes overtakes KFC as No. 2 chicken chain, but Chick-fil-A stays on top","In this article Popeyes has overtaken KFC as the No. 2 chicken chain in the U.S., a decade after Chick-fil-A first unseated KFC from the top spot. Chicken chains’ battle for stomachs — and dollars — has become more aggressive in recent years. Chick-fil-A moved from a regional player to a nationwide chain that trails only McDonald’s and Starbucks in annual sales. Restaurant Brands International ’s Popeyes launched a chicken sandwich in 2019 that turned into a blockbuster menu item and ushered in the chicken sandwich wars. Burger chains such as McDonald’s and Wendy’s jumped onto the trend and added their own offerings, leading to poultry shortages. In the fray, Yum Brands ’ KFC has lost ground. In the past year, its U.S. market share fell to 11.3% from 16.1%, according to Barclays research. Similar to KFC, Popeyes lost market share in the past year, but still retained enough to leapfrog its rival. The chain saw its U.S. market share shrink to 11.9% from 15%, according to Barclays. Blame Chick-fil-A, which saw its market share expand to 45.5% from 38.3%. The privately held Atlanta-based chain is more dominant than ever. Chick-fil-A is still closed on Sundays, but industry experts credit its customer service, short menu and efficient drive-thru lanes for its success. KFC’s domestic business has struggled to keep up with the competition. It took more than a year for KFC to respond to Popeyes’ chicken sandwich. The chain also lost longtime U.S. leader Kevin Hochman last year to Brinker International, where he now serves as CEO. KFC did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment. Popeyes, on the other hand, has used the popularity of its chicken sandwich to introduce customers to other menu items and to fuel new restaurant openings. More recently, the chain’s Sweet ’N Spicy Wings became its most popular launch since the chicken sandwich. “Game on, Chick-fil-A,” Restaurant Brands International Chair Patrick Doyle said in mid-September at Scotiabank’s Back to School Conference, responding to a question about the chain’s new spot as the No. 2 chicken chain. Popeyes President Sami Siddiqui said in a statement to CNBC that the chain is still in the early innings as it tries to become the most loved and visited U.S. chicken chain. “We view this special milestone as an indicator that we’re headed in the right direction with much more growth to come,” he said.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,Clorox says sales and profit took a big hit from cyberattack,"In this article Clorox on Wednesday warned that its sales and profit took a big hit during the quarter ending Sept. 30, largely due to the after effects of a cyberattack that significantly affected operations. The bleach and cleaning products maker said it expects net sales to decrease 23% to 28%. Clorox also estimates its gross margin for the quarter will be down from the year-ago period. It expects to post a per share loss of 35 cents to 75 cents. On an adjusted basis, it projects a loss of up to 40 cents a share. Clorox also said the cyberattack, which it disclosed in August, continues to hurt production, although the effect is lessening. “The Company also expects to begin to benefit from the restocking of retailer inventories as it ramps up fulfillment” during the current quarter, it said in a release. Clorox said it is still assessing what effect the hack could have on the current fiscal year and beyond. The effects of the attack were widescale, the company disclosed in a September securities filing. While operational systems were repaired, Clorox resorted to going manual on many of its procedures, slowing down product fulfillment. Nonetheless, the company has said the threat is contained. Scattered Spider, a group of hackers tied to recent cyberattacks on casino companies MGM and Caesars, is suspected of being tied to the August attack on Clorox, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. MGM also warned in September that the attack could have a material effect on company finances.",CNBC
Stefan Sykes,"Tilray Brands’ revenue jumps, losses narrow as it pivots away from cannabis","In this article Cannabis producer Tilray Brands  on Wednesday reported a jump in revenue as it diversifies its portfolio and moves deeper into the beer industry. The company reported $177 million in net revenue, up 15% year over year, for its fiscal first quarter. Its cannabis division brought in $70 million in net revenue, reflecting a 20% spike year over year. It also narrowed its net loss to $55.9 million during the quarter, compared to a loss of $65.8 million a year earlier. Tilray is a multinational cannabis company based in Canada, but it has increasingly moved into other segments, particularly the U.S. craft beer industry, as it navigates an uncertain legal environment for marijuana around the world. The company said it grew cannabis revenue in Canada by 16.5% and strengthened its leading market share position in the country to 13.4%. Canada is one of the few major markets where recreational cannabis is legal at the federal level. On an earnings call Wednesday, CEO Irwin Simon said the company’s recent beverage mergers and acquisitions will accelerate growth and expand the company’s footprint beyond its recreational cannabis business as the drug remains illegal in key markets in the world, including at the federal level in the U.S. and in much of Europe. “We’re waiting for legalization to happen in the U.S.,” Simon said separately during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Wednesday. “If it happens, it will be great and we’re well-positioned.” If legalization in the U.S. doesn’t happen, Simon said the company will fall back on its booming beverage business. In recent years, the company has been on a buying spree, making deals in what it said are fast-growing markets, such as craft beers and cannabis-infused beverages. Earlier this week, Tilray completed its acquisition of eight beer brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev that it had announced over the summer. The company said the deal makes it the fifth largest in the U.S. craft beer market. Around the same time, the company acquired the remaining 57.5% equity ownership of cannabis-infused drinks maker Truss Beverage from Molson Coors Canada. The transaction prices of both deals were not disclosed. Tilray’s beverage alcohol revenue jumped 17% to $24 million in its first quarter, from $21 million in the prior-year period. It cited in part growth in its Montauk Brewing Company subsidiary. Tilray acquired Montauk, a fast-growing brewer in metro New York, in 2022. “We have strategically diversified our company globally over the past several years and, as a result, Tilray is now ideally positioned to capture a wide range of opportunities across multiple industries,” said Simon in the earnings release.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Disney discounting child tickets at U.S. parks as industry attendance lags,"In this article It’s about to be cheaper for families to visit Disney’s domestic theme parks. The Walt Disney Company on Wednesday announced new, limited time discounts on children’s tickets at Disneyland and Disney World. Starting Oct. 24, parents can purchase children’s ticket (valid for kids aged three to nine) for the California-based Disneyland resort for as low as $50 each. Tickets can be used between Jan. 8 and March 10 of next year. As for the Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, children’s tickets and dining plans will be half-off for guests who purchase a four-day, four-night vacation package at one of its resorts. The deal starts Nov. 14 and can be used from March 3 through June 30, 2024. The price cuts come as the company’s U.S.-based parks have seen a slowdown in attendance and hotel room occupancy as consumers face higher costs due to inflation. Disney is not the only company facing these issues. Universal’s domestic parks, as well as region players like Six Flags and Sea World , have reported lower attendance this year. Travel agents have pointed to higher ticket prices and a rise in trips to Europe as the major factors in declining domestic theme park attendance. This is not the first time Disney has offered limited time deals or altered pricing. Earlier this year, the company updated policies at both domestic parks, including modifications to its reservation and ticketing systems for annual pass memberships. The changes came as guests complained about rising prices and longer wait times. Parks, experiences and products, the division that runs Disney’s parks, has remained a bright spot for the company in recent quarters. Disney has faced ad-related revenue losses within its traditional media business and has had difficulty monetizing its streaming business, as production costs and licensing fees soar. Meanwhile, the parks division saw a 13% increase in revenue during the third quarter, reaching $8.3 billion. The company has touted that this segment has expanded at a combined annual growth rate of 6% since 2017, and generated $32.3 billion in operating income over the last 12 months. Disney is leaning further into the successful business. The company is expected to nearly double its investment in its parks division, with plans to spend around $60 billion over the next 10 years. Projects already in motion include redesigning Splash Mountain at both domestic resorts with a “Princess and the Frog” theme, as well as updates to existing hotel and resort locations. Disney also plans to nearly double the capacity of its cruise line, adding two ships in fiscal 2025 and another in 2026. The company provided “blue sky” ideas for its parks during its D23 Expo last year in Anaheim, California. These projects are still in early development and may not see the light of day. This included the possibility of revamping Dino Land at Animal Kingdom in Orlando to be themed as a “Zootopia” or “Moana” area. At Magic Kingdom, Disney is asking the question: “What is behind Big Thunder Mountain?” The company teased that an area based on “Coco” or “Encanto,” or both, could be in that location. There were also talks about the possibility of bringing to life an area of the Magic Kingdom overrun by Disney villains. Price points will vary for these projects, if they do come to fruition. The recent additions of the two Star Wars: Galaxy Edge lands in Disneyland and Disney World are estimated to have cost $1 billion each.

Michael Wayland,GM secures new $6 billion credit line as UAW strike costs reach $200 million,"In this article DETROIT – General Motors secured a new $6 billion line of credit as the automaker braces for additional strikes by the United Auto Workers union. “The facility that we announced today is a $6 billion line of credit that I think is prudent in light of some of the messages that we’ve seen from some of the UAW leadership that they intend to drag this on for months,” CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC’s Phil LeBeau in an interview on “Halftime Report.” The targeted strikes already cost the automaker $200 million during the third quarter, GM said Wednesday. A GM spokesman said the $200 million strike cost is due to lost production on wholesale volume, largely due to the UAW’s initial Sept. 15 strike at GM’s midsize truck and full-size van plant in Wentzville, Missouri. The strike has since expanded to GM’s parts and distribution facilities nationwide and, as of last Friday, a crossover plant in mid-Michigan. As a result of the strike in Missouri, GM also idled its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas, where it builds the Cadillac XT4 SUV and the Chevrolet Malibu sedan, and laid off nearly 2,000 workers. Both GM CEO Mary Barra as well as Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley have publicly criticized UAW President Shawn Fain and the union’s strike strategy, claiming Fain is not actually interested in reaching deals for 146,000 workers with GM, Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis . “It’s clear that there is no real intent to get to an agreement,” Barra said in an emailed statement Friday night. “It is clear Shawn Fain wants to make history for himself, but it can’t be to the detriment of our represented team members and the industry.” Fain has consistently said the union is available to negotiate 24/7 and has in turn accused the automakers of slow-walking negotiations. GM’s newly announced line of credit will require the automaker to maintain at least $4 billion in global liquidity and $2 billion in U.S. liquidity. The terms of the credit agreement also restrict GM from mergers or sales of assets and limits on other, new debt. As of June 30, GM’s total automotive liquidity was $38.9 billion. The credit line comes more than a month after Ford obtained a $4 billion line of credit to help it manage through “uncertainties” in the market.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,Ford pickup truck sales lead third-quarter growth,"In this article DETROIT – Ford Motor’s third-quarter U.S. new vehicle sales increased 7.7% compared with a year earlier, led by higher sales of traditional pickup trucks across its lineup. The Detroit automaker on Wednesday reported a 15.3% increase in truck sales compared with a 5.1% decline in cars and sales of SUVs that were essentially flat. Ford’s sales jump was in line with Edmunds’ expectations for the automaker but below auto analyst forecasts for the overall industry of an increase of 15% to 16% for the third quarter. The automaker’s sales of electric vehicles were up by 14.8% during the quarter to nearly 21,000 units. A vast majority of those sales were the Mustang Mach-E crossover, as sales of the F-150 lightning electric pickup were off about 46% during the quarter due to slower-than-expected demand and downtime at the plant. Ford’s EV sales represented only about 3% of the roughly 1.5 million vehicles sold by the automaker through the first nine months of the year, including 4.2% of sales during the third quarter. Ford hybrid sales, led by the F-150 and Maverick hybrid trucks, posted third-quarter sales of 34,861 vehicles – up 41.4% over a year earlier. An ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers union against the Detroit automakers, including Ford, was not expected to directly impact sales much during the quarter. Next month could be more challenging due to the strikes, however, especially for vehicles such as the Ford Bronco SUV and Ranger midsize pickup – the first vehicles for the automaker to stop production due to the strikes, which began Sept. 15. Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with GM, Ford Motor and Stellantis, are part of the work stoppages. The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began, after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts in which all plants simultaneously strike. National strikes affect the companies more quickly. The targeted walkouts aim to preserve the union’s funds and prolong the work stoppages to keep the automakers off keel.",CNBC
Diana Olick,"Mortgage demand drops to the lowest level since 1996, as rates head toward 8%","Mortgage rates just continue to climb higher, taking a particularly big leap last week. As a result, total mortgage demand fell 6% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.53% from 7.41%, with points rising to 0.80 from 0.71 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 6.75% the same week one year ago. “Mortgage rates continued to move higher last week as markets digested the recent upswing in Treasury yields,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist. “As a result, mortgage applications ground to a halt, dropping to the lowest level since 1996.” Applications to refinance a home loan dropped 7% for the week and were 11% lower than the same week one year ago. Refinances now make up less than one-third of all mortgage applications. Just two years ago, when rates were setting multiple record lows, refinance demand made up roughly three-quarters of all mortgage applications. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 6% for the week and were 22% lower than the same week one year ago. “The purchase market slowed to the lowest level of activity since 1995, as the rapid rise in rates pushed an increasing number of potential homebuyers out of the market,” said Kan, who also noted that adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) applications increased. The ARMs made up 8% of purchase applications, up from 6.7% about a month ago, when interest rates were slightly lower. ARM’s offer lower rates but are fixed for a shorter term, usually five or 10 years. A separate, daily survey on mortgage rates from Mortgage News Daily showed the average rate on the 30-year fixed rising even higher this week, hitting 7.72% on Tuesday. Investors are responding to better-than-expected economic data, which could push the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in its higher interest rate policy.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Moderna combination Covid, flu vaccine enters final trial after positive data","In this article Moderna on Wednesday said its combination vaccine targeting Covid and the flu will move to a final stage trial in adults ages 50 and above this year after showing positive results in an early to mid-stage study. The biotech company hopes its shot, mRNA-1083, can win approval from regulators in 2025.  Moderna and other vaccine makers like Pfizer believe combination vaccines will simplify what people can do to protect themselves against respiratory viruses that typically surge around the same time of the year. “Combination vaccines offer an important opportunity to improve consumer and provider experience, increase compliance with public health recommendations, and deliver value for healthcare systems,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement.  “We are excited to move combination respiratory vaccines into Phase 3 development and look forward to partnering with public health officials to address the significant seasonal threat posed to people by these viruses,” he added. The mRNA-1083 shot generated an immune response similar to or greater than two currently available flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline in the early to mid-stage clinical trial.  Moderna’s combination shot also produced an immune response similar to its bivalent Covid vaccine, which targets the omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 and the original strain of the virus.  The trial evaluated the combination shot in two different age groups: people 50 to 64 years of age and participants 65 to 79.  The safety data of mRNA-1083 was similar to that of the stand-alone Covid shot, according to Moderna. No new safety concerns were identified with the combination vaccine.  Moderna is also developing a combination shot targeting the flu and RSV, and another vaccine targeting all three respiratory viruses: Covid, flu and RSV.  Meanwhile, Pfizer and BioNTech also are developing a vaccine that targets both Covid and the flu. The companies started a phase one trial for the shot in November and said they expect to launch it in 2024 or later.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,GM’s third-quarter sales jump 21% as UAW strike slowly expands,"DETROIT – An ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers union against the Detroit automakers had little to no direct effect on General Motors’ third-quarter U.S. new vehicle sales. The Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported a 21.4% increase in sales from July through September, compared to still subdued sales in the third quarter of 2022, when the industry was still recovering from supply chain issues. GM’s increase significantly outpaced auto analyst expectations for the overall industry of 15% to 16% for the third quarter. Sales of every one of the Detroit automaker’s brands rose compared to a year earlier. Not all automakers faired as well as GM in the quarter. But their sales largely climbed in terms of vehicles sold compared to a year ago. Third-quarter sales results reported Tuesday included: Toyota Motor up 12.2%; Hyundai Motor up roughly 9%; Kia up about 14%; Mazda up about 22%; and Honda up roughly 53%. Stellantis was an outlier, as sales slid 1.3%. The company’s decline is notable, but not likely to be attributed to the UAW strikes. Stellantis’ sales have struggled as it attempts to retain high profits achieved in recent years by not discounting its vehicles as much as it has historically. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Though work stoppages may not have hit their results yet, GM and other companies likely will face sales and supply chain problems if the UAW’s strike, which began Sept. 15, is expanded or prolonged. Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with GM, Ford Motor and Stellantis, are part of the work stoppages. UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began, after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts in which all plants simultaneously strike. National strikes affect the companies more quickly. The targeted walkouts aim to preserve the union’s funds and prolong the work stoppages to keep the automakers off keel. The impacts of the strikes will likely begin showing in October for certain vehicles such as the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickups, where work stoppages have affected production, according to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke. “Thus far, the impact has been fairly muted,” Smoke said in a Friday blog post. “Should the strike against production sites further expand, the more vulnerable products are the large SUVs from Chevrolet and Cadillac, which have tighter inventory levels compared to their domestic rivals.” For GM, the UAW strikes have hit production of the midsize pickups and Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs. GM’s sales heading into the fourth quarter were up more than 19% to roughly 1.97 million vehicles sold in the U.S. That included more than 20,000 electric vehicle sales, a 28% increase compared to the second quarter. Notably, the automaker started selling new electric versions of its Chevrolet Blazer SUV and Silverado pickup during the third quarter. The company also increased production and sales of the Cadillac Lyriq EV and Hummer models during the quarter. However, sales still pale in comparison to Tesla’s electric vehicle deliveries. During the quarter, GM also was assisted by growth of newer, entry-level models such as the Chevrolet Trax and Buick Envista, both of which are being imported from plants in South Korea.",CNBC
Leslie Josephs,"United Airlines buys 110 additional Boeing, Airbus jets with delivery slots scarce","In this article United Airlines is ordering 110 additional Boeing and Airbus jetliners, locking in a supply of new planes into the next decade as strong demand and supply chain challenges make new delivery slots scarce. “We would not normally order jets this far out,” United’s chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, told reporters Tuesday. “Production lines, which are now regularly plagued by supply-chain disruptions and delivery delays, are also increasingly sold out for the entire decade.” Deliveries of the new planes are scheduled to start in 2028. United’s order consists of 50 more Boeing 787 Dreamliners, adding to a firm order of 100 of the twin-aisle planes it announced last December, along with 50 more options. The airline has aggressively expanded its international service to try to capitalize on a resurgence of trips abroad, destinations that the new long-range 787 planes would serve. The Chicago-based airline is also buying 60 Airbus A321neos, on top of the 120 it previously had on order with the European manufacturer, including 50 of forthcoming extra-long-range version. United added options for 40 more Airbus A321s. United and other airlines have recently ordered new planes have said one way around infrastructure constraints is to operate larger aircraft with more seats on them, a practice known as upgauging. The airline said it expects an average of more than 145 seats per North American departure in 2027, up 40% from 2019. The carrier’s upsized order comes as airlines are battling for new, more fuel-efficient aircraft to cater to the post-Covid travel boom. Delivery delays have left airlines with a shortfall of planes, while upgrades that target an increasing number of travelers willing to splurge on premium seats have also run behind schedule. United on Tuesday announced a revamp of its bedding and amenities kits for its Polaris business class, which include eye serums and a face spray.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"FDA, CDC back Novavax updated Covid vaccine","In this article Novavax ’s updated Covid vaccine won the backing of the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday, putting the shot on track to roll out weeks after new jabs from Pfizer and Moderna reached Americans. The FDA authorized Novavax’s single-strain vaccine, which targets omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, for emergency use in people ages 12 and up. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is including Novavax’s shot in the same recommendation it issued last month for updated vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. That recommendation says all Americans ages six months and older can receive an updated Covid jab. Novavax said in a statement that doses of the shot will likely be available within the next few days. “Novavax’s authorization today means people will now have the choice of a protein-based non-MRNA option to help protect themselves against Covid-19, which is now the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.,” said Novavax CEO John Jacobs in the statement. “In the coming days, individuals in the U.S. can go to major pharmacies, physicians’ offices, clinics and various government entities to receive an updated Novavax vaccine.”  Public health officials see Novavax’s vaccine as a valuable alternative for people who don’t want to take messenger RNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna, which teach cells how to make proteins that trigger an immune response against Covid. Novavax’s shot fends off the virus with protein-based technology, a decades-old method used in routine vaccinations against hepatitis B and shingles. Around 2 million Americans have received the updated Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna so far, the Biden administration said last week, even as patients eager to get their dose have been met with unexpected insurance delays and availability issues. Regardless, all three shots are expected to help the U.S. combat the spread of Covid this fall and winter, when the virus usually spreads at higher levels.  The nation is already seeing a surge in cases and hospitalizations. While levels remain far below previous Covid waves in the U.S., it’s still the first notable uptick since last winter and has even prompted the return of mask mandates for a handful of businesses and schools.  The rise is driven by newer strains of the virus that are gaining ground nationwide as XBB.1.5 gradually declines. That includes EG.5, or Eris, an omicron strain that accounted for 29.4% of all cases as of Saturday, according to the CDC.  A Novavax spokesperson said last month its new Covid vaccine generated a “broad immune response” against Eris and another fast-spreading strain called XBB.1.16.6 – both of which are descendants of omicron.   But it’s unclear whether the company’s new vaccine will protect against BA.2.86, a highly mutated omicron strain that health officials are watching closely despite its small number of cases. Novavax last month said it was still testing its vaccine against BA.2.86. The rollout of Novavax’s new shot comes months after the end of the U.S. Covid public health emergency.  The end of that declaration means all three manufacturers will sell their updated shots directly to health-care providers and vie for commercial market share.  Previously, the government purchased vaccines directly from manufacturers at a discount to distribute to all Americans for free.  During the advisory meeting last month, Novavax said the list price of its vaccine is $130 per dose. Federal and corporate programs are aiming to fill the gap for uninsured Americans. That includes the Biden administration’s Bridge Access Program, which will provide Covid vaccines at no cost to underinsured and uninsured people.  It’s unclear how many Americans will actually roll up their sleeves and take the new vaccines from Novavax, Pfizer and Moderna. But roughly 42% of Americans surveyed by the CDC in August said they “definitely will” or “probably will” get a Covid shot this fall, Dr. Megan Wallace, a CDC epidemiologist, said during the advisory meeting.",CNBC
Diana Olick,Popular 30-year mortgage rate races toward 8%,"The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 7.72% on Tuesday, according to Mortgage News Daily. Mortgage rates follow loosely the yield on the 10-year Treasury , which has been climbing this week following strong economic data. Rates have not been this high since the end of 2000. At the beginning of this year, the 30-year fixed rate dropped to about 6%, causing a brief burst of activity in the spring housing market. But it began rising steadily again over the summer, causing sales to drop, despite strong demand. The current trend appears to be even higher, with the possibility of rates crossing over 8%. The Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates two weeks ago but indicated the possibility of another hike this year and fewer cuts than expected next year. Investors were waiting to see the results of economic data in the first week of October. “It is now the first week of October, and data has been stronger,” wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. “This morning’s JOLTS (job openings and labor turnover survey) is the biggest, baddest confirmation so far this week, and it’s pushing yields to fresh long-term highs. Pretty simple stuff, actually, even if unpleasant and unfortunate for fans of low rates.” Higher rates have crushed affordability, hitting both the new and existing home sales markets. While builders had been benefiting from the tight supply of existing homes for sale, higher mortgage rates are a major concern now. Builder sentiment slipped into negative territory in September for the first time in five months. To put rates in perspective, for a borrower purchasing a $400,000 home with a 20% down payment on a 30-year fixed loan, the monthly payment today is about $930 more than it was when rates were at 3% during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.",CNBC
Amelia Lucas,Chipotle tests automation for burrito bowls and salads,"In this article Chipotle Mexican Grill is testing whether automation can make customers’ burrito bowls and salads. It’s the second time the burrito chain has publicly announced testing automation at its innovation center. Chippy, Chipotle’s first foray into automation, is a robot that makes tortilla chips. The company began testing Chippy at a California restaurant a year ago after it passed the first round of testing. Restaurants ranging from Sweetgreen to Starbucks have been investing in automation to cut down on labor costs and improve order consistency and speed. But robotics and artificial intelligence software can be expensive, so it will likely be years before the technology pays off for restaurants. Still, many operators have big hopes for automation’s future in the restaurant industry. Sweetgreen opened its first automated location in May and CEO Jonathan Neman already expects all of the chain’s future restaurants to be automated in five years. The Chipotle test announced Tuesday is part of a collaboration with Hyphen, a startup that’s trying to automate restaurant kitchens. Last year, Chipotle invested an undisclosed amount in Hyphen, formerly known as Ono Food. The startup has a valuation of $104 million, according to PitchBook. All Chipotle restaurants have two make lines to assemble orders: one in the front for diners who order in person and another in the kitchen for digital orders. Roughly two-thirds of all Chipotle digital orders are either burrito bowls or salads, according to Chipotle. The Hyphen robot will make burrito bowls and salads for digital orders only. The technology moves the bowls underneath the digital make line to dispense the correct ingredients. Simultaneously, an employee can assemble digital orders for other items, such as tacos, quesadillas and burritos, on the digital make line. When the robot is done making an order, it sends the bowl or salad back up to the surface so employees can properly package the order.",CNBC
Robert Frank,"There’s a shortage of luxury apartments in Manhattan, and it’s driving up prices","A shortage of luxury apartments in Manhattan is causing a surge in prices at the top of the market, even as broader apartment sales and prices come under pressure from rising mortgage rates. Manhattan apartment sales fell 23% in the third quarter as rising interest rates squeezed potential buyers, according to new data from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. Median and average sales prices remained flat, with the average price of a Manhattan apartment stalled at $1.96 million and the median price at $1.15 million. The high end of the market, however, has seen a big drop in supply and stronger prices. The supply of luxury apartments — defined as the top 10% of the market by price — has plunged 24% compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to Miller Samuel. The inventory of luxury apartments for sale marked their lowest third quarter in five years. Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, said high-end buyers are typically less sensitive to mortgage rates since they often pay in cash. As a result, the wealthy have continued buying and taking advantage of more attractive prices. At the same time, newly built condominium towers have been the main driver of high-end sales since the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, most of those new, high-priced condominiums have been sold — and few new projects are being launched due to a lack of bank lending. “A lot of that new development inventory sold off during the pandemic boom,” Miller said. “The higher end of the market is seeing much less of a contribution from new development sales.” With fewer new luxury condominium towers now under construction, prices at the high end could continue to rise or remain strong, brokers say. According to Serhant, there were nine sales of Manhattan apartments priced at $20 million or more in the third quarter, compared to just two during the same period last year. Median prices for luxury apartments have increased in three of the past four quarters, according to Miller Samuel. By contrast, overall median prices in Manhattan have been down for four quarters in a row. “There is clearly more strength at the higher end than the overall market,” Miller said.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Beyonce is coming to save the day for the weak December box office,"In this article Movie theaters will become a Bey Hive this December. Hot off the heels of a distribution deal to bring Taylor Swift’s filmed Eras Tour to cinemas, AMC Entertainment has partnered with Parkwood Entertainment to bring a documentary on Beyonce’s Renaissance album and tour to theaters. The film will appear in theaters on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays for around four weeks starting Dec. 1. Tickets will start at $22 for standard showtimes, with premium large format screens like IMAX and Dolby Cinema available for a higher fee. The movie will screen at a variety of theaters nationwide, including AMC, Regal and Cinemark , Cinepolis, Cineplex and Harkins. Beyonce’s appearance on the film calendar is a much-needed boon for the North American box office. The film industry is still in recovery mode after the pandemic and has seen fewer releases in recent years, leading to fewer ticket sales. “Early December is a historically slow period between the Thanksgiving and Christmas corridors with very few high-profile new releases,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “This year’s slate during that time was certainly a bit thin before Beyonce staked her claim. There’s no question, having her fans come out to support her music and artistry on the big screen will fill some of that gap and continue to change how the industry approaches rare but occasional dead zones on the calendar when Hollywood studios aren’t releasing blockbusters.” So far, the big releases during the month of December are dominated by three Warner Bros. titles — “Wonka” hits theaters Dec. 15, followed by “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” on Dec. 20 and “The Color Purple” on Christmas Day. Those offerings give Beyonce’s movie plenty of room to run at the box office. “The cultural impact, brand enhancement and, of course, revenue-generating potential is clearly a motivating factor in the decision to go with a theatrical rather than a streaming release,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. It’s unclear what Beyonce’s film could open to in December, as tickets just went on sale Monday. Industry observers expect Swift’s concert film, due in theaters Oct. 13, will open to at least $100 million in ticket sales. By the end of Swift’s international tour dates next year, music analysts predict the star’s Eras Tour will have generated between $1 billion and $1.4 billion in revenue. Beyonce’s tour looks to top out just above $560 million. The Beyonce and Swift releases also are part of AMC’s new revenue-generation strategy. The theater chain, in bypassing the traditional studio release model, will pick up distribution fees as well as share in the ticket sales. AMC, in particular, needs this kind of revenue, as the company continues to spend more on film-licensing costs and theater rentals than it makes in ticket and concession sales. In fact, the company only recently posted a profit during its second quarter this year, having generated net income of just $8.6 million. “This is another savvy move by creators and exhibitors that bolsters the bottom line for movie theaters at year’s end while uncovering more unexplored potential from specialty event releases,” Robbins said. AMC, and other movie theater chains, will also benefit from elevated concession sales as moviegoers load up on popcorn and soda for these concert films. AMC is already promoting collectible Taylor Swift popcorn tubs for $14.99 and cups for $11.99. No doubt, Beyonce-themed items will be revealed soon. “The theaters have been playing live or recorded concerts for over a year now and began talking about alternative content possibilities two years ago, but the scale of Taylor Swift and Beyonce is certainly bringing more attention to this strategy,” said Alicia Reese, analyst at Wedbush. “It will be difficult to find other acts of this scale, but there are plenty of artists who will be touring next summer and theaters will likely be reaching out to schedule concert films to fill any gaps in the 2024 summer release slate.” Those gaps have come from production delays related to the two Hollywood labor strikes. The box office saw several titles leave for 2024 release dates and its still unclear where currently scheduled titles will wind up once the dust settles.",CNBC
Melissa Repko,"Macy’s will open up to 30 stores, as it looks to strip malls for growth","In this article Macy’s on Tuesday said it will open up to 30 smaller stores in strip malls over the next two years, as the retailer chases customers out of dying malls and into bustling suburbs. The company did not announce locations, but said the additional stores will start to open next year. The expansion marks an inflection point for the department store operator, which has looked for ways to refresh its legacy brand, cope with dwindling mall traffic and compete with retailers that have stolen away shoppers. Macy’s has faced even more challenges in the past six months, as middle-income Americans — who drive most sales at its namesake stores and website — watch their spending and rack up debt on their credit cards. The company cut its full-year forecast this summer and expects weak sales to persist. Chief Stores Officer Marc Mastronardi said small-format stores are part of the solution. Macy’s has tested the shops, which are roughly one-fifth the size of its traditional mall stores, for nearly four years. The stores offer a slimmed-down mix of merchandise, host local events, and have a more modern and open look. Plus, they’re next to big-box stores, grocers and popular off-price retailers like TJX -owned T.J. Maxx. “The high level of convenience in places that have a lot of traffic — that’s been the secret sauce,” Mastronardi said. The off-mall stores have put up stronger results than the rest of Macy’s. And based on the company’s own shopper surveys, the stores get high marks for being easy to shop, neat, and staffed by helpful and friendly employees, Mastronardi said. Macy’s small-format stores open for more than one fiscal year have posted comparable sales growth on an owned-plus-licensed basis from the beginning of the fiscal year, which began in late January, through the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 29. Comparable sales, a retail industry metric, aims to take out the impact of store openings, closures and renovations to allow better year-over-year comparisons. Across the rest of the company, comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis declined by roughly 7% in both the fiscal first quarter and fiscal second quarter. Along with Macy’s namesake stores, that metric includes trends at higher-end department store Bloomingdale’s and beauty chain Bluemercury, which have generally outperformed the namesake stores. By the end of this year, Macy’s will have 15 of the smaller stores, not including the announced expansion. Three are Bloomie’s, a smaller version of the Macy’s-owned Bloomingdale’s. The up to 30 new stores that are coming will be called Macy’s. The company is phasing out Market by Macy’s, the name it initially used for the smaller Macy’s stores. Macy’s has dealt with the skepticism from investors who often link its fate with those of struggling shopping malls. Shares of the company have largely been on a downward trend since 2015. So far this year, the company’s stock is down about 44% even as the S&P 500 has risen about 12% during the same time period. Led by CEO Jeff Gennette, the company has focused on five growth drivers, including off-mall expansion. It has also refreshed and debuted new private brands, launched a third-party marketplace online, focused on luxury brands, and increased personalized offers and communication with customers. Gennette will soon pass the reins to Tony Spring, CEO of Bloomingdale’s, as he retires early next year. Oliver Chen, a senior equity research analyst at Cowen who covers retail and luxury goods, said Macy’s is under pressure to appeal to younger consumers and differentiate from competitors. Those rivals include specialty retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora and off-price retailers or fast-fashion players where shoppers may get a better deal or superior service. ″[Macy’s leaders] don’t have their head in the mud,” he said. “They understand the need to be relevant and grow and to think about off-mall.” He pointed to some signs of progress, including the return of Nike and Under Armour merchandise to stores and its website and the launch of a new women’s private brand, On 34th. Shoppers who have come to the smaller stores look similar to Macy’s typical customer, but have a more curated mix of merchandise to choose from since stores are smaller, Mastronardi said. Popular categories at the small-format stores have been toys, beauty and career apparel, according to the company. Macy’s has opened the stores in three different kinds of markets. In some cases, it has put them in areas that already have a large store, but also have high demand. It has used others to replace stores in floundering malls. Macy’s has also broken into new regions where it does not have stores. Mastronardi said the company has tracked sales data in markets where Macy’s has a typical mall store and an off-mall store. He said the retailer has not seen signs of the new shops cannibalizing its existing stores, where sales just move from one to the other. “What we’re seeing is it’s really just an extra visit into the Macy’s brand,” he said.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,Krispy Kreme puts Insomnia Cookies up for sale as it doubles down on doughnuts,"In this article Krispy Kreme is exploring strategic alternatives, including an all-cash sale, of its majority stake in Insomnia Cookies, the company said Tuesday. The decision is part of an effort to focus more on its core doughnut business, the company said. Krispy Kreme acquired control of Insomnia Cookies in 2018 in a deal backed by European investment firm JAB Holding. The deal valued Insomnia Cookies at less than $500 million, sources told CNBC at the time. “We acquired a majority stake in Insomnia Cookies to build our e-commerce and digital capability as well as assist Insomnia’s U.S. and International expansion,” said Krispy Kreme CEO Mike Tattersfield in a statement. “Both efforts have been successful and it’s time for the next strategic step for both companies.” Krispy Kreme went public for the second time in 2021, at an implied valuation of $2.7 billion. The doughnut chain first went public in 2000 but was taken private in a sale to JAB Holding in 2016. Insomnia Cookies, which is known for serving cookies well into the early morning hours, has tripled its revenue since 2017, Krispy Kreme said Tuesday. The cookie chain has expanded from more than 135 locations in 2018 to 250 locations today. The cookie chain was founded in 2003 by University of Pennsylvania student Seth Berkowitz, who is CEO of Insomnia Cookies. The bakeries are often found near college campuses to feed the cravings of students staying up late into the night. “It has been an honor to partner with Krispy Kreme in an unprecedented chapter of growth for Insomnia Cookies,” Berkowitz said in a statement.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,Drugmakers opt in to Medicare drug price negotiations – here’s what happens next,"In this article All drugmakers of the first 10 medicines selected for Medicare drug price negotiations have agreed to participate in the talks, even after many of them sued to halt the process last month. The companies confirmed their participation in separate statements to CNBC on Monday. The White House on Tuesday confirmed that all drugmakers agreed to engage in the price talks. “Today I can announce that the manufacturers of ten drugs are coming to the negotiating table to lower prices,” President Joe Biden said in a video on X, formerly known as Twitter. “They’re taking steps to participate in the negotiating program so we can give seniors the best possible deal.” Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which passed last year, empowered Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time in the program’s six-decade history. The lengthy negotiation process won’t end until August 2024, with reduced prices going into effect in January 2026. Sunday was the deadline for all 10 pharmaceutical companies to sign an agreement to engage in the negotiations, which aim to make costly medications more affordable for older Americans. Monday, meanwhile, is the deadline for those companies to submit economic and market information on their drugs, including research and development costs and sales and revenue data.  Here are the 10 drugs and the companies that manufacture them:  Many of the drugmakers contend that they had no real choice but to participate in the negotiations, specifically due to the penalties they could face if they choose not to. If drugmakers decline to engage in the negotiations, they could be forced to pay an excise tax of up to 95% of their medication’s U.S. sales or to pull all of their products from the Medicare and Medicaid markets, according to CMS. “We have no choice other than to sign the ‘agreement.’ If we did not sign, we’d be required to pay impossibly high penalties unless we withdraw all of our medicines from Medicare and Medicaid. That is not a real choice,” a spokesperson for Bristol Myers Squibb told CNBC ahead of the Sunday deadline. That statement echoes the arguments outlined in at least nine separate lawsuits drugmakers filed against the Biden administration in recent months seeking to declare the negotiations unconstitutional. The pharmaceutical industry also argues that the process will threaten revenue growth, profits and drug innovation. However, analysts expect minimal financial losses for companies, at least initially, since most of the drugs selected already face upcoming patent expirations that will likely weigh on revenue. This fall, CMS will host one meeting with all 10 companies so they can provide context for the data they submitted by Monday.  CMS will also host listening sessions with consumer and patient organizations to obtain information the agency can use to develop its initial price offers for the selected drugs.  CMS will then make an initial price offer to manufacturers in February, and the companies have a month to accept or make a counteroffer.  The negotiations will end in August, with agreed-upon prices published on Sept. 1, 2024. The reduced prices won’t go into effect until Jan. 1, 2026. After the initial round of talks, CMS can negotiate prices for another 15 drugs for 2027 and an additional 15 in 2028. The number rises to 20 negotiated medications a year starting in 2029 and beyond. CMS will only select Medicare Part D drugs for the medicines covered by the first two years of negotiations. It will add more specialized drugs covered by Medicare Part B, which are typically administered by doctors, in 2028.  The drug price talks are expected to save Medicare an estimated $98.5 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  The negotiations are also anticipated to save money for people enrolled in Medicare, who take an average of four to five prescription drugs a month and increasingly face out-of-pocket costs that many struggle to afford.

Sarah Whitten,Late-night shows return as actors restart negotiations with Hollywood studios,"In this article Now that the Hollywood writers’ strike is over, late-night hosts are preparing their first opening monologues since May, and actors are going back to the negotiating table with studios. After nearly 150 days on the picket lines, the Writers Guild of America struck a tentative deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers last week, allowing writers to return to work and striking actors to start up their negotiations. WGA membership is currently in the process of voting on the contract, with expectations that ratification will come late next week. The first people to return are late-night heavyweights Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert on Monday, followed by John Oliver, host of “Last Week Tonight,” on Sunday. Meyers, host of “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” spent much of his pre-strike shows commenting on former President Donald Trump’s compounding legal problems. He noted that his first show back will be an hourlong “Closer Look” segment, a recap of news items. “I’m so excited to be back, but I didn’t pay attention to the news at all the last five months ... I hope I didn’t miss like three indictments,” Meyers joked on “Today” Monday. The WGA secured pay increases in each of the next three years, artificial intelligence restrictions and a new residual system for streaming based on viewership. The guild also negotiated higher contribution rates to health benefits and pensions, as well as a guaranteed number of writers in writers rooms for television shows. Now it’s the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists’ turn. The actors guild begins its negotiations with the likes of Disney, Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday. SAG-AFTRA is looking to improve wages, working conditions and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV. The guild is also looking to standardize the self-tape process. Industry players expect the negotiations will be quick, with the WGA deal as a template. Still, even if a tentative agreement is reached in the next few weeks, Hollywood will be slow to restart production on films and television shows. Not only will SAG-AFTRA members need to vote on the new contract, which could take a week or more, but there will be a scramble to gather crews and cast back to their respective sets. In a situation that would be similar to the return from pandemic restrictions, productions will be competing for studio space, locations and talent schedules. This could become increasingly tricky as the holiday season approaches, a time when production typically slows down. In addition, productions that were shooting internationally during the strike, like Warner Bros.′ “Beetlejuice 2,” Universal’s “Wicked,” and Disney and Marvel’s “Deadpool 3,” may need to wait for those crews to wrap up projects before returning to work on U.S.-based productions. Some studios have already indicated they will wait until next year to resume production. This means that post-production processes will also be delayed — including, editing and special effects. It’s unclear what impact that could have on the release calendar for upcoming film and TV shows. Already, Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment’s “Dune: Part Two” fled to 2024 as did Sony’s “Kraven the Hunter” and “Ghosbusters: Afterlife” sequel. And much of the reason “Dune: Part Two” departed the calendar was because its cast could not promote the film during the strike. Once SAG-AFTRA makes a deal with the AMPTP, those stars will be able to return to late-night shows to drum up interest for films. That could be particularly important for Academy Award hopefuls set for release later this year. In the meantime, late-night hosts will look elsewhere for guests. Meyers said viewers can expect to see politicians, journalists and authors as guests on the show until actors are permitted to promote their upcoming projects. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is a member of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. NBCUniversal is the distributor of “Wicked” and “The Late Show with Seth Meyers.”",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Oddity expects revenue growth up to 31%, according to preliminary Q3 results","In this article Oddity Tech released preliminary third-quarter results on Monday that show expected revenue growth of 29% to 31%, driven by repeat sales at its Il Makiage and Spoiled Child brands. The newly public retailer, which started trading on the Nasdaq in July and uses artificial intelligence to develop products, had previously expected sales to grow by about 20.5% in the three months ended Sept. 30.  The Tel Aviv-based company didn’t share its exact sales figure for the quarter, but in the year ago period, it posted $68.9 million in revenue, finance chief Lindsay Drucker Mann told CNBC. The company is also now expecting a gross margin of 68.5% for the period, one percentage point higher than its previous guidance of 67.5%, and margins on its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to be at the high end of its previous range. Oddity is now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 21% to 21.5%, compared to its initial guidance of 20% to 21.5%.  So far this year, sales have jumped by about 58% with adjusted EBITDA of at least $89 million, Oddity said.  “It was strength across the board, upside from both Il Makiage and Spoiled Child. At the end of the day, our repeat revenues were stronger than we had expected and importantly, those sales were of very high quality so they came with some very strong profitability associated with them,” Drucker Mann said in an interview.  “We have these machine learning models at almost every part of the user journey. They’re responsible for the high satisfaction, which leads to our great repeat rates, it drives our strong profitability and our high growth. Without these models, we would never be able to print these results, we would just be another unprofitable [direct-to-consumer] company.”  Oddity is on a mission to disrupt the legacy beauty and wellness industry by using AI to not just select products for customers, but to develop them as well. It often boasts that it doesn’t hire from the legacy beauty industry and instead focuses on recruiting technologists, many of whom came from the Israeli Defense Forces’ best technology units. In April, it announced plans to acquire biotech startup Revela and open the Boston-based Oddity Labs in a bid to make cosmetics that address age-old problems like hair loss and wrinkles. The lab is tasked with using AI to create brand-new molecules – a common tool used in the pharmaceutical industry to create new drugs, but one that isn’t widely used in the beauty and wellness industry.  In a statement, CEO Oran Holtzman said Oddity Labs is expanding faster than expected and “delivering game changing ingredient innovation.” The company expects Oddity Labs to have 10 products ready for market in 2024. Over the next five years, it expects Oddity Labs to drive 30% or more of the company’s overall revenue, said Drucker Mann.  When Oddity first debuted on the public markets over the summer, it began trading with a 35% pop and saw its stock close at $47.53. Soon after, it reached a high of $56 per share but since then, Oddity’s stock has fallen by about 50%, with shares closing at $28.08 on Monday. Drucker Mann said Oddity’s share price, along with the share price of other companies that recently went public, reflects “the natural ebb and flow of risk sentiment in the early stages of a market recovery.” “Momentum can drive the short term, but fundamentals drive the long term and our fundamental story is super exciting, so we’re feeling really confident,” she said.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,"FCC enforces first space debris penalty in $150,000 settlement with Dish","In this article The Federal Communications Commission announced a settlement with Dish Network on Monday in the regulator’s first penalty related to space debris. Dish admitted it was liable for failing to properly dispose of the EchoStar-7 broadcast communications satellite, and agreed to pay a fee of $150,000, the FCC said. The FCC called the agreement “a breakthrough settlement” in the increasingly concerning realm of space debris, brought on by governments and companies launching satellites into orbit at an unprecedented rate. “As satellite operations become more prevalent and the space economy accelerates, we must be certain that operators comply with their commitments,” FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Loyaan Egal said in a statement. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. Dish launched the EchoStar-7 satellite in 2002 and planned to remove it from service in May 2022. But a few months before then, Dish found the satellite did not have enough fuel remaining to navigate to a disposal location. The company had previously agreed to an “orbital debris mitigation plan” with the FCC to relocate the satellite. Instead of retiring the satellite 300 kilometers away from where it was operating in geostationary orbit, Dish retired the satellite about 122 kilometers away, “well short of the disposal orbit,” the FCC noted. Dish did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on the settlement.",CNBC
John Rosevear,Rivian reports better-than-expected EV deliveries for the third quarter,"In this article Rivian Automotive on Monday reported record third-quarter electric vehicle deliveries and said it remains on track to produce 52,000 EVs in 2023. The company said it delivered 15,564 vehicles during the period, up 23% from the second quarter of 2023 and ahead of Wall Street estimates. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected Rivian to deliver about 14,000 vehicles in the quarter, on average. Rivian produced 16,304 vehicles during the third quarter, all at its factory in Normal, Illinois. Shares ended the day down over 2% on Monday. The company also confirmed that it remains on track to build 52,000 vehicles in 2023, in line with its previous guidance to investors. Rivian currently builds a series of delivery vans for Amazon as well as its own R1T pickup and R1S SUV. All are fully electric vehicles. Rivian took several steps earlier this year to reduce spending and bolster its balance sheet, including a 6% staff reduction in February and a $1.3 billion sale of convertible notes in March. The company also delayed the launch of its upcoming smaller R2 vehicle platform to 2026, from 2025. It had $10.2 billion in cash on hand as of June 30, its most recent update. Rivian will announce its third-quarter earnings result after the U.S. markets close on Nov. 7.",CNBC
Amelia Lucas,Fast-food drive-thru lanes speed up as fewer drivers wait in line,"Fast-food drive-thru lanes are speeding up as fewer customers choose to order their meals and milkshakes sitting in their car, according to an annual study by Intouch Insight released Monday. The average total time spent in a drive-thru lane shrank 29 seconds this year. Wait times to order were 25 seconds shorter, as the average number of cars in line to place orders fell from 2.76 to 1.27. The Intouch Insight study was based on visits to nearly 1,500 locations of Arby’s, Burger King, Carl’s Jr., Chick-fil-A, Dunkin’, Hardee’s, KFC, McDonald’s, Taco Bell and Wendy’s. Mystery shoppers ordered from the drive-thru lanes during a range of times between June and July. Taco Bell, KFC and Carl’s Jr. had the fastest overall times for their drive-thru lanes. But Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s and Wendy’s bested all three chains when their longer average total times were divided by the number of cars in line. In other words, Carl’s Jr and Yum Brands’ Taco Bell and KFC were only speedier because their drive-thru lanes weren’t as popular. But across the board, drive-thru lanes have waned in demand since the Covid-19 pandemic began. At that time, customers shifted from ordering inside to ordering from their cars. The trend continued even as fast-food restaurants reopened their dining rooms. But the surge in popularity put pressure on workers to assemble orders quickly and accurately, and fast-food chains had to come up with solutions such as curbside pickup for mobile orders to address the problem. Despite those efforts, this year’s total drive-thru times still lag 2019 times by 15 seconds. Many diners have now shifted to ordering online or using self-order kiosks inside restaurants. Even as drive-thru visits stabilize, restaurant companies such as McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A are still working to speed up service and reduce errors. Some are testing artificial intelligence software to take orders or are building new locations with as many as four drive-thru lanes. Intouch Insight’s mystery shoppers visited two special restaurants this year: a McDonald’s test restaurant outside of Fort Worth, Texas, with an order-ahead lane and a drive-thru lane, along with a Taco Bell location in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, with one traditional drive-thru lane and three additional lanes reserved for delivery drivers and customers who ordered ahead. Both locations’ service times outperformed their broader brands’ times by roughly a minute. The Taco Bell restaurant also outperformed on order accuracy with a score of 88%, versus the chain’s rate of 85%. But the McDonald’s test location fell short with an accuracy score of 80%, well below the chain’s rate of 88%.",CNBC

Amelia Lucas,Big Food vs. Big Pharma: Companies bet on snacking as weight loss drugs boom,"In this article For more than a century, frosted cornflakes have been the backbone of Kellogg’s business. That changes Monday, when the company will spin off its stable cereal business in favor of its faster-growing snack unit and rename itself Kellanova. The spinoff comes weeks after another wager that consumers will graze between meals, when J.M. Smucker bought Twinkie maker Hostess Brands for $5.6 billion in a bid to expand its snack lineup. But food companies’ major bets on snacking come as investors fear the looming danger of Big Pharma’s blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Many investors have high hopes for the pharmaceuticals’ future, but their success could mean slower sales for the companies that produce Oreos, Doritos and Hershey’s Kisses. Big Food’s bet on snacking began roughly a decade ago, and it’s only accelerated as the rest of the grocery aisles see sales stagnate, particularly as prices rise. The U.S. market for savory snacks is expected to grow 6% annually from 2022 through 2027, and sweet snacks’ sales are expected to rise 4.6% annually during that time, according to HSBC. Roughly three-quarters of consumers plan to snack every day, according to Accenture data. Millennials and Generation Z consumers are fueling the trend. Younger generations snack more often than older consumers, said Kelsey Olsen, food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel. Millennials and Gen-Z consumers tend to eat smaller meals that are closer together, creating more occasions to grab a snack. At the same time, Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy have taken off, fueled by prescriptions to help patients lose weight. The drugs, known as GLP-1 agonists, suppress appetites by mimicking a gut hormone. Some patients even report developing aversions to foods with higher sugar and fat content — a category that includes many big snack brands. More than 9 million prescriptions for these kinds of drugs were written in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to a Trilliant Health report. Morgan Stanley estimates that the number of patients taking GLP-1 drugs could reach 24 million, or nearly 7% of the U.S. population, by 2035. If so, consumption of baked goods and salty snacks could fall 3% — or even more if the new eating habits of the people using the treatments extend to their broader households and friends, according to Morgan Stanley’s research. That puts companies like Hershey , Mondelez , PepsiCo , General Mills and Kellogg’s successor Kellanova at risk. But not everyone in the industry agrees with that assessment. After buying Hostess Brands, Smucker CEO Mark Smucker defended the future of Twinkies and Ding Dongs against the threat of GLP-1 drugs. “There are multiple ways that consumers will continue to snack. … And given that consumers are going to continue to seek all different types of snacks, and sweet snacks are going to continue to be on the radar, we view that our projections here are sound,” he told analysts on a conference call. For one, GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic are expensive, with a list price of roughly $1,000 a month. That high price has led some insurers to decide not to cover the treatments. While some of the nation’s largest insurers, like CVS’s Aetna, cover prescriptions of these drugs, the federal Medicare program, many state Medicaid programs and some commercial insurers don’t, leaving patients to pick up the bills themselves. Another factor could work in the favor of snack sales. Many of the consumers who eat the most junk food likely won’t be able to afford Wegovy or Ozempic. “Consumption of indulgent salty snacks that would be considered ‘junk food’ generally over-indexes toward lower-income individuals, who are unlikely to be these drugs’ primary users, ” RBC analyst Nik Modi said in a research note Tuesday. Modi wrote that he doesn’t believe the drugs will ultimately be problematic for the manufacturers of salty snacks. What’s more, patients have to inject themselves once a week, and if they stop taking the treatments, their effects disappear, usually erasing any weight loss that had occurred over time. “This sort of drug is super interesting in what it can do, but I think until it comes in a radically different formulation, in a pill or something like that, and something that has enduring impact and obviously the much lower price point, I think it’s going to be tricky,” said Oliver Wright, senior managing director of Accenture’s consumer goods and services unit. Even if the drugs become more affordable and are more widely adopted, the change won’t happen overnight. Food companies will have time to adjust to shifting consumer behavior. “We acknowledge that the impact in the near term is likely to be limited given drug adoption will grow gradually over time, but we could see a longer-term impact as drug prevalence increases,” Morgan Stanley’s Paula Kaufman wrote in a note to clients. “Moreover, we expect companies to adapt to changes in consumer behavior through innovation and portfolio reshaping efforts.” That may mean slower sales growth than expected and moves to divest some brands. But Big Food has been making strides toward healthier options anyway. GLP-1 drugs could just put more pressure on companies to update their portfolios. PepsiCo and Mondelez are among the companies that have snapped up smaller brands that make healthier snacks. Still, growing them into global powerhouses will take time. Food companies are also looking internally, investing in their research and development teams to create new formulations that mirror the taste of their full-sugar and salt versions. “My prediction is, before the end of the decade, we will have a healthy Oreo that can be put on a plate with an old one, and consumers won’t be able to tell them apart — and that will be a good thing,” Accenture’s Wright said. — Annika Kim Constantino contributed reporting for this story.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,Federal judge declines to block Medicare drug price negotiations,"A federal judge on Friday declined to block the Biden administration from implementing Medicare drug price negotiations, upholding for now a controversial process that aims to make costly medications more affordable for older Americans. Judge Michael Newman of the Southern District of Ohio issued a ruling denying a preliminary injunction sought by the Chamber of Commerce, one of the largest lobbying groups in the country, which aimed to block the price talks before Oct. 1. That date is the deadline for manufacturers of the first 10 drugs selected for negotiations to agree to participate in the talks. The Chamber sued the Biden administration in June, arguing that the drug negotiations violate the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the separation of powers. “As to Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, they have demonstrated neither a strong likelihood of success nor irreparable harm. Consequently, their request for immediate preliminary injunctive relief...is denied,” Newman, a nominee of former president Donald Trump, wrote in his 28-page order. But Newman also declined to grant the Biden administration’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. Instead, he asked the Chamber to amend its complaint by Oct. 13 to clarify certain details in the case. Newman also gave the Biden administration until Oct. 27 to renew its motion to dismiss the case. He said “a final determination on standing issues will be made following a short (60-day) discovery period and—assuming they are filed—renewed motions to dismiss.” The ruling from Newman is a blow to the pharmaceutical industry, which views the process as a threat to its revenue growth, profits and drug innovation. President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in a party-line vote last year, gave Medicare the power to directly hash out drug prices with manufacturers for the first time in the federal program’s nearly 60-year history The Chamber, which represents some companies in the industry, and drugmakers like Merck and Johnson & Johnson filed at least eight separate lawsuits in recent months seeking to declare the negotiations unconstitutional. But the Chamber’s suit was the only one seeking a preliminary injunction.  The Chamber’s lawsuit argues that the program violates drugmakers’ due process rights under the Fifth Amendment by giving the government the power to effectively dictate prices for their medicines. The Chamber said an appeals court established a precedent that when the government sets prices, it must provide procedural safeguards to ensure a company receives a reasonable rate and fair return on investment. It stems from the 2001 case Michigan Bell Telephone Co. v. Engler, according to the Chamber. The Medicare negotiations do not provide these safeguards and impose price caps that are well below a drug’s market value, the Chamber argued. “There is a very, very high risk, maybe a guarantee, but certainly a very, very high risk, that this regime will result in prices that are unfair,” Jeffrey Bucholtz, an attorney for the Chamber, told judge Newman during a hearing earlier this month. He added that drugmakers either must agree to the price the government sets, or face an excise tax of up to 1,900% of U.S. sales of the drug. But lawyers for the DOJ said during the hearing that the program was far from compulsory. Drugmakers can choose the alternative to those two options: Withdraw their voluntary participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, according to attorney Brian Netter.  “The measure of relief here is for manufacturers to decide whether they want to stay in the program under the terms that are on offer,” Netter said. “If they choose not to, that’s their prerogative.” The other suits are scattered in federal courts around the U.S. Legal experts say the pharmaceutical industry hopes to obtain conflicting rulings from federal appellate courts, which could fast-track the issue to the Supreme Court.  Medicare covers roughly 66 million people in the U.S., according to health policy research organization KFF. The drug price talks are expected to save the insurance program an estimated $98.5 billion over a decade, the Congressional Budget Office said.  In August, the Biden administration unveiled the 10 drugs that will be subject to the first round of price talks, officially kicking off a lengthy negotiation process that will end in August 2024. The reduced prices for those initial medications won’t go into effect until January 2026. That includes blood thinners from Bristol-Myers Squibb and J&J, and diabetes drugs from Merck and AstraZeneca . It also includes a blood cancer drug from AbbVie , one of the companies represented by the Chamber of Commerce. ",CNBC
Michael Wayland,Ford CEO says UAW is ‘holding the deal hostage’ over EV battery plants,"In this article DETROIT — The United Auto Workers union is holding up negotiations with Ford Motor over future electric vehicle battery plants, Ford CEO Jim Farley said during a press briefing Friday. “I believe we could have reached a compromise on pay and benefits, but so far the UAW is holding the deal hostage over battery plants,” he said after the UAW announced it would expand strikes to two additional assembly plants — one each for Ford and General Motors. Farley criticized the union for its targeted strike strategy, saying he feels the actions were “premeditated” and insinuating the union was never interested in reaching a deal before a Sept. 14 deadline. “We have felt from the very beginning, between all the lines of our comments, that the original strike was premeditated and that everything is taking way too long,” he said. “That actual events are predetermined before they happen. It’s been very frustrating.” Farley’s public criticism of the union is uncharacteristic for Ford, which is historically viewed as the most union-friendly company of the Detroit automakers. Farley said the company isn’t “at an impasse” with the union but warned that day “could come if this continues.” GM CEO Mary Barra echoed much of Farley’s criticisms of Fain and the UAW’s strike strategy. “It’s clear that there is no real intent to get to an agreement,” she said in an emailed statement Friday night. “It is clear Shawn Fain wants to make history for himself, but it can’t be to the detriment of our represented team members and the industry.” UAW President Shawn Fain fired back at Farley, saying the CEO hasn’t been present at the bargaining table and that he’s “lying about the state of negotiations.” “It could be because he failed to show up for bargaining this week, as he has for most of the past ten weeks. If he were there, he’d know we gave Ford a comprehensive proposal on Monday and still haven’t heard back,” Fain said in a statement Friday afternoon. “He would also know that we are far apart on core economic proposals like retirement security and post-retirement healthcare, as well as job security in this EV transition, which Farley himself says is going to cut 40 percent of our members’ jobs.” Multibillion-dollar EV battery plants — and their thousands of expected workers — are crucial to the automotive industry’s future and uniquely positioned to have wide-ranging implications for the UAW, automakers and President Joe Biden’s push toward domestic manufacturing. Current and former union leaders previously told CNBC that the battery plants will have to be a priority for the labor organization, regardless of whether they’re directly discussed in the national agreement, for the long-term viability of the union. However, they’re considered a “wild card” issue in the contract negotiations. Many of the battery plants that have been announced cannot legally be included in the current talks, as they are joint venture facilities. Ford has announced four future battery plants, including three joint ventures and a wholly owned subsidiary using battery technology licensed from Chinese auto supplier CATL. Ford earlier this week paused construction on the latter plant in Marshall, Michigan, due to the union negotiations, Farley said. “We can make Marshall a lot bigger or a lot smaller,” Farley said Friday. GM is the only Detroit automaker with a joint venture battery plant in operation and unionized — making it the first in the country to face this particular negotiating dynamic and a landmark plant to set standards for the industry. Farley noted that some of the battery production won’t even be covered under the timeline of the deals that are currently being negotiated. He also defended the company’s prior offers, which include more than 20% hourly wage growth, reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments, job protections and other benefits. “If the UAW’s goal is a record contract, they have already achieved this,” Farley said. “It is grossly irresponsible to escalate these strikes and hurt thousands of families.”",CNBC
Drew Richardson,"Blue Apron to be acquired by Wonder Group, capping tumultuous post-IPO ride","In this article Meal kit business Blue Apron announced Friday it has agreed to sell itself to food and restaurant company Wonder Group, founded by entrepreneur Marc Lore, for $103 million. The deal, at $13 per share, represents a significant premium from Blue Apron’s per-share price at Thursday’s close of $5.49. The sale caps years of ups and downs for Blue Apron, once a leader in at-home meal deliveries. In recent months, the company has transitioned to become a more asset-light business, selling its operational infrastructure to California-based meal provider FreshRealm for $50 million and laying off significant swaths of its workforce. “The Blue Apron brand and products that our customers know and love will stay the same, with more opportunity for product expansion in the future,” Blue Apron CEO Linda Findley said in a statement Friday. Blue Apron has long been mired in strategic difficulties since its mid-2010s heyday. The company was founded in 2012, billing itself as an easier way to prepare home-cooked meals. Boxes arrived at the customer’s doorstep with pre-portioned ingredients and recipes to create their chosen dishes. The company specifically targeted working professionals in large cities who may have less time to grocery shop and cook. In 2015, the company secured $135 million in funding from big name backers including Fidelity Investments at a valuation of $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The company even turned a profit in the first two quarters of 2016, wowing potential investors ahead of an eventual IPO. Blue Apron went public in June 2017 at $10 a share and a valuation of about $1.89 billion. The company initially forecasted a range of $15 to $17 per share, but lowered its projected per-share price following Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced just weeks before the IPO. Blue Apron stock gained little ground on its opening day. By then, the tide had already begun to turn for the meal kit business. Blue Apron reported a loss of $52 million in the first quarter of 2017 on $245 million in revenue. That single quarter of losses rivaled the company’s full-year deficit from 2016 of $54.9 million. Competition intensified for Blue Apron, as other meal kit businesses popped up on the scene like HelloFresh and Home Chef. Blue Apron still dominated 40.3% of the market, Verge reported at the time, but had lost 17% of its share since September 2016. HelloFresh trailed behind at 28% market share. Shortly after the IPO, a number of shakeups took place within the company’s top executives. Co-founder and then-Chief Operating Officer Matthew Wadiak stepped down from his post less than a month after the IPO, and CEO Matt Salzberg was replaced by chief financial officer Brad Dickerson later that year, while Salzberg became executive chairman. By the end of 2017, the situation looked bleak: The company said in its 2017 year-end report that it had lost 15% of its customer base year over year, citing decreased marketing spend. Net losses in 2017 amounted to $210 million. By December of the following year, shares of Blue Apron had dipped below $1 per share, and the company was at risk of getting delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Investors were reportedly spooked by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, high marketing expenses, and fulfillment center issues. In early 2020, reports surfaced that Blue Apron was considering going private. Soon after, the company announced the closure of its Arlington, Texas, facility and the furlough of 240 employees as part of an effort to build “operational optimization and fiscal discipline to support our strategy and return to growth.” CEO Linda Findley acknowledged during the company’s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call that the board was evaluating several strategic options to “maximize shareholder value.” Shares of Blue Apron traded for less than $4 apiece at the time, even after a reverse stock split to boost the per-share price. But shortly thereafter, the Covid pandemic took hold and lockdowns kept people at home, breathing new life into the company. Blue Apron shares rallied from mid-March to mid-April 2020, jumping 400%. But as the pandemic waned and demand for at-home meals slumped, Blue Apron sought out third-party partnerships to capture new customers. It began offering its meal kits on Walmart .com and opened up its preexisting Amazon partnership to include those without a Prime subscription . Even so, the company continued to struggle, reporting a net loss of $109.7 million for 2022. Enter, Wonder Group. The company began making waves in May 2021, operating a fleet of faceless vans in Westfield, New Jersey. Wonder’s goal was to deliver fine dining options to residents of the New York City suburb. Vans were retrofitted as kitchens to cook and deliver the food to the customer. The company partnered with restaurants to recreate their menu in an effort to save affluent suburbanites from having to go into the city to eat their favorite fine dining options. By 2023, Wonder had abandoned the food truck concept, instead opting for a food hall restaurant concept that offers several menus within the same store. Similar to the food truck concept, Wonder has licensing deals with other well-known restaurants to prepare their foods in Wonder locations. Last year, Wonder raised $350 million at a $3.5 billion valuation, according to the Wall Street Journal. For now, Wonder has indicated that Blue Apron will operate more or less the same. “Wonder plans to continue Blue Apron’s current operations serving customers nationwide under the Blue Apron brand, with expected new synergies between consumer-facing apps and delivery logistics,” Blue Apron said Friday. “At home meals play a key role in this vision,” Wonder CEO Marc Lore said on Friday. “When the opportunity presented itself to unite with Blue Apron, pioneers in the meal kit industry, we knew it would accelerate our strategic position.”",CNBC
Leslie Josephs,United Airlines pilots approve new contract with up to 40% raises,"In this article United Airlines pilots approved a new contract with compensation increases of as much as 40.2% over the four-year contract, making the carrier the last of the three largest U.S. airlines to seal a deal with its aviators during an industry shortage. The deal is worth about $10 billion, according to the Air Line Pilots Association, the pilots’ union. ALPA said on Friday that the new contract won 82% approval from the more than 97% of United pilots that voted on it. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines pilots approved new contracts earlier this year, also with big raises. The Covid-19 pandemic derailed negotiations across airlines but pilot and other labor unions in the industry have been pushing hard for increased compensation and better work rules since travel demand bounced back and inflation surged. Other unions are also pushing for improved pay and benefits, calling for strikes or potential strikes when negotiations fall short of demands. The United Auto Workers union is planning on expanding strikes against General Motors and Ford Motor to two U.S. assembly plants on Friday, UAW President Shawn Fain said. Earlier this week, Hollywood writers and studios finalized the language of a deal that ended a nearly 150-day labor strike.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,"UAW announces new strikes at GM and Ford plants, spares Stellantis","In this article DETROIT – The United Auto Workers union will expand strikes against General Motors and Ford Motor to two U.S. assembly plants at noon ET, UAW President Shawn Fain said Friday. The additional strikes will target Ford’s Chicago Assembly Plant in Illinois, which produces the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs, and GM’s Lansing Delta Township plant in mid-Michigan that produces the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse crossovers. The plants are important ones for the companies, however not as profitable or crucial as facilities that produce the automakers’ pickup trucks. Fain said Chrysler parent Stellantis was spared from additional strikes because of recent progress in negotiations with that company. “Moments before this broadcast, Stellantis made significant progress on the 2009 cost-of-living allowance, the right not to cross a picket line, as well as the right to strike over product commitments and plant closures and outsourcing moratoriums,” said Fain, who was delayed nearly 30 minutes in making the online announcement. “We are excited about this momentum at Stellantis and hope it continues.” About 6,900 autoworkers will take part in the latest wave of work stoppages, joining roughly 18,300 workers who are currently on strike for the union. That means about 25,200 employees, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, will be on strike as of noon. “To restore the balance of power, we have to restore the strike,” Fain said Friday, citing several other UAW strikes aside from the Detroit automakers. GM in a statement Friday said it had yet to receive a “comprehensive counteroffer” from union leadership to a contract proposal made last week. “Calling more strikes is just for the headlines, not real progress. The number of people negatively impacted by these strikes is growing and includes our customers who buy and love the products we build,” Gerald Johnson, GM’s head of global manufacturing, said in the statement. “We’re here to reach an agreement so we can all get back to work, and that remains our 100% focus.” Stellantis, in a statement, said while negotiators have made progress, “gaps remain.” The company said it is “committed to continue working through these issues in an expeditious manner to reach a fair and responsible agreement that gets everyone back to work as soon as possible.” Ford CEO Jim Farley said mid-Friday afternoon the UAW is “holding the deal hostage over battery plants,” calling the additional strike “grossly irresponsible.” He also criticized the union for its targeted strike strategy, saying he feels the actions were “premediated” and insinuating the union was never interested in reaching a deal before a Sept. 14 deadline. Fain fired back at Farley, saying the CEO hasn’t been present at the bargaining table and that he’s “lying about the state of negotiations.” The additional strikes come one week after a similar strike expansion. The UAW originally initiated work stoppages on Sept. 15 at three assembly plants — one each for the Detroit automakers. Last week, the union targeted a further 38 parts and distribution locations operated by GM and Stellantis. At that time, the UAW spared Ford from expanded strikes, citing progress in those negotiations. Fain previously said the union would increase the work stoppages, based on progress in the contract negotiations. The talks have spurred frustrations and accusations from both sides of the bargaining table. Before the Friday announcement, GM and Stellantis in particular had grown increasingly frustrated by a lack of participation from Fain and what they said were delays in receiving counterproposals from the union, people familiar with the negotiations told CNBC. Unlike past strikes, UAW leaders opted for targeted strikes at select plants instead of initiating national walkouts. It’s calling the work stoppages “stand-up strikes,” a nod to historic “sit-down” strikes by the UAW in the 1930s. The strategy is in an effort to keep the automakers on edge in an effort to pit them against one another to achieve better contracts, according to private messages leaked last week involving the UAW’s communications director. The messages, which described a strategy to cause “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” for the companies, were heavily criticized by the automakers.",CNBC
Leslie Josephs,"JetBlue raises flight attendant pay, union agrees to support merger with Spirit","In this article JetBlue Airways said it will raise flight attendant pay next year and provide other bonuses to staff while the union representing cabin crews agreed to support the carrier’s plan to acquire budget carrier Spirit Airlines . Starting in November, flight attendants will get 5% raises. Including another 2% raise, a slate of other incentives and previously negotiated raises under flight attendants’ union contract, their raises in 2026 will compound to 21.5% increases, according to a company memo, which was seen by CNBC Friday. The raises come as the New York-based carrier is in the process of trying to acquire Spirit, a merger the Justice Department has sued to block. A trial for that lawsuit is set to begin on Oct. 16 in Boston. JetBlue agreed not to furlough or displace any flight attendants or close any associated bases for seven years after a potential acquisition of Spirit goes through, the memo said. “The current contract was negotiated during COVID, and since then our inflight crewmembers pay rates have fallen below other airlines by a significant margin,” a JetBlue spokesman said in a statement. “Because our inflight crewmembers play a significant role in delivering the JetBlue experience, it’s important that we’re able to attract and retain high-quality crewmembers with competitive pay and benefits.” The union said it would, in turn, support the planned acquisition of Spirit. “With this agreement made by your TWU Local 579 Executive Board and JetBlue, we support the JetBlue and Spirit transaction and will not hold an additional informational picket or speak publicly against the acquisition,” the union said in a note to members. JetBlue also agreed to additional pay for staff that fly the carrier’s trans-Atlantic routes and in its Mint business-class cabin, as well as other incentives, according to a letter of agreement with the Transport Workers Union, which represents JetBlue’s 7,000 flight attendants.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,Shares of Structure Therapeutics surge on promising obesity pill data,"In this article Shares of Structure Therapeutics rose more than 30% on Friday after the biotech startup’s experimental obesity pill succeeded in a small early-stage trial.  The once-daily drug helped overweight or obese participants reduce up to 10 pounds of weight on average after four weeks of treatment, according to a release from the company. Structure said it plans to test its pill in two longer midstage trials as a treatment for diabetes and obesity. Structure’s pill is part of the same class of drugs as Novo Nordisk ’s blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and weight loss counterpart Wegovy.  Those treatments, known as GLP-1s, have soared in popularity this year due to their ability to help patients lose unwanted pounds. GLP-1s mimic a hormone produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite.  Companies like Structure are trying to capitalize on the booming obesity drug industry, which analysts say could be a $100 billion global market by the end of the decade.  Structure’s pill could potentially compete with oral obesity drugs from Eli Lilly , Novo Nordisk and Pfizer , which are not approved in the U.S. yet. Analysts say the arrival of cheaper, more convenient pill versions of the GLP-1s could increase access for patients and expand the market for obesity drugs. Pills are easier to manufacture than injections, making them less likely to run into the supply shortages plaguing injectable drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro. Pills are also typically cheaper than injections, though it’s unclear if that will be the case with the obesity treatments.  Wegovy’s list price tops $1,300 per monthly package, and Ozempic’s is about $935. Novo Nordisk has a diabetes pill called Rybelsus, which has the same list price as Ozempic for a monthly package of 30 tablets.",CNBC

Hugh Son,Citigroup CEO Fraser sees ‘cracks’ emerging among some consumers as savings ebb,"In this article Lower-end consumers have shifted buying patterns to save money as their bank accounts dwindle in size, according to Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets has been monitoring its credit card customers for signs of distress, Fraser told CNBC’s Sara Eisen on Friday in an interview. “We are paying attention to the lower FICO consumer, where there are cracks” forming, Fraser said, referring to the widely used credit-scoring system from Fair Isaac Corp. “I think some of the excess savings from the Covid years are getting close to depletion.” The U.S. government injected trillions of dollars into households and businesses during the pandemic to avert disaster, money that has helped keep the economy humming for longer than many forecasters expected. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s most aggressive interest rate hiking cycle in four decades has made credit card, mortgage and auto debt more expensive, and late payments and defaults have been climbing. When asked what other CEOs are telling her about the state of the economy, Fraser said that besides comments on artificial intelligence and labor tightness, corporate leaders have told her that demand is softening, she said. “Particularly [for] the bottom end of the consumer, that’s the one that we’re starting to see cracks, you’re seeing some shift in the buying patterns to lower categories in the spend,” Fraser said. “It’s a resilient consumer, but it’s a softer one.” Softening demand may help the Fed in its battle with inflation, the CEO noted. While employment and gross domestic product figures suggest the economy will achieve a “soft landing,” if it does tip into recession, it will likely be a “manageable” one, Fraser said. In the wide-ranging interview, Citi’s CEO also said her latest overhaul of the bank was a move away from the “financial supermarket” model of the past into a more streamlined operation. The scope of job cuts and expense savings triggered by the reorganization will be disclosed with fourth quarter-earnings, she said.",CNBC
Laya Neelakandan,Toys R Us is planning a brick-and-mortar comeback in the U.S.,"Toys R Us is plotting a bold comeback in the U.S., as it plans to expand its brick-and-mortar presence with as many as 24 new flagship stores and a separate rollout at airports and on cruise ships starting this holiday season. The toy retailer’s parent company, WHP Global, announced what it called the “Air, Land and Sea” expansion on Friday. Toys R Us aims to start opening the up to two dozen flagship stores as early as next year in partnership with Go! Retail Group. The company plans to roll out the locations in “prime cities” that complement its current retail footprint, WHP said. The first airport store is set to open in November, in time for the holiday season, in Terminal A of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the world’s second-busiest airport. “The Toys R Us brand is growing fast and our expansion into air, land and sea is a testament to the brand’s strength,” said Yehuda Shmidman, chairman and CEO of WHP, in a statement. The expansion plan continues a slow revival of the once ubiquitous brand. Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in 2017, though it could not come out of it on its own, pushing it into liquidation. In January of that year, the company operated 1,691 stores and licensed 257 stores across 38 countries, according to an SEC filing. WHP acquired a controlling interest in Toys R Us’ parent company, Tru Kids, in 2021. The company planned to open more Toys R Us stores across the country, after the brand’s only two remaining locations in the U.S. closed earlier in 2021. At the time, Shmidman said he hoped to open a combination of flagship, pop-up and airport stores as the country emerged into a post-Covid retail landscape. In summer 2021, WHP announced a rollout of more than 400 new Toys R Us stores at Macy’s locations across the country. In a Friday statement, Shmidman said the company has increased Toys R Us’ global footprint by more than 50% since the acquisition, with upward of 1,400 stores and e-commerce sites across 31 countries. One of those stores is its current flagship two-level store at the American Dream megamall in New Jersey. The 20,000 square foot location includes experiences for kids such as a two-story slide, café and ice cream shop. WHP told CNBC the new flagship stores will be modeled after the American Dream location with “immersive” shopping experiences. But the New Jersey store will likely remain the largest location. The expansion also will bring stores to airports and cruise lines as the company looks to keep up with the rise of travel retail. The first-of-its-kind store at the Dallas airport, in a partnership with Duty Free Americas, will allow customers to shop for their favorite toys and regional merchandise before hopping on a flight, and the company also plans to offer a range of toys and cruise-themed merchandise for that industry. The Toys R Us brand generates more than $2 billion in global retail sales annually, WHP said.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Drugmakers spent nearly $500 million on ads for obesity, diabetes drugs in 2023","In this article Drugmakers spent nearly $500 million on advertisements for obesity and diabetes treatments in the U.S. during the first seven months of this year, up 20% from the same period a year ago, according to new data released Friday.  The data, from advertising analytics firm MediaRadar, demonstrates the rush by companies to capture new customers after months of hype around Novo Nordisk ’s diabetes drug Ozempic and weight loss counterpart Wegovy.  Those drugs and similar treatments have soared in demand this year for their ability to help patients lose unwanted pounds. The medicines, known as GLP-1s, mimic a hormone produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite.  U.S. health-care providers wrote more than 9 million prescriptions for Ozempic, Wegovy, and other obesity and diabetes drugs during the last three months of 2022, up 300% from early 2020. MediaRadar compiled ad spending from national TV broadcasts, print publications, newspapers and websites, and social media platforms from Jan. 1, 2022 to July 31, 2023.  The top four drugs advertised were Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, Wegovy and diabetes pill Rybelsus and Boehringer Ingelheim’s own diabetes treatment Jardiance, which is set to face drug price negotiations with the federal Medicare program.  Together, those treatments accounted for $358 million, or about three-quarters, of total ad spending for obesity and diabetes drugs during the first seven months of this year, according to the data.  Spending on Ozempic ads was $120 million during that time period, up 23% from the same period last year. MediaRadar said in a statement that Ozempic’s rise in popularity has had a “positive impact on similar medications.”  “It’s a classic case of ‘a rising tide lifts all boats,’” MediaRadar CEO Todd Krizelman said in the statement. “As Ozempic’s popularity grows, so does the demand for other weight loss and diabetes drugs, especially Wegovy, which has made a significant mark this year, particularly from Q2 onwards.” Wegovy accounted for more than $20 million in ad spending during the first seven months of the year, primarily due to a spike in spending from April to July, according to MediaRadar.  But MediaRadar noted that Novo Nordisk in May paused some key promotional advertising for Wegovy, specifically local and national TV advertising.  MediaRadar said most of the spending on the drug was for digital advertising, such as online video. ",CNBC
Michael Wayland,Automakers grow frustrated over pace of UAW negotiations as new strike deadline looms,"In this article DETROIT – Tensions are rising and accusations are flying between the Detroit automakers and United Auto Workers, as the union threatens to expand U.S. plant strikes – marking two weeks of work stoppages and the dwindling likelihood of an imminent breakthrough. The UAW is expected to announce additional strike targets at 10 a.m. ET Friday, barring substantial progress in negotiations with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis for contracts covering some 146,000 autoworkers. UAW President Shawn Fain will host a Facebook Live event then to update members on the talks and identify additional strike locations, a source familiar with the talks said. In the run-up, frustrations remain around key economic demands and what some see as a lack of urgency by the union to reach a deal, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private. Specifically, GM and Stellantis have grown increasingly frustrated by a lack of participation from Fain and what they say are delays in receiving counterproposals from the union, some of those sources said. The union set a new Friday deadline before holding any high-level meetings between Fain and the companies, the people said, raising questions about the union’s commitment to reaching a deal and ending the strikes. As of the Wednesday announcement, the UAW also hadn’t put forth counterproposals to offers made by the automakers roughly a week earlier, the people said. The first high-level, “main table” talks between the union with Fain and the two automakers came only after that Wednesday announcement, in a late-afternoon meeting the same day with GM, without CEO Mary Barra, and a midday Thursday meeting with Stellantis, the sources said. The union Thursday afternoon confirmed it submitted a counteroffer to Stellantis during the meeting – giving the company less than 24 hours to respond ahead of the fresh deadline. The lack of urgency is increasingly frustrating company negotiators, many of whom are more accustomed to around-the-clock bargaining to get a deal as soon as possible, the sources said. Such talks have been few and far between as Fain attempts to negotiate with all three companies at once, they said. Fain has consistently said the union is available to negotiate 24/7, however the automakers have questioned his availability and the union’s tactics broadly, particularly in light of leaked private messages in which the UAW’s communications director, Jonah Furman, described keeping the companies “wounded for months.” A UAW spokesman declined to comment on the strategy, including on the union waiting a week to respond and giving Stellantis less than 24 hours to respond. Concerns around the pace of talks follow similar claims by Fain and the union. Before initiating strikes on Sept. 15, Fain heavily criticized the automakers for failing to provide counteroffers to the union’s proposals, which were first delivered to the companies in early August. All three automakers say they’ve made substantial offers to the union. The deals on the table include hourly wage increases of roughly 20%, thousands of dollars in bonuses and enhancements to the workers already-substantial benefits packages. Ford, for its part, has offered to reinstate prior cost-of-living adjustments to offset inflation. But the UAW has demanded more, including 40% wage increases, an end to the “tier” system under which new hires spend several years working up to full wages, a 32-hour workweek, and benefits including additional time off and assurances about electric vehicles. About 18,300 workers, or roughly 12.5% of the UAW members covered by its contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike. In recent days, union members on the picket lines have reported confrontations, intimidation with guns, hit-and-run vehicle accidents, and vandalism of vehicles and company property. Five people suffered minor injuries when they were hit by a vehicle that drove through the UAW’s picket line while leaving a GM parts facility in Flint, Michigan, on Wednesday. The vehicle was driven by a third-party contractor doing work for GM at the facility. GM issued a statement saying that three contractors, including the driver, had been banned from its properties. It urged its other contractors and salaried employees to follow established safety procedures when crossing a UAW picket line. Separately, Stellantis released a statement on Thursday accusing the UAW of mischaracterizing other incidents that did not – contrary to statements by Fain – involve replacement workers, or so-called scabs. “Since the UAW expanded its strike to our parts distribution centers last Friday, we’ve witnessed an escalation of dangerous, and even violent, behavior by UAW picketers at several of those facilities, including slashing truck tires, jumping on vehicles, following people home and hurling racial slurs at dedicated Stellantis employees who are merely crossing the picket line to do their jobs,” the statement said. The company said it has not hired any outside workers to replace striking UAW members: “Only current employees who are protecting our business and third parties making pick-ups and deliveries as they normally would are entering our facilities.” The company called on Fain and other UAW leaders to help ensure the safety of all Stellantis employees, including those on the picket line.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,"Blue Origin, Sierra Space weigh future of Orbital Reef space station","The Orbital Reef space station partnership between Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Sierra Space is on rocky footing, CNBC has learned. The companies announced Orbital Reef as a co-led project in 2021, but updates about the project dried up in the past year. The pair of private space companies are now navigating a potential end to the Orbital Reef partnership, according to three people who spoke to CNBC about the situation. Those people, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic matters, emphasized that discussions are ongoing and described the situation as fluid. But other development projects with more significant current contracts – such as Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lunar lander and Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser spaceplane – have taken higher priority for both companies, those people said. It’s becoming increasingly likely that Blue Origin and Sierra Space will go their separate ways, leaving behind joint efforts to develop Orbital Reef, according to those sources. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. Shortly after unveiling the Orbital Reef project, Blue Origin won a $130 million contract from NASA for design work on the private space station. That contract was one of three funded Space Act Agreements (SAA) that NASA issued for the first phase of its Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. Blue is the prime contractor under that NASA award, with Sierra as a subcontractor. NASA spokesperson Rebecca Wickes told CNBC in a statement that the agency has so far paid Blue Origin $24 million of the total contract amount for completing specified milestones. As of yet “there are no current plans to transfer the agreement,” Wickes said. Sierra did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment on Orbital Reef. Neither did Blue Origin, but the company, shortly after being reached by CNBC, posted on social media that it is making “progress on our Commercial Destinations Space Act Agreement with NASA.” “Our team is currently testing window frames and materials in a relevant space environment,” Blue Origin said, without mentioning Orbital Reef by name. Blue originally unveiled Orbital Reef alongside Sierra, envisioning a “mixed use business park” in space. The first major pieces of Orbital Reef were scheduled to launch in 2027, with the companies aiming to begin service around the time the International Space Station retires near the end of the decade. Habitable space stations have long been an interest for Blue Origin, with Bezos’ vision for the company to create a future where “millions of people are living and working in space to benefit Earth.” Similarly, Sierra has been developing an habitat concept for years, known as LIFE (“Large Integrated Flexible Environment”). Several companies are also working to build private space stations, with competing projects being led by Axiom, Voyager Space, Northrop Grumman and Vast. The Orbital Reef team also includes Boeing , Redwire , Amazon , Genesis Engineering Solutions, and Arizona State University underneath Blue and Sierra. Orbital Reef is not seen as a top priority for either company, according to three people familiar with the companies. Two of those sources pointed CNBC to a shift in Blue Origin’s interests after the company won a $3.4 billion NASA contract to build a crew lunar lander – noting its space station and lunar lander programs compete for resources in the same business unit. Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith is leaving at the end of the year and new leader Dave Limp will need to execute on other major projects – including its New Shepard and New Glenn rockets, as well as its BE-4 engine production. Similarly, much of Sierra’s resources are devoted to getting the initial cargo variation of its reusable Dream Chaser spaceplane flying. It has been developing Dream Chaser for more than a decade, under contract to fly cargo for NASA to the International Space Station. The company earlier this week raised $290 million in new funding and hopes to fly Dream Chaser to the ISS for the first time next year. There have been signs the Orbital Reef project was unraveling: The website for the project, created jointly by Blue and Sierra, hasn’t published an update on the station’s development in more than a year. As of Thursday, neither company’s careers websites have job openings that mention “Orbital Reef,” despite having dozens of listings mention the project in the past. And Sierra Space dropped references to Orbital Reef in its most recent press releases, focusing solely on its own habitat work. From NASA’s viewpoint, changes to the structure or involvement of different companies in the first phase of a project like this one are not surprising. For example, Northrop Grumman didn’t rejoin Blue Origin’s team when the company bid a second time for a crew lunar lander. And, more relevant to the CLD program, another space station project called Starlab saw Airbus take the place of Lockheed Martin as the core habitat’s builder. For its part, Sierra has continued to test and develop LIFE – an inflatable module that made up a major part of the Orbital Reef architecture. Sierra has regularly posted updates about milestones in testing habitats, such as a recent “burst” testing of a sub-scale prototype. Last month, Sierra announced plans to launch a “pathfinder” demonstration mission of its LIFE (Large Integrated Flexible Environment) habitat in 2026.",CNBC
Melissa Repko,"GameStop’s survival demands ‘extreme frugality,’ CEO Ryan Cohen tells employees","In this article Just hours after being named GameStop ’s CEO, Ryan Cohen sent out a memo to employees Thursday that emphasized he will take dramatic steps to ensure the struggling video game retailer survives. “Our job is to make sure GameStop is here for decades to come,” he wrote in the email that was sent to corporate employees and store leaders and obtained by CNBC. “Extreme frugality is required. Every expense at the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated. The company has no use for delegators and money wasters. I expect everyone to treat company money like their own and lead by example.” Cohen, a billionaire activist investor and founder of direct-to-consumer pet food and supply retailer Chewy , was named the company’s new leader Thursday morning. He was previously executive chair of GameStop. As of late June, his firm RC Ventures was the company’s largest shareholder with a 12.09% stake, according to FactSet. Cohen’s CEO announcement previewed the company’s emphasis on slashing costs: He will not receive a salary in his new role. Cohen became an integral part of the “meme stock” frenzy, as he invested in companies including now bankrupt Bed Bath & Beyond. He joined GameStop’s board in 2021 in the thick of the phenomenon. Cohen’s new role kicks off the latest chapter of GameStop’s effort to reinvent itself. The Grapevine, Texas-based retailer, which was founded in the 1980s, built its business on selling video games, consoles and other gaming merchandise. Yet as customers buy video games online, it has fallen from relevance and had to chase new ways make money. It has experimented with new businesses, such as launching an NFT marketplace and striking a partnership with now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The company has also dealt with major leadership changes. With Cohen on its board, GameStop tapped multiple Amazon veterans, including Matt Furlong, who became CEO, and Mike Recupero, who became chief financial officer. Yet GameStop fired both of those leaders. Cohen got the top job nearly four months after the company ousted Furlong. GameStop shares closed at $16.84 on Thursday and have fallen nearly 9% this year. The closing price was less than a quarter of its all-time high close of more than $86 a share in January 2021. Earlier this month, GameStop reported a second-quarter net loss of $2.8 million, compared to a $108.7 million loss in the prior-year period. -- Read the full memo below: Subject: Survival   I will be straight to the point.   It is not sustainable for GameStop to operate a money losing business. The mission is to operate hyper efficiently and profitably. Our expense structure must allow us to endure any adverse scenario. Whether it’s a difficult economy or revenue deceleration from shrinking software, we must be profitable. Our job is to make sure GameStop is here for decades to come. Extreme frugality is required. Every expense at the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated. The company has no use for delegators and money wasters. I expect everyone to treat company money like their own and lead by example.   Prospering in retail means survival. If we survive, we stay in the game. Survival is avoiding the deadly sins that often lead retailers to self-destruct. This is usually a result of the following - buying bad inventory, using leverage, and running expenses too high. By avoiding these self-inflicted mistakes and focusing on the basics, GameStop can be here for a long time.   I expect everyone to roll up their sleeves and work hard. I’m not getting paid, so I’m either going down with the ship or turning the company around. I much prefer the latter.   It won’t be easy. Best of luck to us all.   Ryan This story is developing.

Lillian Rizzo,"Endeavor, Fenway Sports consider investment in the PGA Tour","In this article The PGA Tour is attracting potential outside investors — some of which are considering making a rival pitch to the Saudi-backed Public Investment Fund’s proposal, according to people familiar with the matter. Endeavor Group Holdings and Fenway Sports Group are considering investing in the PGA Tour, potentially to rival or coincide with the PIF’s proposed deal, said the people, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the discussions. The discussions, which are in preliminary stages, stem from a PGA Tour investment vehicle created as part of the framework agreement for its proposed deal with PIF. “Throughout 2023, the PGA Tour has demonstrated its strength, reach and value as an enterprise. Our focus continues to be on finalizing an agreement with the Public Investment Fund and the DP World Tour, however, our negotiations have resulted in unsolicited interest from other investors,” said a PGA Tour spokesperson. Representatives for Endeavor and Fenway declined to comment. Bloomberg earlier reported that Endeavor and Fenway were mulling a rival offer. In June, the PGA Tour announced a proposed deal that would see it combine with rival LIV Golf following months of lawsuits and competition between the two. The PIF, which is controlled by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, finances LIV. Under the framework agreement, the tour would hold a permanent controlling interest in the new entity’s board of directors and would maintain that majority share regardless of PIF’s investments. PIF has said it would invest billions into the entity and hold a noncontrolling minority stake. Specifics of the deal and its valuation are still being discussed. The tour’s board, including player directors, have to sign off on an eventual definitive agreement. Ultimately, the tour and its members will make the decision on the final investment structure, and whether it includes or is led by PIF or alternative investors, one of the people said. The deal between LIV and the PGA Tour has faced criticism and controversy. It is currently under investigation by a Senate subcommittee. The Saudis have been accused of “sportswashing” to take the focus off the kingdom’s history of human rights violations. Endeavor recently was behind the combination of its UFC and World Wrestling Entertainment, a newly merged publicly traded company now called TKO . Fenway is an investment firm that backs several major sports franchises, including Major League Baseball’s Boston Red Sox, the Liverpool Football Club and the National Hockey League’s Pittsburgh Penguins.",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,Nike misses revenue expectations for the first time in two years,"In this article Nike reported revenue Thursday that fell short of Wall Street’s sales expectations for the first time in two years, but it beat on earnings and gross margin estimates, sending its stock soaring in after-hours trading. Here’s how the sneaker giant performed during its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended August 31 was $1.45 billion, or 94 cents per share, compared with $1.47 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $12.94 billion, up about 2% from $12.69 billion a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter was just shy of the $12.98 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. Nike shares rose about 8% in extended trading Thursday. The retailer maintained its full-year guidance of revenue growth in the mid-single digits and gross margin expansion of 1.4 to 1.6 percentage points. “We’re closely monitoring the operating environment, including foreign currency exchange rates, consumer demand over the holiday season, and our second half wholesale order book,” said finance chief Matthew Friend on a call with analysts. “We are cautiously planning for modest markdown improvements for the balance of the year, given the promotional environment,” he added. For the second quarter, Nike expects revenue growth to be up slightly versus the prior year and gross margins to grow by about 1 percentage point versus the prior year. Investors have been laser focused on Nike’s recovery in China, its relationship with its wholesale partners and how the resumption of student loan payments will impact sales.  They’re also keen to see Nike’s margins recover after bloated inventories, high promotions and supply chain woes contributed to lower profits over the last few quarters.  During the quarter, Nike’s gross margin fell about 0.1 percentage points to 44.2%, but it was higher than the 43.7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. The company attributed the gross margin drop to higher product costs and currency exchange rates, but those trends were offset by price increases, which contributed to the earnings beat. Sales in China grew by 5% compared to the year-ago period to $1.7 billion, which fell short of the $1.8 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. During the previous quarter ended May 31, Nike saw China sales jump 16% compared to the year-ago period. But the numbers were against easy comparisons because the region was still under Covid-related lockdown orders during the prior year.  While Nike remains bullish on China, the region’s economic recovery has so far been a mixed bag. Following a sluggish July, retail sales picked up during the month of August to rise 4.6% compared to the prior year, beating expectations of a 3% growth forecast by Reuters.  “We feel good about the market there and our position,” said CEO John Donahoe, adding he’s traveled to China twice in the last four months. “Frankly, a couple things stand out. One, sport is back in China, you can just feel it, and that gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment, regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there.” Nike saw sales jumps in every region besides North America, its largest market by revenue. Sales in North America fell 2% from the year-ago period to $5.42 billion, just above the $5.39 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales were up 8% at $3.61 billion. That compared with the $3.51 billion analysts had expected. Sales in its Latin America and Asia Pacific unit came in 2% higher at $1.57 billion, just shy of the $1.59 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. The Converse brand, on the other hand, fell well short of expectations for a second quarter in a row. Sales came in at $588 million, down 9% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts had expected sales to be about $660 million, according to StreetAccount. Nike’s direct channel, which includes its owned stores and its digital channel, led the retailer’s growth during the quarter and was up 6% compared to the prior year. In June, the company noticed that shoppers were shifting towards its stores over its digital channels, signaling consumers are getting closer to pre-pandemic shopping habits. “We continue to see that consumers want to connect directly and personally with our brands and in fact, member engagement within our direct business is up double digits versus the prior year with increasing average order values,” said Friend. “Our stores delivered an especially strong quarter with traffic up double digits from last year, and members driving an increasing share of our business as consumers shifted from our digital to physical channels... Our team was nimble in transitioning inventory to capture higher full-price sales across our entire store fleet,” he said. When it comes to its wholesale revenues, Nike’s relationship with those partners have been rocky. As the company has pivoted to a direct-to-consumer model, it has focused on driving sales online and in its stores at the expense of its wholesale accounts.  However, as Nike grappled with excess inventories throughout 2023, it relied on those partners to move through that merchandise. It has now restored its relationship with both Macy’s and DSW – accounts that it previously cut in favor of its DTC strategy.  Some analysts expected Nike’s wholesale revenue to be sluggish during the quarter because excess inventories have been a problem throughout the retail industry – and some wholesalers are being more particular in what they order to avoid another backlog.  Wholesale revenue during the quarter was flat compared to the year-ago period at $7 billion. Both Donahoe and Friend made it clear to analysts that Nike is ready to meet customers in all channels — including through wholesalers and directly. The retailer shouted out Dick’s Sporting Goods as one of its key partners and noted that it’s still in the process of resetting its business with Footlocker , which has seen two quarters in a row of plunging sales and profits. Despite the shift in how it’s working with wholesalers, Nike insisted that direct sales will pave the way to its future growth. “Ultimately, we have a segmented portfolio of strong partners across price points and channels. With no single partner representing more than a mid-single digit of Nike’s total business,” said Friend. “While the ultimate landing spot of digital and direct isn’t as clear, we do believe we’re going to be a more direct and a more digital company, and a more profitable company,” he said. “And there’s a channel mix and channel profitability opportunity that comes with that as well.” Meanwhile, inventories fell 10% to $8.7 billion. The drop was driven by a decrease in units but offset by product mix and higher manufacturing and production costs. “On the whole, we’re very comfortable with the level of inventory in the marketplace in relation to the retail sales that we’re seeing as we begin increasing levels of wholesale sell in our second half,” said Friend. Amid decades-high inflation rates, consumers have been pulling back on apparel and footwear. With the resumption of student loan payments looming ahead, some analysts expect those sectors to take an even greater hit.  Jefferies conducted a survey on U.S. consumer spending and found 54% of respondents plan to spend less on apparel and accessories. Meanwhile, 46% plan to spend less on footwear, which doesn’t bode well for Nike.  It’s still too early to gauge the impact of student loan payments on Nike. Its first quarter ended in late August, and payments aren’t set to resume until October. During the quarter, footwear sales rose 4% to $8.4 billion, making up about 68% of Nike’s total sales. Apparel was down 1% at $3.4 billion. Correction: Nike’s gross margin fell 0.1 percentage points. An earlier version of this story misstated that figure.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,NFL tells X it’s concerned about placement of ads on white nationalist accounts,"The National Football League on Thursday responded to a recent report that pointed out its ads were placed on white nationalist feeds on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, formerly known as Twitter. “NFL unequivocally denounces any form of hate speech and has absolutely no association with these individuals or any group that promotes racism,” NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy told NBC Sports’ Pro Football Talk. “As soon as this was brought to our attention, we immediately expressed our concerns to X to understand and rectify the issue.” The NFL did not indicate if it would pull ads from the platform, or if X would remove the ads from the white nationalist accounts. X’s press relations email responded with an automated response when CNBC asked for comment: “Busy now, please check back later.” Left-leaning media watchdog site MediaMatters.org first reported on the ad placements Wednesday. X shares a portion of ad revenue to owners of eligible accounts in which ads appear, if the owner opts in. Media Matters found five white nationalist accounts, with a total of one million followers, where NFL ads appeared. Since Musk bought the social media company last year, watchdog groups have criticized the company for failing to monitor and remove hate speech. X has fought back, suing the Center for Countering Digital Hate during the summer, arguing the group illegally accessed company data to claim that harmful content overwhelmed the platform. Earlier this month, the CCDH released a new report saying X continuously fails to remove hate speech and other harmful content from the platform despite being notified the content violated the platform’s hateful conduct guidelines. The NFL’s statement Thursday comes days after Brian Rolapp, the NFL’s chief media and business officer, praised X and its CEO, Linda Yaccarino. “They are doing great work innovating to make the platform better for @NFLfans and partners,” he posted on the platform. Yaccarino struggled to answer key questions regarding company matters, including hate speech and antisemitism, at Vox Media’s 2023 Code Conference on Wednesday. When asked about complaints regarding antisemitism on the platform, Yaccarino responded, “Everybody deserves to speak their opinion.”",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,"GameStop names Ryan Cohen as CEO effective immediately, won’t receive salary","In this article GameStop said Thursday morning that billionaire activist investor Ryan Cohen would take over as the video game retailer’s chief executive, chairman and president effective immediately — and he won’t be collecting a salary. Shares of the company fell 1.8%. GameStop’s board, with Cohen abstaining, unanimously voted to appoint the entrepreneur as the retailer’s top executive on Wednesday. Cohen had previously held the title of executive chairman but will step down from the role upon his latest appointment, according to a securities filing. Cohen won’t “receive any compensation” for his work, a news release said. The move comes more than three months after GameStop fired CEO Matthew Furlong, made Cohen executive chairman and appointed longtime company soldier Mark Robinson as its “principal executive officer” and general manager. GameStop didn’t give a reason for Furlong’s dismissal at the time, but it came just months after the company had reported its first quarterly profit in two years with Furlong at the helm. Several weeks later, the company announced that CFO Diana Saadeh-Jajeh was resigning. With the latest move, Cohen will also assume the role of principal executive officer from Robinson. He previously served as general counsel and secretary, and he added principal executive officer to his list of duties back in June. Now, he will resume as just general counsel and secretary, according to a securities filing. Cohen, who founded pet food retailer Chewy and has become known as the “king” of meme stocks, bought a stake in GameStop in 2020 and joined the board in 2021 – during the height of the meme phenomenon. As of late June, his firm RC Ventures was GameStop’s largest shareholder with a 12.09% stake, according to FactSet. Since Cohen joined the company, the business hasn’t shown many signs of a turnaround, albeit with some exceptions. Earlier this month, GameStop reported its second-quarter financial results, posting a narrower loss than it did a year ago, as well as a slight increase in revenue. Read the release here.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,SpaceX wins first Pentagon contract for Starshield military satellite network,"The Pentagon has awarded Elon Musk’s SpaceX its first confirmed contract for the Starshield network it’s developing, a military-specific version of the company’s Starlink satellite internet system, the defense agency said Wednesday. A Space Force spokesperson confirmed that SpaceX on Sept. 1 was awarded a one-year contract for Starshield with a maximum value of $70 million. The award came alongside 18 other companies through a program run by the Space Force’s commercial satellite communications office. “The SpaceX contract provides for Starshield end-to-end service (via the Starlink constellation), user terminals, ancillary equipment, network management and other related services,” Space Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek told CNBC. SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on the Starshield contract. The company unveiled Starshield last year as a new business line. The Pentagon is already a high-value buyer of the company’s rocket launches and had shown increasing interest in its Starlink satellite internet. SpaceX has given few details about the intended scope and capabilities of Starshield. It markets the service as the center of an “end-to-end,” dedicated offering for national security with capabilities distinct from its Starlink consumer and enterprise network. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. SpaceX’s award for Starshield follows its June win of a Pentagon contract to buy an undefined number of Starlink ground terminals for use in Ukraine. The initial phase of the Starshield contract obligates $15 million to SpaceX by Sept. 30, to provide services that support 54 military “mission partners” across Department of Defense branches, the spokesperson said.

Leslie Josephs,"Delta CEO says carrier went ‘too far’ in SkyMiles changes, promises modifications after frequent flyer backlash","In this article Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the airline will make “modifications” in the next few weeks to its loyalty program after a recently announced overhaul that would make it more expensive for many travelers to earn elite status and get into airport lounges was met with a backlash from customers. “No question we probably went too far,” Bastian said at the Rotary Club of Atlanta on Monday. The program changes, which Delta unveiled earlier this month, would reward customers with elite status based on how much they spent, a model similar to that of American Airlines , and reduce access to Delta popular airport Sky Club lounges for many American Express cardholders. JetBlue Airways tried to capitalize on some customers’ anger over Delta’s changes by offering frequent flyer status matching, saying, “we’ve made it easy for you to cozy up to a new loyalty program and see where it goes.” Delta has been grappling with a surge in elite travelers, bolstered by Covid pandemic and post-pandemic spending, and swarms of travelers trying to get into its lounges, leading to long lines for many customers. The airline and rivals including American and United have been racing to build bigger airport lounges to cater to swelling numbers of big spenders. Bastian said the airline will announce the updated program changes in the coming weeks. Spokespeople for both Delta and American Express said they had no further comments on the changes. “It’s gotten to the point, honestly, where we have so much demand for our premium product and services that are far in excess of our ability to serve it effectively in terms of our assets,” Bastian said. He said that over the Covid-19 pandemic, the airline doubled the number of Diamond Medallion status members. David Neeleman, founder and CEO of Breeze Airways and founder of JetBlue, told CNBC on Wednesday that he has Delta Diamond Medallion status and that he tries to use Delta’s airport lounges but that sometimes “there’s a big line and it’s not worth it.” Delta last year announced several changes to crack down on overcrowding at the clubs, such as barring employees from using them when flying standby with company travel privileges, even if they had qualifying credit cards. The Atlanta-based carrier also raised prices for club memberships for regular customers. “If everyone’s special, no one feels special,’” Bastian said in an interview with CNBC last December.",CNBC
Elliot Smith,Saudi soccer league says big-money player purchases are only the first step,"The big-spending Saudi Pro League is aiming to build its global broadcasting presence and become one of the top 10 soccer leagues in the world, its chief operating officer, Carlo Nohra, told CNBC on Thursday. The league dominated the sports headlines over the summer as Saudi clubs cumulatively spent more than $1 billion in transfer fees and attracted some of the biggest names from Europe’s top leagues with mammoth contract offers. Brazilian superstar Neymar and Senegalese forward Sadio Mane followed the previous arrivals of former Ballon D’Or winners Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, along with a host of other stars from the English Premier League, Spain’s La Liga, Germany’s Bundesliga, Italy’s Serie A and France’s Ligue 1. Speaking to CNBC at the APOS conference in Bali, Indonesia, on Thursday, Nohra said that Saudi Arabia’s strategy is “extremely long term,” but that the acquisition of players was the first step. “While that helps us grow on the pitch, the idea is to grow off the pitch and to commercialize as well, so the strategy takes in every element that we need to focus on to get the Saudi Pro League to where it aspires to be among the top 10 leagues in the world,” he said. The kingdom’s massive investment in sport is part of a broader effort to diversify its economy away from oil by investing in commercial infrastructure to become a tourism, leisure and entertainment powerhouse. It is also being used to bolster the country’s global reputation, with critics arguing that the ultimate aim of Saudi Arabia’s investment in soccer, golf, boxing, motor racing, and many other sport and entertainment ventures is to distract from its dismal human rights record. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a recent interview with Fox News, embraced accusations of “sportswashing” and said he did not care about the criticism, so long as the massive sporting investments ultimately yielded a positive contribution to Saudi GDP growth. Nohra explained that the objectives handed down to the Saudi Pro League’s bosses were to firstly improve on-pitch performance through the acquisition of world-class players, to fill the country’s stadia and ultimately to drive the commercialization of the vastly improved overall product. “We had a long, hard look at ourselves, we’ve discovered that we need to improve the governance of the league, we need to improve the product itself and the commercialization of that product, better understanding of our fans,” he said. “The player acquisition presented some issues that needed to be addressed, the clubs’ capabilities needed to improve so we’ve looked at that as well, and equally how we’re organized as a league in order to compete at the global level.” Along with the domestic revenues the government is hoping to generate through in-person match attendance, capitalizing on Saudi Arabia’s young population’s love of the sport, Nohra also said the Saudi Pro League was looking to expand its broadcast presence around the world. “Since the introduction of Cristiano Ronaldo into the league in January, we’ve seen global distribution expand to unprecedented levels for Saudi soccer, and through the acquisitions this summer, we’ve had renewals across the board with now the needle moving on the commercialization of those rights across the world,” he said. “So we’re delighted with where we are at the moment but we still need to continue to deliver for fans across the world what they now wish to have from Saudi football.”",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,"FAA closes Blue Origin rocket failure probe, requires 21 ‘corrective actions’","The Federal Aviation Administration closed its investigation into last year’s failed flight of a cargo mission by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, the regulator announced Wednesday. Blue Origin is required by the FAA to “implement 21 corrective actions,” the regulator said in a statement. The FAA noted that Blue Origin will not be clear to launch New Shepard until after Blue Origin implements “all corrective actions that impact public safety” and receives an updated launch license. “We’ve received the FAA’s letter and plan to fly soon,” a Blue Origin spokesperson said in a statement. The 21 required actions include the “redesign of engine and nozzle components to improve structural performance during operation as well as organizational changes.” The FAA did not comment further on specifics of the corrections. In September 2022, the company’s New Shepard rocket was flying a cargo mission when it suffered a failure. Earlier this year, Blue Origin said the source of the issue was an overheated part in the rocket engine’s nozzle. No people were onboard, as the NS-23 mission was carrying science and research payloads. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. Blue Origin said its investigation found that NS-23 flight’s engine failure was due to “operational temperatures that exceeded the expected and analyzed values of the nozzle material.” The company recovered fragments of the BE-3PM engine’s nozzle, finding “clear evidence of thermal damage and hot streaks resulting from increased operating temperatures.” The New Shepard rocket launches from Blue Origin’s private facility in West Texas, carrying people and payloads above 100 kilometers, or more than 340,000 feet, for a couple minutes of weightlessness. The capsule is flown autonomously, with no human pilot, and floats down with the assistance of a set of parachutes to land in the Texas desert. The New Shepard rocket booster is reusable, returning to land on a concrete pad near the launch site. To date, Blue Origin has flown 31 people past the edge of space with New Shepard. Blue Origin has said since March that it expects to return New Shepard to flight “soon.” The crucial re-flight of the rocket is planned to carry the same research payloads that didn’t make it to space on the NS-23 mission, without crew.",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Peloton shares soar on digital content, apparel partnership with Lululemon","In this article Peloton and Lululemon are joining forces. The two companies announced a five-year partnership Wednesday that will bring Peloton’s content to Lululemon’s exercise app. Lululemon in turn will become Peloton’s primary athletic apparel partner, and a select number of Peloton’s instructors will become ambassadors for the apparel retailer. The terms of the deal, and whether the two companies will share revenue, were not disclosed. Peloton’s stock jumped more than 15% in extended trading on the news. Shares of Lululemon — which has a roughly $48 billion market cap compared to Peloton’s $1.7 billion — were flat in after-hours trading. As part of the announcement, Lululemon said it plans to stop selling Mirror, which allows users to stream workout classes, by the end of the year. The company had been exploring a sale of the product after sales had come in below expectations and Lululemon was forced to take a $443 million impairment charge related to the equipment, the company said earlier this year. Peloton’s content will now be accessible through Mirror, it told CNBC, but the fate of the Mirror device and whether the division will be sold off remains unclear. Meanwhile, sales for Peloton’s connected fitness products have steadily fallen from their pandemic-era highs, so the company has zeroed in on content as its primary value proposition. Its partnership with Lululemon will mark the first time Peloton has shared that prized content with another company, aside from a smaller partnership with Delta Air Lines that offers meditation and movement classes for fliers. Lululemon’s app has about 13 million members, nearly double Peloton’s total global member count of nearly seven million. Under the agreement with Lululemon, Peloton will not have access to the members that are consuming its content. The news comes one day after Peloton announced co-founder and Chief Product Officer Tom Cortese is leaving the company. In May, CNBC spoke with Cortese and Peloton’s Chief Content Officer Jennifer Cotter about the company’s rebranding strategy and if it has any plans to partner with other businesses to offer its content. Cotter, the brains behind Peloton’s content machine, said “nothing’s ever off the table” but said “there’s no real need” for such a partnership. Cortese, for his part, made it clear partnerships weren’t on the horizon — at least in the short term. “That’s not going to happen,” Cortese replied. “One thing that has worked very well for Peloton in the past and will continue to work very well for Peloton going forward is our direct relationship with our members. We’re not going to lose our direct relationship with our members,” he continued. “It’s part of how we build community and how we build our business. There is no reason for us to have an intermediary between us and our members.” Cortese couldn’t be immediately reached for comment following news of the partnership.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,UAW again threatens to expand strikes if progress isn’t made by Friday,"In this article DETROIT — The United Auto Workers union will announce expanded strikes at General Motors , Ford Motor and Stellantis plants if the sides don’t make significant progress in negotiations by 10 a.m. ET Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. The new union-imposed deadline comes a week after the UAW announced it would expand its initial Sept. 15 strikes at assembly plants of each of the Detroit automakers to 38 additional parts and distribution locations for GM and Stellantis. The UAW did not expand its strikes at Ford , citing progress in those talks. Like a week earlier, it’s expected that UAW President Shawn Fain will host a Facebook Live event to announce which plants will walk out at noon Friday, barring progress in the talks. The strikes currently involve about 18,300 workers, or 12.5% of the UAW’s 146,000 members whose labor contracts expired on Sept. 14. Fain previously said the union planned to increase the work stoppages, based on how negotiations with the companies were going. The union is calling the work stoppages “stand-up strikes,” a nod to historic “sit-down” strikes by the UAW in the 1930s. Spokespeople for the Detroit automakers did not immediately respond for comment on Wednesday. The additional strike plans come despite record contract offers from the automakers that include roughly 20% hourly wage increases, thousands of dollars in bonuses, retention of the union’s platinum health care and other sweetened benefits. The union’s new deadline comes a day after President Joe Biden joined Fain and union members, becoming the first known sitting president to walk a picket line with striking autoworkers. Biden also voiced support for the union and its demands, including a 40% wage increase during the life of the contract. The UAW has further demanded a shortened workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, the elimination of compensation tiers and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, among other improvements. Unlike past strikes, UAW leaders opted for targeted strikes at select plants instead of initiating national walkouts. The strategy is in an effort to keep the automakers on edge in an effort to pit them against one another to achieve better contracts, according to private messages leaked last week involving UAW communications director Jonah Furman. The messages, which described a strategy to cause “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” for the companies, were heavily criticized by the automakers.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Merck, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers to engage in Medicare drug price negotiations","In this article Merck , AstraZeneca , Bristol Myers Squibb and Boehringer Ingelheim on Wednesday told CNBC they will agree to participate in the first round of Medicare drug price negotiations, even after all four drugmakers sued to halt the process last month. Merck’s Type 2 diabetes drug Januvia, AstraZeneca’s own diabetes drug Farxiga, Boehringer Ingelheim’s diabetes drug Jardiance and Bristol Myers Squibb’s blood thinner Eliquis are among the first 10 drugs selected for price talks with Medicare.  The four companies appear to be the first manufacturers to indicate that they will comply with the negotiations, which seek to rein in the rising costs of prescription drugs for older Americans.  Manufacturers of the other six drugs selected have until Oct. 1 to sign an agreement to participate in the process. Those companies did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment about their intentions. A spokesperson for Merck said in a statement that the company will sign the agreement to participate “under protest,” noting that it disagrees on “both legal and policy grounds” with the negotiations. But “withdrawing all of the company’s products from Medicare and Medicaid would have devastating consequences for the millions of Americans who rely on our innovative medicines, and it is not tenable for any manufacturer to abandon nearly half of the U.S. prescription drug market,” the spokesperson said. “The choice between doing so and weathering the [Inflation Reduction Act’s] massive fines and taxes is no choice at all.” If drugmakers decline to engage in the negotiations, they could be forced to pay an excise tax of up to 95% of their medication’s U.S. sales or to pull all of their products from the Medicare and Medicaid markets, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A spokesperson for Bristol Myers Squibb similarly said the company has “no choice other than to sign the ‘agreement’” due to the penalties outlined by CMS. An AstraZeneca spokesperson said the company remains “committed to ensuring patients have access to FARXIGA and plan to participate in the process outlined by CMS to communicate the value of FARXIGA to people covered by Medicare.” Boehringer Ingelheim, which is privately held, said in a statement it is “committed to engaging in open and transparent conversations” with CMS. Merck, Bristol Myers, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim and other drugmakers like Johnson & Johnson have filed at least eight separate lawsuits in recent months seeking to declare the negotiations unconstitutional. Another lawsuit from the Chamber of Commerce, one of the biggest lobbying groups nationwide, is seeking a preliminary injunction, which aims to block the negotiations before Oct. 1.  The pharmaceutical industry fiercely opposes the process because it believes it will threaten its revenue growth, profits and drug innovation. However, analysts expect minimal financial losses for companies, at least initially, since most of the drugs selected already face upcoming patent expirations that will likely weigh on revenue. For example, Farxiga will lose its market exclusivity in 2026, which will open up the market to generic alternatives. That’s the same year renegotiated prices are set to take effect. The Inflation Reduction Act, which narrowly passed Congress last year along party lines, empowered Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time in the program’s six-decade history. The law is the central pillar in the Biden administration’s efforts to control rising drug prices and was a major victory for the Democratic Party. The administration named the first round of drugs set to face price talks last month, kicking off a lengthy negotiation process that will end in August 2024.",CNBC
Stefan Sykes,Landmark marijuana financing bill clears big hurdle in the Senate,"A new bill that aims to give the marijuana industry access to banking services moved forward in the Senate on Wednesday. The Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation Banking Act was introduced by a bipartisan group of senators last week. The bill would provide legal protection to banks or other financial institutions that offer services to state-legal marijuana businesses. The Senate Banking Committee voted 14-9 to advance the measure to the full chamber’s floor. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat and lead sponsor of the bill, called its passage a “historic moment” and an “example of significant bipartisan cooperation.” “Forcing legal businesses to operate in all-cash is dangerous for our communities; it’s an open invitation to robberies, muggings, money laundering, and organized crime—and the only people benefiting from the current system are criminals,” said Merkley in statement. “I am committed to building bipartisan momentum to finally get a bill signed into law that ends the cannabis cash economy and improves public safety across the nation,” he added. The bill is also being led by Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.; and Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., as well as Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “This legislation will help make our communities and small businesses safer by giving legal cannabis businesses access to traditional financial institutions, including bank accounts and small business loans,” the senators said in a joint statement last week. “It also prevents federal bank regulators from ordering a bank or credit union to close an account based on reputational risk,” they added. Even as 39 states have legalized marijuana for recreational or medical use, the sector has struggled to scale. Marijuana’s classification as a Schedule I substance, or one with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, along with federal prohibition, pose a risk to banking institutions. This, in turn, has limited access to financing and a broader market. Moreover, without access to financial services, state-legal cannabis businesses are forced to operate their businesses solely using cash, which can result in robbery, money laundering and organized crime. Due to the opening of new adult-use markets in individual states, combined U.S. medical and recreational cannabis sales are expected to reach $33.6 billion by the end of 2023, according to analysis from the MJBiz Factbook from industry news outlet MJBizDaily. The landmark vote Wednesday marked the first time the Senate has considered the legislation. An earlier version of the bill, the SAFE Banking Act, passed in the House seven times previously but has never advanced through the Senate under both Democratic and Republican control. Late last year, lawmakers excluded it from a $1.7 trillion government funding bill. The bill may face a tougher path to passage if it ends up before the GOP-controlled House. “I think it probably passes the banking committee, but I think it doesn’t go anywhere in the House,” said Ian Katz, an analyst with Capital Alpha Partners who covers banking and financials. “Republicans seem to be souring on it,” he added. The new bill includes stricter requirements for federal regulators, such as prohibiting them from terminating any marijuana-related accounts without “valid reason,” or from denying banking services based on “personal beliefs or political motivations.”",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Ozempic, Wegovy drug prescriptions hit 9 million, surge 300% in under three years","In this article U.S. health care providers wrote more than nine million prescriptions for Ozempic, Wegovy and similar diabetes and obesity drugs during the last three months of 2022, according to a new analysis released Wednesday. The report, from analytics firm Trilliant Health, shows that quarterly prescriptions for those drugs increased 300% between early 2020 and the end of last year. Novo Nordisk ’s weekly diabetes injection Ozempic accounted for more than 65% of total prescriptions as of the end of 2022, and was primarily prescribed off-label for its ability to help patients lose weight.  The data further confirms the rise in demand for that group of drugs, which have fueled a frenzy among Americans and on Wall Street for their ability to cause significant weight loss. Those treatments, known as GLP-1s, mimic a hormone in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite.  But the rate of future prescription volumes will largely depend on whether manufacturers of those drugs, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly , can resolve widespread supply shortages affecting most of their treatments in the U.S., among other factors, according to the report. The analysis is based on insurance claims data for about 300 million Americans. Among the other drugs prescribed are Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro and an older GLP-1 drug from Novo Nordisk called Saxenda, which isn’t as effective for weight loss as Ozempic and Wegovy. But the total number of GLP-1 prescriptions is likely an undercount since some health plans don’t cover weight loss treatments like Wegovy, leaving some patients to pay for them out of pocket.  Some people, such as Hollywood celebrities and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, are wealthy enough to pay for the drugs themselves.  Ozempic’s list price tops $935 per monthly package, and its weight loss counterpart Wegovy is about $1,300. The drugs are meant to be taken indefinitely to keep weight off, just like cholesterol-lowering drugs or blood pressure medications that have to be taken for life.  Other drugmakers are jockeying to capitalize on the budding weight loss industry. And analysts say Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro has the potential to overtake drugs from Novo Nordisk after its approved in the U.S. for weight loss.  More than two in five adults have obesity, according to the National Institutes of Health. About 1 in 11 adults have severe obesity.",CNBC
John Rosevear,UAW strikes threaten already vulnerable auto parts suppliers,"In this article As the United Auto Workers’ strike against Ford Motor , General Motors and Stellantis moves through its second week, the economic effects are beginning to ripple through the U.S. automakers’ vast supply base. While the automakers and their larger Tier 1 suppliers likely have the resources to weather an extended work stoppage, there’s a network of smaller suppliers that could be hit hard by a prolonged strike — or even go out of business entirely. That network includes about 5,600 companies — most in the upper Midwest — that provide seats, suspension components, wiring harnesses and thousands of other parts used in brand-name vehicles. It’s substantial, employing an estimated 871,000 workers, according to the American Automotive Policy Council. Those smaller suppliers have only recently recovered from the shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting global shortage of semiconductors. Now, they’re coming under pressure to increase their own workers’ wages — in an environment where higher interest rates have made it more costly to borrow money — and staring down the threat of ongoing auto workers’ strikes. “We represent a lot of suppliers that are very, very concerned about where this is going,” said Dennis Devaney, a Detroit attorney who has represented both GM and Ford and who once served as a board member for the National Labor Relations Board. Devaney noted that some suppliers are still struggling with supplies of semiconductors and other components, in part because their Chinese counterparts are still recovering from Covid-related shutdowns and other logistical issues since the global health crisis. “The last thing they need from an economic perspective is a strike by the UAW,” he said. Some of the small suppliers may only be able to hold out a few weeks if the automaker factories they support are struck. Harbour Results, a manufacturing advisory firm near Detroit, estimates that about 30% of those smaller suppliers were in poor financial shape — or “unbankable” in Harbour’s view — as of the end of 2022, with another 21% characterized as struggling.   The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, or MEMA, a trade group that represents auto suppliers, has asked the White House for aid, writing in a Monday letter to President Joe Biden that it was particularly concerned about smaller suppliers with annual revenues of less than $200 million. “These suppliers are in every state throughout the U.S. and are often the largest employer in a county or region,” MEMA wrote. “In a recent industry survey, half of these suppliers were identified as financially distressed.” MEMA asked President Biden to use existing authority to direct the Small Business Administration to provide low-interest loans to suppliers to help them meet payroll so they can restart quickly once the strike is resolved. “Note that it only takes one component that is unavailable from a supplier to shut down an entire production line,” the association wrote. “We urge you to act now to support the vehicle supplier community.” In the face of prolonged strikes, some smaller suppliers are already cutting workers or announcing plans to do so. But layoffs could expose suppliers to another risk: In a still-tight labor market, those laid-off employees might be able to find other jobs quickly, meaning they might not be available to come back once the UAW’s strikes are resolved. LM Manufacturing, which makes seats for vehicles including the Ford Bronco, temporarily laid off about 650 workers last week in response to the UAW’s strike at the Detroit-area Ford plant that builds the Bronco. The Detroit-based company is a joint venture between privately held LAN Manufacturing and Canadian auto supplier Magna International , a Tier 1 heavyweight. As of Tuesday, two additional Detroit-area auto suppliers had already filed notices of potential layoffs with the state of Michigan. Parts maker CIE Newcor, a subsidiary of Spain’s CIE Automotive, filed a notice with the state of Michigan on Sep. 14 saying that it will lay off nearly 300 workers early next month if the strike continues. Privately held Eagle Industries, a maker of molded foam products for autos, said on Sep. 21 that it may soon need to lay off an estimated 171 of its 230 employees “due to evolving business circumstances.” “For every GM job, there’s six others in the economy that depend on us running,” GM CEO Mary Barra told CNBC. “We’ve got to get back to work.” Larger publicly traded suppliers such as Lear Corporation , Dana, Magna International and Adient aren’t expected to come out of the UAW’s strike unscathed. However, they haven’t experienced widespread effects just yet.    Barclays previously identified Dana as one of the most affected suppliers from the first round of UAW strikes that halted production at one assembly plant each for the Detroit automakers, beginning Sept. 15. The Ohio-based company — a supplier of axles, driveshafts, transmissions and other parts — makes components for several vehicles affected by the strikes. Dana, which did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment, has reportedly announced temporary layoffs of hundreds of Ohio workers due to striking UAW members at Jeep and Ford plants. If the UAW’s strike drags on and expands further past its current three assembly plants and 38 parts and distribution centers, Wall Street analysts believe that’s when larger publicly traded suppliers will really start to feel the strain. Some analysts also warn that automakers may put additional pressure on suppliers to lower costs in an effort to offset expected multibillion-dollar increases in any tentative agreements reached by GM, Ford and Stellantis, also known as original equipment suppliers, or OEMs. “This creates another tension point in the debate in OEM-supplier commercial discussions,” Barclays analyst Dan Levy told CNBC. “There’s some suppliers that probably legitimately can push back but there’s also probably some suppliers where it does create a little more complexity.” Historically, automakers have raised prices on new vehicles to offset higher labor costs and protect margins, but inflation as well as higher commodity costs have already pushed vehicle prices up, leaving little room for upward movement. Barclays expects the new UAW contracts to add between $2 billion and $3 billion of incremental costs annually to the automakers’ balance sheets. Spokespeople with Lear, Magna and Adient did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.",CNBC
Laya Neelakandan,Shoppers face higher orange juice prices as futures hit another record,"Orange juice is the latest item to succumb to higher prices at the grocery store, with futures on the commodity good reaching an all-time high this week. Future prices for the breakfast staple have been steadily climbing over the past few months, hitting a record high of $3.69 per pound Tuesday morning. That number is up 13% month to date and almost 78% year to date. With the price hike, the juice joins other major grocery store items facing high prices even as inflation slows, including raw sugar and cocoa. The drink’s price has shot up due to hurricanes and bad weather that slammed Florida — the main producer of orange juice for the U.S. — last year, which reduced the crop to its lowest level in nearly 80 years. A late freeze at the end of last year also devastated the crops. In July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it expected Florida to produce just around 15.9 million boxes of oranges this year, down 70% from the 2020-21 season. Other exporters such as Brazil and Mexico also lowered their estimated yields for the year, citing crop difficulties from warmer weather.",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,"Hollywood writers strike to end on Wednesday as WGA, AMPTP finalize labor deal","In this article Hollywood writers and studios have finalized the language of a tentative contract that will lead to the end to a nearly 150-day labor strike. Union leaders “voted unanimously to lift the restraining order and end the strike as of 12:01 am PT/3:01 am ET on Wednesday, September 27th,” the WGA said in a statement. Talks between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which includes top studios like Disney, Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery, resumed after months of starts and stops, ultimately leading to a preliminary deal. The deal will last until May 2026 and includes a 5% minimum pay increase upon the ratification of the contract. Another 4% bump will occur on May 2, 2024, and another 3.5% increase will be instituted on May 5, 2025. Writers were able to gain significant protections against the use of artificial intelligence. Namely, AI cannot write or rewrite literary material and AI-generated material will not be considered source material. When it comes to streaming, the guild negotiated a new residual based on viewership. High budget subscription video on demand series and films that are viewed by 20% or more of the service’s domestic subscribers in the first 90 days of release get a bonus equal to 50% of the fixed domestic and foreign residual. Views are calculated by hours streamed domestically of the season or film divided by the runtime. This new structure will go into effect on Jan. 1 and means writers would receive a bonus of $9,031 for a half-hour episode, $16,415 for a one-hour episode, or $40,500 for a streaming feature with a budget of over $30 million budget. Streamers will also provide the guild the total number of hours streamed both domestically and internationally for self-produced high budget streaming programs like Netflix’s original series. Across the board, scribes will see an increased contribution rate to their health and pensions as well as increased contributions for writing teams. The agreement also improved screenwriter compensation, writers’ room minimums and renewed a $250,000 showrunner training program, among other items. The negotiating committee recommended the agreement and sent it to the Writers Guild of America West Board and the Writers Guild of America East Council for approval. Both the board and council voted to authorize a contract ratification vote by membership. WGA members will have until Oct. 9 to cast their votes on the contract, the union said. Once negotiations are wrapped up with writers, the AMPTP will need to pivot to negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The acting guild’s members have been on strike since mid-July and are seeking contract updates similar to those requested by the writers. The WGA contract could act as a template for SAG-AFTRA to draft its own deal with Hollywood studios. Similar to writers, actors are looking to improve wages, working conditions, and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV. SAG-AFTRA has also looked to standardize the self-tape process, which became popular during the pandemic. Previously, actors would have an even playing field with in-person camera tests, but in recent years, actors have seen inequity in auditioning between those who can afford quality camera and lighting equipment and those who can’t. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is a member of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.",CNBC
Diana Olick,Mortgage demand shrinks as interest rates hit highest level in nearly 23 years,"Mortgage interest rates just hit a level not seen since the year 2000. As a result, mortgage demand is now sitting near a 27-year low. Total mortgage application volume fell 1.3% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume was 25.5% lower than the same week one year ago. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.41%, from 7.31%, with points decreasing to 0.71 from 0.72 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. The rate was 6.52% one year ago. The 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage rate increased to 7.34%, the highest rate in the history of the MBA’s jumbo rate series dating back to 2011. “Based on the FOMC’s most recent projections, rates are expected to be higher for longer, which drove the increase in Treasury yields,” said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, referencing the Federal Open Market Committee. “Overall applications declined, as both prospective homebuyers and homeowners continue to feel the impact of these elevated rates.” Applications to refinance a home loan fell 1% for the week and were 21% lower than they were one year ago. After record low interest rates throughout the first few years of the pandemic, and a refinance boom, there are precious few borrowers now with mortgage rates high enough to benefit from a refinance. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 2% for the week and were 27% lower than the same week year over year. Today’s potential buyers are facing an unprecedented dynamic of a historically low supply of homes for sale, coupled with both rising interest rates and rising prices. Higher interest rates historically throw cold water on home prices, but the supply and demand imbalance is so severe that it is pushing prices higher even though more and more buyers are unable to afford a home. Interest rates continued to move higher this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. Even sales of newly built homes, which had been rising due to the short supply on the resale market, took a hit in August, according to another report this week. Sales dropped nearly 9% in August from July’s pace, hitting the lowest level since March.",CNBC
Melissa Repko,"Target says it will close nine stores in major cities, citing violence, theft","In this article Target said Tuesday that it will close nine stores in major cities across the country, citing violence, theft and organized retail crime. The company will close one store in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood, two locations in Seattle, three stores in the San Francisco-Oakland area and three more in Portland, Oregon. The discounter said it will shutter the stores for good on Oct. 21. “We cannot continue operating these stores because theft and organized retail crime are threatening the safety of our team and guests, and contributing to unsustainable business performance,” Target said in a news release. “We know that our stores serve an important role in their communities, but we can only be successful if the working and shopping environment is safe for all.”  Target, which has nearly 2,000 stores in the U.S., has been outspoken about organized retail crime at its stores. It has said theft has driven higher levels of shrink, an industry term used to describe losses from goods that were damaged, misplaced or stolen. With its announcement Tuesday, Target also stands apart in its decision to both shutter stores and to explicitly blame that decision on retail crime. When the company reported fiscal second-quarter earnings in mid-May, CEO Brian Cornell said organized retail crime had shot up at its stores. He added shrink overall is expected to reduce Target’s full-year profitability by more than $500 million compared to the year-ago period.  When asked if the company plans to close stores because of rising shrink, Cornell stressed Target’s reluctance to shutter locations. “We do not want to close stores. We know how important our stores are. They create local jobs, they generate taxes, they’re very important for those local shoppers, and they play a critical role in communities across the country,” Cornell said on a call with reporters in May. “We’ll continue to do everything in our power to keep our doors open,” he added. “At the same time, we’ll be closely monitoring the safety of our team and guests as well as the financial impact to our business as we determine the right path forward at Target.”  The retail executive’s comments led other companies to speak out on the problem, too, and to advocate for legislative reform. Following the passage of the Inform Act, which requires online marketplaces to disclose the identities of certain high-volume sellers to deter the sale of stolen and counterfeit goods, retailers and trade associations are now pushing for the passage of another bill called the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act.  The bill, which Target said it supports in Tuesday’s news release, proposes stiffer penalties for theft offenses and calls for a change in the threshold prosecutors must meet before bringing federal theft cases. It would also provide retailers with a formal venue to exchange information with one another and law enforcement through the proposed Organized Retail Crime Coordination Center. Since 2022, at least nine states — six so far this year — have passed similar laws to impose harsher penalties for organized retail crime offenses. Behind the sweep of legislation are retailers and trade associations, which are using their collective power to get the bills written and past the finish line. Store closures, or the threat of them, have been a major factor in retailers convincing lawmakers to get on board, policy experts previously told CNBC.  Target’s business has struggled for more than a year with company-specific challenges, including a glut of unsold inventory, backlash to its Pride merchandise collection and a pullback in consumer spending on discretionary items such as apparel and home goods. Over the past two decades, Target had not mentioned shrink hitting its margins during earnings calls until August 2022, when the company’s and other retailers’ profits were getting hurt by higher markdowns while trying to unload unwanted merchandise, CNBC previously reported. When inventories rise, shrink tends to increase as well, industry experts told CNBC. The company previously said its shrink numbers vary widely by location and do not correlate with inventory levels. Target said Tuesday that it has taken a variety of steps to stop crime at its stores. Those measures include adding locked cases for some merchandise, hiring third-party guard services, training store leaders about how to de-escalate potentially dangerous situations and investing in cyber defense to stop fraud or organized crime. Yet, Target said at the affected stores, a larger security team and theft-deterrent tools weren’t enough. “Despite our efforts, unfortunately, we continue to face fundamental challenges to operating these stores safely and successfully,” Target said in the release. The company said it will work with employees at the closed stores to give them an opportunity to transfer to another Target location.  It’s not clear what actions the company is taking to improve inventory management.  Target announced the store closures on the same day the National Retail Federation, the industry’s major trade association, released its latest National Retail Security Survey. The survey found the effect of theft on retailers’ bottom lines is about the same as it has been for years. Total retail shrink grew to more than $112 billion in 2022, up from $93.9 billion the year before, according to the survey. The metric is calculated using total U.S. retail sales and generally rises as retail sales climb.  When reported as a percentage of sales as is commonly done, average annual shrink increased to 1.57%, up from 1.44% in 2021. The share is largely in line with past years and is considered a normal and healthy level of shrink by industry experts. Generally, retailers plan for about 1% to 2% of shrink each year.  Target joins a growing list of retailers that have shuttered stores in major cities, including Walmart , Nordstrom and Walgreens Boots Alliance . Nordstrom closed its San Francisco flagship store and Nordstrom Rack location in the city this summer after operating there for more than 35 years. Yet, the company cited market dynamics rather than crime. In a message to employees at the time, then-Chief Stores Officer Jamie Nordstrom said changes in downtown San Francisco had hurt “customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully.” A brazen smash and grab in August at one of Nordstrom’s other locations, a store in Los Angeles, made national headlines. On an earnings call in late August, the company was asked about the widely circulated video of the crime. CEO Erik Nordstrom described the incident as “disturbing to all of us,” and said losses from theft are “at historical highs.” But, he added, theft is included in company guidance and not higher than expected. In a December interview with CNBC, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warned that stores will close if shoplifters aren’t aggressively prosecuted. Walmart has also closed some stores, including four in Chicago in April, but didn’t blame theft. In a news release at the time, the retailer said it has struggled to make the locations profitable and challenges have intensified. It said the stores “lose tens of millions of dollars a year, and their annual losses nearly doubled in just the last five years.” Walgreens, similar to Target, specifically pointed to organized retail crime as the reason for shuttering some stores in San Francisco in 2021.",CNBC
Brandon Gomez,"U.S. Latino economic output grows to $3.2 trillion, according to new study","The U.S. Latino economy continues to grow, reaching $3.2 trillion in 2021, up from $2.8 trillion the year prior, according to a new report by the Latino Donor Collaborative in partnership with Wells Fargo. Over the last decade, the U.S. Latino economy has grown two and a half times faster than the non-Latino equivalent, surpassing the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom, India, France and Italy, according to the report released Wednesday by LDC, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group focused on reshaping perceptions of U.S. Latinos through data and economic research. If Latinos were an independent country, their GDP would rank fifth in the world, the study found. “We have a massive economy that’s under-invested right now, under-engaged,” said Sol Trujillo, Latino Donor Collaborative chairman, in an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Lea este artículo en español aquí. Industry strength for Latinos remains steady in accommodation and food services, construction, administrative support, waste management and transportation. While growth for the Latino community remains widespread in the U.S. geographically, the community drove particular growth in the states of California, Texas and Florida, amounting to $682 billion, $465 billion and $240 billion of economic impact, respectively. That is largely due to the Latino community’s strong population share, labor force participation and overall productivity in those states. “I would say if you look at the charts now that we have in our study, 48 out of the 50 states’ growth is tied to this [Latino] cohort,” Trujillo said. The California Latino economy alone would rank as the 21st largest economy in the world, between Poland and Switzerland, according to LDC’s analysis. In Latino emerging markets, South Dakota, North Dakota and New Hampshire have seen a surprising surge, with the highest GDP growth rates since 2011. In South Dakota, the economic impact of Latinos grew at an annual rate of 11.8% in 2021, according to LDC, slightly outpacing its neighbor. “Businesses operating in these areas must stay ahead of these substantial changes to ensure they remain relevant,” LDC noted in the report. “And be able to meet the needs of their evolving customer base.” The report also found that Latinos’ wages and salary incomes — totaling $1.67 trillion in 2021 — grew more than those of non-Latinos over the previous decade at an annualized rate of 4.7% compared to 1.9% for non-Latinos. But despite the rapid growth, a substantial wage gap persists in the country, with the average Latino worker earning 80 cents for every $1 earned by white non-Hispanic employees. Latinos’ purchasing power in the U.S. was strong and reached $3.4 trillion in 2021. Collective purchasing power of U.S. Latinos grew between 2.1 and 2.4 times faster than non-Latino counterparts, according to the report. “In the rest of this century, this cohort is only going to get bigger and bigger,” said Trujillo. “So those who want to get in early, think about it. Think about capital and fund structures that could flow.” The findings were released alongside the L’Attitude conference examining the state of Latino leadership, participation and representation in corporate America, as well as in the public, media and entertainment sectors. The report is based on data from 2021, the most recent year for which information is publicly available. It includes data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among others.",CNBC
Melissa Repko,"Costco tops quarterly earnings expectations, even as sales remain soft","In this article Costco on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street’s expectations, as shoppers turned to the membership club for groceries but bought fewer big-ticket items. On an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said shoppers made more trips to the retailer’s stores, even as they spent less. He said sales of pricier items in the U.S., outside of food, were weaker and falling gas prices also weighed on revenue. Traffic rose 5.2% worldwide and 5% in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis. Costco’s average transaction amount in the quarter dropped nearly 4% worldwide and 4.5% in the U.S., he said. Here’s what the membership-based warehouse club reported for the three-month period that ended Sept. 3 compared with what analyst were expecting, according to consensus estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Costco’s net income for the fiscal fourth quarter rose to $2.2 billion, or $4.86 per share, compared with $1.87 billion, or $4.20 per share, a year earlier. Comparable sales for the company rose 1.1% year over year but only 0.2% in the U.S. Excluding changes in gas prices, the metric rose 3.8% overall and 3.1% in the U.S. Costco has gained momentum in the past three years, as membership-based warehouse clubs benefited from dynamics such as more Americans cooking from home and more millennials moving into suburban homes with bigger pantries during the pandemic. Inflation has also driven some shoppers to sign up and renew their memberships to clubs, including Walmart -owned Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club . Those favorable membership trends continued in the quarter. Costco ended the period with 71 million paid household members, up nearly 8% from a year ago. That growth outpaced its rate of new store openings, which grew by slightly under 3%. Costco has also gotten more of those members to spring for its pricier membership. The higher-tier, called Executive Membership, costs $120 on an annual basis compared to $60 for the typical annual membership, and includes some additional perks. As of the end quarter, Costco had 32.3 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 981,000 since the end of the prior quarter. Those higher-tier members now account for slightly over 45% of all paid membership, Galanti said. They also account for about 73% of its global sales, he said. In recent quarters, even Costco has spoken about consumers pulling back on some big-ticket and discretionary items, as grocery bills and housing costs remain elevated. That trend has weighed in particular on Costco’s digital sales. E-commerce sales declined 0.8% compared with the year-ago period. On the earnings call, Galanti said customers are buying less of the items that tend to make up a bigger part of the company’s online sales, such as furniture, small electronics and jewelry. But some discretionary items have popped on the company’s website, Galanti said. Sales of appliances rose more than 30% year over year in the quarter. And, he added, the company has had trouble keeping a new offering in stock: one ounce gold bars. “When we load them on the site, they’re typically gone within a few hours and we limit two per member,” Galanti said. Costco echoed a trend seen at rival retailers, including Walmart and Target : Groceries are the category driving sales. Costco has also tried new approaches to get customers to toss more items in the basket when they’re shopping aisles outside of the grocery department, Galanti said. The retailer has added small-ticket items, such as cheaper, impulse-driven snacks. It has kept merchandise fresh by carrying popular gaming systems and by the early debut of Christmas items. So far, trees, toys and decor have sold well, Galanti said. In the U.S., Costco’s biggest market, sales trends have slowed. The majority of Costco’s clubs — nearly 600 of the company’s 861 warehouses — are in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. In the year-ago fiscal fourth quarter, comparable sales rose 15.8% in the U.S., but since then they have largely decelerated. In the past two quarters, comparable sales — an industry metric that takes out the effect of store openings and closures — were roughly flat in the U.S. from the prior-year periods. Investors have been anticipating a membership fee hike for Costco that hasn’t occurred. Its last bump came in June 2017, and based on its typical practice, the retailer was due to increase it in early 2023. Those fees drive the bulk of Costco’s revenue. On the earnings call, an analyst asked if a fee increase is part of the retailer’s fiscal plan. Galanti said a hike in the amount that members pay is “a question of when, not if.” But he declined to specify when that may be. In addition, Costco plans to open 10 new stores in the next three months, including nine in the U.S. and one in Canada, Galanti said. He said it finished the fiscal year with 23 net new locations, including stores in China, Japan and Australia.  Shares of Costco have climbed about 21% so far this year, outperforming the 11% gains of the S&P 500. The company’s stock closed on Tuesday at $552.96, down about 1%.",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Fast fashion is leaning into resale, but a new study finds it may not work","Fast-fashion retailers like Zara, Shein and H&M are using resale platforms to reduce their carbon footprints, but the programs are projected to do little to reduce emissions, a new study released Tuesday found.  The brands could more effectively reduce their toll on the environment if they redirected those efforts to their supply chain, such as by using more sustainable materials or investing in recycling innovations, according to the analysis. The study was conducted by Trove, which helps brands like Lululemon and Canada Goose implement resale programs, and Worldly, a data analytics firm that focuses on ESG, or environmental, social and corporate governance. The study’s methodology was validated with third parties and reviewed by Deloitte, McKinsey and University of California, Berkeley, among others, Trove’s founder and one of the study’s authors Andy Ruben told CNBC. The study analyzed five brand archetypes, spanning fast fashion to premium apparel, and how reselling previously owned items could affect their overall carbon emissions between 2023 and 2040. It found that fast-fashion retailers, which create about 11.5 kilograms (25.3 pounds) of carbon dioxide for every item they make, will only reduce their emissions by 0.7% with resale programs. In comparison, premium apparel brands like Tory Burch and Ralph Lauren create about 16 kilograms of CO2 for every item they make, and could reduce those emissions by 14.8% with resale programs, the analysis said. Outdoor brands, like Patagonia and the North Face, create about 12.5 kilograms of CO2 per item and could reduce emissions by 15.8%, according to the study.  The projections factor in lower production of new items, which would help to cut emissions. Companies could offset decreased sales of new products with revenue gained from reselling a previously owned item.  The findings come as a slew of companies – from apparel retailers like Gap to home goods companies like The Container Store – implement resale programs to capture customers who care about sustainability, or might just be looking for a deal. The initiatives allow companies to make money off of items they’ve already sold and show investors and consumers they’re focused on sustainability, especially as they prepare for new ESG reporting requirements from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Ruben said it takes a lot of work for fast-fashion retailers to implement resale programs, but “you’re not getting a lot of juice for the squeeze.”  “It really comes down to how many people want your items after you’ve sold them the first time,” Ruben said in an interview with CNBC. “So if you sold an original T-shirt for $8, and you resell it for 20 cents, you’re not offsetting much revenue and you’re doing a lot of activity that adds to the carbon footprint to move it back around.” Fast-fashion retailers have faced broad criticism for the negative impacts they can have on the environment. Some of the largest players in the space – H&M, Zara and Shein – have started resale programs in a bid to be more sustainable.  Earlier this year, H&M announced it was partnering with ThredUp to debut a resale program that allows customers to shop for pre-owned items. Zara and Shein both announced peer-to-peer resale platforms last fall.  The programs, which some criticized as insufficient, help the environment in the sense that it’s more sustainable to buy a used item than it is to buy a new product. However, the programs can be difficult for fast-fashion retailers to scale profitably, which could limit investments in the efforts. Further, the study indicates resale platforms aren’t enough to meaningfully increase sustainability at fast-fashion companies. “It’s misplaced effort,” said Ruben. “What they’re basically doing is moving around items that hold none of their value, which is a marketing program.” Both Zara and H&M are working to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 and have disclosed some of the progress they’ve made in reducing their water consumption and using more sustainable materials, among other initiatives.  In a statement, an H&M spokesperson said the company agrees with Trove’s report, which is why it’s “working with different levers” to reduce its impact on global carbon emissions. “We are working towards decarbonizing our supply chain and logistics operations by strengthening the availability and usage of renewable energy and funding the innovation and distribution of technology needed,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said the company is increasing its use of recycled and more sustainably sourced materials, and aims to increase its use of recycled fibers to 30% by 2025. Zara didn’t return a request for comment from CNBC. Shein, for its part, often touts its inventory-light model as a crucial factor that reduces waste on the back end. The company has invested in strategies that reduce water use throughout its production process and launched its “evoluSHEIN” product line, which features garments made with recycled polyester, forest-safe viscose and other materials that are more eco-friendly. “We continue to scale SHEIN’s on-demand business model, which allows us to achieve average unsold inventory rates in the low single digits, dramatically reducing waste, and invest in building circular systems and accelerating sustainable solutions through sustainably focused materials, technologies and production processes,” a Shein spokesperson told CNBC. “As a fashion leader, we acknowledge our role in creating a more sustainable and responsible fashion industry, and SHEIN Exchange is just one step we are taking as part of our larger commitment to prioritizing waste reduction and circularity,” the spokesperson said. To reduce their impact on the environment, fast-fashion retailers are better off redirecting their resale investments into recycling innovations and sustainable materials, among other practices that can reduce emissions, said Gayle Tait, Trove’s CEO.  “What the research is underpinning is that brands have to demonstrate meaningful investment into shifting their model,” said Tait. “When they’re kind of skirting around the edges, by doing either a branded peer-to-peer site or working closely with a marketplace, they’re not actually shifting their model. They’re continuing to do the things that got their carbon emissions.”",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,Peloton co-founder and Chief Product Officer Tom Cortese is leaving the company,"In this article Peloton co-founder and Chief Product Officer Tom Cortese is leaving the company and will be replaced by longtime Silicon Valley veteran Nick Caldwell, the company announced Tuesday.  Cortese, who helped found the connected fitness company alongside former CEO John Foley in 2012, will move into an advisory role beginning Nov. 1, the company said.  “After nearly 12 years of pouring myself into Peloton and serving our Members, I have decided it is time to move on and create space for new perspectives,” Cortese said in a news release. “I’m eager for new growth for Peloton and for me personally, but I’m also excited to support and watch this next phase of Peloton’s evolution. I could not be more proud of what we have accomplished, together.” Caldwell most recently served on the board of tech companies Bitly, HubSpot and True Search and previously did stints at Twitter, Google, Reddit and Microsoft, where he worked for nearly 16 years at the start of his career, according to his LinkedIn profile.  He’ll oversee global product development and will start the new role Nov. 1.  “I want to thank Tom for his tireless dedication since launching Peloton nearly 12 years ago as a Co-Founder of the business. We simply wouldn’t be here today without his contributions,” CEO Barry McCarthy said in a statement. “Nick brings impressive engineering, design, and product experience to the Peloton team. Nick joins us at an exciting time as we lean into growing our subscriber base online and on our connected fitness hardware.” The news comes more than a year into McCarthy’s stint as Peloton’s CEO. Since he took over, he has tapped Leslie Berland as the company’s marketing chief and Dalana Brand as its chief people officer, among other hires. Both Berland and Brand were executives at Twitter before joining Peloton.  With Cortese’s departure, just two executives from Peloton’s early days remain in its C-suite. Jennifer Cotter, the company’s chief content officer, and Dion Camp Sanders, its chief emerging business officer, have both been with the company since Foley was at the helm.  During an interview with CNBC earlier this year, Cortese recalled Peloton’s early days and what inspired him and Foley to start the business. ″[In] 2013, so 10 years ago now, I was standing in the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey, my kids thinking that I was a mall retail guy, and we were selling people on the idea of being able to access energetic, remarkable fitness from the most convenient place on Earth: their home,” Cortese told CNBC. “The reason we were doing that is because what we saw happening in the real world … brick and mortar, was that people were turning to boutique studio fitness as something that was starting to excite them, right? So just going to the gym wasn’t quite doing it … hence the Peloton Bike, and all that goes with it, was born.” Cortese started as the company’s chief operating officer and took over as product chief in August 2021, according to his LinkedIn. Most recently, he was involved in the development of Peloton’s app and the introduction of new product features on its connected fitness products. Back in the company’s early days, Peloton was a product-first retailer that made the bulk of its revenue selling its pricey connected fitness products, including its Bike, Bike+ and Tread, as an alternative to the gym.  However, in the years since, Peloton’s products have undergone numerous recalls for a series of manufacturing flaws, some that left customers injured.  Its Tread+ treadmill was recalled after a child was killed. The company has since been mired in fines and legal battles related to its products and their recalls.  When Peloton last reported earnings Aug. 23, executives said they believe the most recent recall of its Bike seat post led to increased membership churn and was costing the company far more than it anticipated.  These days, subscription revenue is Peloton’s primary revenue driver. Earlier this year, it announced a massive brand overhaul that elevated Peloton’s subscription offerings and signaled the company is just as invested in its app as it is its hardware.  While the company frequently insists hardware is still one of its primary focus areas, new product development appears to have slowed. When asked earlier this year if the company had plans to introduce new hardware, Cortese hinted at more to come. “We maintain a strong hardware development team,” he said. “They are certainly not twiddling their thumbs.”",CNBC
Bertha Coombs,Working women spend $15.4 billion more than men in out-of-pocket health costs,"High health-care costs are hitting women in the U.S. workforce much harder than men. Working women spend $15.4 billion more in out-of-pocket health expenses annually compared to their male counterparts, according to a new analysis of employer-sponsored health plans from Deloitte Consulting. The study found women spend 18% more than men on copays and deductibles, on average. That’s after excluding costs associated with pregnancy and maternity, according to the new report, and despite total health expenditures for women that are just 10% higher than for men. “This is a problem we’re identifying that business leaders can actually solve within their own organizations. The takeaway being that women get paid less, and that they pay more for health care,” said Dr. Kulleni Gebreyes, U.S. chief health equity officer at Deloitte Consulting. The result, she said, is a disproportionate financial burden. Women tend to utilize more medical care than men, in part due to annual gynecological exams and the high costs of breast cancer imaging. While annual exams are often fully covered, follow-ups that can result from those visits incur copays and trigger deductibles. Many of those services are often more expensive than the typical deductible, leading to a higher cost-sharing burden.     Deloitte analysts say employers could close the $15.4 billion cost-sharing gender gap through enhanced benefits design, at an estimated cost of $133 per employee per year, or about $11 per month. “Our ask is that companies look at their data; examine if and where the gaps exist and step back to have more of an equitable design process to come up with what are the health benefits that would meet the needs of their workforce,” said Gebreyes.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,"UAW strike: Biden, Trump seek blue-collar votes in swing state Michigan","In this article DETROIT — Strikes by the United Auto Workers union against General Motors , Ford Motor and Stellantis will get the presidential treatment this week in Michigan. Twice, in fact. President Joe Biden visited a picket line Tuesday at a GM parts facility in Belleville following a public invitation Friday from UAW President Shawn Fain, who joined Biden for the visit. Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner among Republicans in the 2024 presidential race, is scheduled to hold a rally Wednesday night at an auto supplier in Clinton Township, Michigan. Biden and Trump are effectively tied in the polls over a year out from the election. Each 2024 presidential candidate is trying to win over blue-collar voters such as Darius Collier, one of about 18,300 autoworkers currently on strike, who says he’s “indifferent” about the candidates. “It would be good if they actually show the support that we need to get through this,” said Collier, whose Mopar facility in Centerline, Michigan, is one of 10 parts and distribution centers set for potential closure under a recent contract proposal by Stellantis to consolidate facilities. Michigan voters helped both Biden and Trump in winning the White House during the past two presidential elections, in 2020 and 2016, respectively. They’ve both gained union support, but in different ways. While the UAW has historically supported Democrats, including Biden in 2020, Fain is withholding the union’s reendorsement of the president, who has touted himself as the “most pro-union president in American history.” Trump has won support of many rank-and-file union members. “Both President Trump and President Biden understand the importance that Michigan has electorally and there’s a realization that elections can be very close, so they want to be seen frequently,” said Mark Burton, a partner at Honigman law firm and a former chief strategist of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. “The UAW strike is a wonderful, high-publicity moment to deploy their message and be seen once again.” Michigan Democrats such as Whitmer and U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell have attended UAW rallies since the UAW’s Sept. 15 strikes began. However, Fain’s politician of choice has been Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran against Biden in 2020. Fain has appeared with the independent senator from Vermont in Washington, D.C., and during a recent UAW rally in Detroit. He also has echoed Sanders’ messages of fighting “corporate greed” and has positioned the UAW’s collective bargaining with the Detroit automakers as a “war” between the billionaire and blue-collar classes. Fain invited Biden to join the UAW picket lines days after Trump announced he would skip the second GOP debate to hold a rally in Macomb County, Michigan, where a large contingent of blue-collar autoworkers live. “We invite and encourage everyone who supports our cause to join us on the picket line, from our friends and families all the way up to the president of the United States,” Fain said Friday during a Facebook Live stream. Fain has not expressed much support for Biden, many times saying he needs to better prove his claim of being the “most pro-union president.” However, Fain’s made clear his position on Trump. “Every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers,” Fain said last week in a statement. “We can’t keep electing billionaires and millionaires that don’t have any understanding what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to get by and expecting them to solve the problems of the working class.” The UAW on Tuesday issued a largely generic press release ahead of Biden’s visit, saying it will “mark the first time a sitting U.S. President has joined striking workers on a picket line,” followed by several paragraphs about the union’s strike and no statement from Fain. Fain, on the picket line with Biden at the Willow Run Redistribution Center, called the president joining the picket line a “historic moment.” But he did not officially endorse the commander-in-chief for next year’s presidential election. “Today, I just want to take a moment to stand with all of you with our president and say thank you to the president. Thank you, Mr. President, for coming,” Fain said Tuesday. “We know the president will do right by the working class. And when we do right by the working class, you can leave the rest to us because we’re going to take care of this business.” UAW is not affiliated with Trump’s Wednesday rally at Drake Enterprises, which is reportedly a non-union supplier of engine, transmission and other components for heavy truck, agriculture and automotive markets. But UAW members have previously attended and participated in Trump’s events in Michigan. Fain has previously said a second Trump term in the White House would be a “disaster.” However, Trump, as he has in the past, is gaining blue-collar support. “I like Trump,” said Niko Shinn, another autoworker who’s currently on strike at the Mopar plant. “He’s a good businessman and seems like he knows more about, not politics, but negotiating and stuff like that.” Trump’s support among union members has increased as Biden’s has fallen in recent months, according to Michigan polling company EPIC·MRA. Trump led Biden 46% to 43% among union members in an August survey, after Biden led Trump 51% to 42% in June, according to Bernie Porn, president of EPIC·MRA. “With union members, he has been so supportive of just about everything that union members want. The one thing that they’re concerned about is the push towards electric vehicles because they’re concerned about the fewer numbers of employees it takes to build an electric vehicle,” Porn said. Electric vehicles, or EVs, are expected to require less labor and parts than the traditional vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines. They are expected to be one of several talking points Trump discusses during his Wednesday rally. “President Trump’s rhetoric in his position stances, I think, stands clearly with the vast majority of the rank-and-file of the UAW who are concerned about their jobs being eliminated by this Biden administration forced transition to electric vehicles,” said Jamie Roe, a Republican strategist based in Macomb County, where Trump’s rally is being held. Fain has said the union is withholding a reelection endorsement for Biden until the union’s concerns about the auto industry’s transition to all-electric vehicles are addressed. Biden’s visit may be an olive branch to assist in the UAW’s eventual endorsement as well as potential leverage for the union in its ongoing negotiations with the Detroit automakers. “I think the president’s visit, particularly if Shawn Fain is joining [Biden] on a picket line, I think it is another stroke of strategy that increases the pressure and increases the overall strength of the union when it comes to the actual negotiations with the autos,” Burton said.",CNBC
Courtney Reagan,"Retail theft isn’t actually increasing much, major industry study finds","Retail theft has caught the attention of the masses in recent years, from startling smash-and-grab videos during the depths of the Covid pandemic to corporate earnings calls where retailers like Target and Foot Locker are discussing losses from organized retail crime more than they ever have. But the effect of theft on retailers’ bottom lines is about the same as it has been for years, according to the latest data released Tuesday in the widely used industry survey conducted by the National Retail Federation. Total retail shrink grew to more than $112 billion in 2022, up from $93.9 billion the year before, according to the newest National Retail Security Survey. The metric, which accounts for various types of inventory loss including theft, damage and vendor error, generally rises as retail sales climb. While retailers and the NRF are increasingly saying crime is cutting into profits, losses from internal and external theft last year were largely on par with historical trends. They made up 65% of total shrink, the survey found. External theft, which includes organized retail crime, was again reported as the largest source of shrink last year at 36.15%, but that was slightly below 37% in 2021. Internal theft, or goods stolen by employees, rose slightly to 28.85% from 28.5% in 2021. Process and control failures and errors made up 27.29% of shrink in 2022, up from 25.7% the year prior. External theft (including organized retail crime): 36.15% Internal/employee theft: 28.85% Process/control errors: 27.29% Unknown: 5.88% Other losses: 1.32% Source: NRF National Retail Security Survey Retail shrink climbed in absolute dollars, but when reported as a percentage of sales as is commonly done, average annual shrink increased to 1.57%, up from 1.44% in 2021. The share is largely in line with past years. Average annual shrink was 1.62% of sales before the pandemic in 2019, though it was as low as 1.33% in 2017, according to previous surveys. The NRF conducted the online survey of senior loss prevention and security executives in the retail industry. The results for 2022 include 177 retail brand respondents, which the organization said accounted for 22% of retail sales in 2022. The NRF report said 78% of the retailers that responded to the survey do not include e-commerce goods in their shrink calculation and 57% don’t include supply chain losses, so “the actual dollar loss associated with shrink (and with theft in particular) is likely heavily underreported.” It’s not necessarily the amount of theft taking place that most concerns the industry, but rather the increased violence associated with it. “Far beyond the financial impact of these crimes, the violence and concerns over safety continue to be the priority for all retailers, regardless of size or category,” David Johnston, vice president for asset protection and retail operations at the NRF, said in a press release. Sixty-seven percent of respondents reported more violence associated with organized retail crime than a year ago. In the last survey, 81% reported an increase in violence. Meanwhile, 45% of retailers in the survey said they have reduced specific store hours to deal with crime and violence, nearly 30% said they somehow changed store product selection, and 28% reported closing a specific location because of crime. Companies identified Los Angeles, San Francisco/Oakland, Houston, New York and Seattle as the five cities and metropolitan areas most affected by retail crime. Unsurprisingly, nearly all respondents, 93%, support some type of federal organized retail crime legislation. Congress passed one law, called the Inform Act, that aims to deter the sale of stolen goods online, and lawmakers have introduced another that calls for stiffer penalties for theft offenses. The NRF supports the bill and previously told CNBC it helped to write it. Internal, or employee theft, also concerns retailers because “an employee who decides to steal or collude with outsiders to steal often does so at a higher loss per incident than external thieves.” Some companies have identified goods stolen by workers as a major issue and taken steps to address it, even as the industry focuses more on external theft in public, CNBC previously reported. The NRF study said the average dollar loss reported for an internal theft was $2,180 per investigation in 2022, in line with 2021 and 2020 levels. The average dollar loss for external shoplifting incidents, for comparison, was $1,063 per incident. It’s not only high-value products that are being stolen, but also consumable items that are easy to resell and often difficult to track. So while luxury items often get the “smash and grab” attention, energy drinks, beauty products, candles and detergent are also among the products thieves target.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,"Diller rips WGA deal, says fair use needs to be redefined to address AI","Slamming the tentative labor deal between Hollywood writers and studios, media mogul Barry Diller on Tuesday laid out his biggest bone of contention with generative artificial intelligence. Diller, chair of IAC and Expedia, called for the law to be redefined to protect published material from capture in the knowledge bases of artificial intelligence. “Fair use needs to redefined, because what they have done is sucked up everything and that violates the basis of the copyright law,” Diller said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “All we want to do is establish that there is no such thing as fair use for AI, which gives us standing.” Diller’s complaints came as prominent authors, including George R.R. Martin and Jodi Picoult, have sued OpenAI for copyright infringement. His remarks also followed on the heels of the Writers Guild of America’s tentative agreement with Hollywood studios to end a nearly 150-day strike. Diller isn’t a fan of the deal. “They spent months trying to craft words to protect writers from AI and they ended up with a paragraph that protected nothing from no one,” Diller said. The details of the tentative deal between the WGA and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have not been made public. Hollywood studios are expected to walk away with the right to use and train AI models using writers’ work, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the negotiations. On the other hand, writers are expected to be guaranteed compensation for work they do on scripts, even if the studios employ an AI tool, the Journal report added. Legacy media and AI companies, most notably ChatGPT creator OpenAI, have clashed on what content should be allowed into the knowledge base of generative artificial intelligence. Critics of AI point to the fair use doctrine under U.S. copyright law, which permits limited portions of a work to be used without a license or compensation. Generative AI and language-based model systems index entire bodies of work within their knowledge base, a violation of fair use, some argue. According to Diller, that’s one of his key points of contention with Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. “The thing that Sam and I disagree and have talked about is that he believes fair use allows him to take all of a publisher’s [work],” said Diller. “We believe that it doesn’t.” Altman, who also served on the Expedia board with Diller, testified before senators in May to discuss regulations on AI. “We think that creators deserve control over how their creations are used, and what happens sort of beyond the point of them releasing it into the world,” Altman said during the hearing. “We need to figure out new ways with this new technology that creators can win, succeed and have a vibrant life, and I’m optimistic that this will present it.” CNBC has reached out to OpenAI for a response to Diller’s remarks. Shutterstock, a stock media service and OpenAI partner since 2021, set up a contributors fund for creators which provides compensation if their intellectual property is used during AI content generation. Altman also said that Shutterstock was critical in the training of OpenAI’s generative media AI, DALL-E.",CNBC
Diana Olick,"Sales of newly built homes reverse course, drop nearly 9% in August","Sales of newly built homes fell 8.7% in August from July to a seasonally adjusted annualized pace of 675,000 units, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That is the slowest pace since March. Sales were still 5.8% higher than August 2022. The Census count is based on signed contracts during the month, and mortgage rates took a sharp jump higher. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan ended July at 7.04%, according to Mortgage News Daily. By Aug. 22, it was at 7.48%. “Very stretched affordability means demand will be unable to recover in the near term, causing new home sales to fall back from 675,000 annualized in August to 600,000 annualized by the end of the year,” wrote Imogen Pattison, assistant economist at Capital Economics. The median price of a newly built home sold in August was $430,300, a drop of 2% compared to August of last year. Homebuilders have been lowering prices as well as offering more incentives, such as buying down mortgage rates. They had slowed those incentives last spring, when rates went below 7%, but they are ramping them up again. One of the nation’s largest homebuilders, Lennar, recently reported strong earnings, but that was for a quarter where mortgage rates hadn’t hit their highest yet. Lennar Chairman Stuart Miller, however, noted buyer incentives in the release. “Homebuilders continued to use incentives, including buy-downs, to offset rising interest rates and tighter capital, which limit affordability,” said Miller. Homebuilders continue to benefit from the extremely tight supply of existing homes for sale, but that boost may finally be overcome by higher interest rates. Builder sentiment dropped into negative territory in September for the first time in seven months, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ monthly survey. In September, 32% of builders said they cut prices, compared to 25% in August. That’s the largest share of builders reducing prices since December 2022, when 35% were doing so. The average price cut was 6%. “High mortgage rates are clearly taking a toll on builder confidence and consumer demand, as a growing number of buyers are electing to defer a home purchase until long-term rates move lower,” Robert Dietz, NAHB’s chief economist, said in a release.",CNBC
Melina Khan,"UPS to hire 100,000 holiday workers with Teamsters pay bump","In this article UPS plans to hire more than 100,000 seasonal workers again this year to support the holiday shipping rush, the company announced Tuesday in a press release. This year, though, they’ll be starting with a higher pay. As a result of a contract agreement with the Teamsters union that was ratified in August, seasonal workers’ pay will start between $21 and $23 per hour, depending on the position.  The Teamsters deal with UPS comes as workers from pilots to aerospace manufacturing employees have pushed for and won higher pay. Package handlers and driver helpers will make $21 per hour, while delivery and tractor-trailer drivers will make $23 per hour during the holiday season, a UPS spokesperson said. Last year, package handlers’ starting pay was $15.50 per hour and delivery drivers made a minimum of $21 per hour. The company said it is hiring both full- and part-time positions, primarily drivers and package handlers. Some permanent positions are also available.  “We’re proud to offer industry-leading pay for UPS part-timers, full-timers and seasonal employees alike,” Nando Cesarone, UPS’ executive vice president, said in the release. “We’re looking forward to delivering yet another leading on-time performance this holiday season and helping thousands of workers kick off their UPS careers in the process.” Nearly 80% of the company’s seasonal positions do not require an interview, UPS said in the release. The carrier hired the same number of seasonal workers in 2022.",CNBC
Lillian Rizzo,"Professional Pickleball, Tennis Channel deepen media partnership","Professional Pickleball is getting a dedicated home: The Tennis Channel. The PPA Tour and Tennis Channel announced on Tuesday they are teaming up via a joint venture in a push to further grow and popularize the sport that has been picking up steam in the U.S. As part of the partnership, Tennis Channel will produce all PPA Tour events and have the rights to broadcast a vast majority of them on its pay-TV network and streaming platforms. “It’s going to create so much more access for people,” PPA Tour owner Tom Dundon told CNBC. “I think this makes it way easier to bring to the masses.” The pair will also create pickleballtv, a 24/7 standalone free, ad-supported streaming channel featuring matches as well as entertainment surrounding the sport. For the PPA Tour, the joint venture will allow Tennis Channel to take the reigns on producing all of its content both for its own platforms as well as the Tour’s other media partners, including Disney ’s ESPN, Paramount ’s CBS and Prime Video. “A lot of emerging sports sometimes have trouble with production, quality and consistency,” said Dundon. “So when we deliver a program to Fox or ESPN, they know it’s perfect. It makes it a lot easier for them to want to carry us and cover us.” While terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, the agreement allows Tennis Channel owner Sinclair to retain the option of an equity stake in Pickleball.com, the parent company of the PPA Tour. Dundon added it’s a 50-50 partnership between the two entities, noting the PPA Tour will put the capital in and Tennis Channel will bring its production and media expertise. Read more: Pickleball is loud. The people behind it say they’re trying to fix it. “If you look at what Apple did with [Major League Soccer], the MLS does all of the production. So I think we’re just consistent with where the [media] world’s going where we can produce it cheaper, with scale,” Dundon said. He foresees the joint venture propelling further media rights deals with the help of Tennis Channel executives that are familiar with TV carriage negotiations and building up streaming platforms. “This partnership is really the seminal moment for what is still in many ways the nation’s sport...And we get to take 20 years of right decisions and mistakes and apply them directly to expand pickleball and the PPA,” Ken Solomon, Tennis Channel president, told CNBC. Tennis Channel will have the rights to show most PPA Tour matches, and those that air live on other media networks will be shown on a same-day delay and will be available on-demand on Tennis Channel platforms. Pickleball is not new to the 20-year-old Tennis Channel. The network first aired a PPA Tour event in 2021 and expanded its coverage of pickleball in 2022. Solomon said pickleball ratings have been strong to date. There are 25 PPA Tour events on the 2023 calendar. The network already produces events for the PPA Tour, Dundon added. The joint venture will also allow Tennis Channel to use its marketing and advertising prowess to sell pickleball to sponsors and advertisers by combining their offerings. Solomon said for traditional tennis fans, they don’t have to worry about the paddle sport taking over the bread and butter of their network. The network will not air pickleball in time periods where they have rights to live tennis. “These things, [tennis and pickleball], go together beautifully. It’s like peas and carrots,” he said. Solomon said the Tennis Channel is currently looking at broadcast enhancements through cameras, the use of artificial intelligence, and a jib shot at the net that will allow the audience to see the tension of patience versus pulling the trigger with a slam or drive. It’s been a busy few months for professional pickleball. The PPA Tour, which is a tour-style format pitting the best players in the world against each other, and Major League Pickleball, which features team play, announced earlier this month they are merging. This followed a dramatic few weeks of uncertainty surrounding the future of the professional sport as the leagues engaged in a spending war to compete against each other. In the last few years, pickleball has seen unprecedented growth as professionals and amateurs turn to the sport in droves. According to the annual Sports & Fitness Industry Association Topline Report, pickleball has seen 159% growth over the past three years. Last year, 36 million people played the sport, leading to the growth of both public and private courts all over the country. The sport has also attracted big name players like Bill Gates and the Kardashians to celebrity owners like LeBron James, Patrick Mahomes and Kevin Durant.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,Bezos’ Blue Origin to replace CEO Bob Smith with outgoing Amazon exec Dave Limp,"In this article Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin will replace CEO Bob Smith with outgoing Amazon executive Dave Limp, CNBC has learned. Smith is retiring effective Dec. 4 and will remain with the company until Jan. 2 for the CEO transition, according to notes to Blue Origin staff written by Smith and Bezos that were obtained by CNBC. Limp joins Blue Origin at a key phase of the company’s multiple space projects. Blue needs to ramp production of its BE-4 rocket engines, return its space tourism rocket New Shepard to flight, and launch its next-generation New Glenn rocket for the first time – as well as deliver on a recently-won NASA contract for a crewed lunar lander. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. In a statement to CNBC, a Blue Origin spokesperson praised Limp as “a proven innovator with a customer-first mindset” who has “extensive experience in the high-tech industry and growing highly complex organizations.” Amazon announced last month that Limp would be stepping down later this year. As Amazon’s devices and services chief, Limp oversaw Amazon’s Alexa, Echo and Ring units, as well as some of its more experimental divisions like Zoox autonomous vehicles, and the Project Kuiper internet satellite business. Limp’s resignation came as a shock, as he spent more than 13 years at Amazon. He became a top lieutenant of CEO Andy Jassy and a member of Amazon’s vaunted S-Team, a tight-knit group of senior executives across almost all of its businesses. Additionally, Limp and Bezos worked closely together when the Amazon founder was still CEO. Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant and Echo smart speakers were pet projects of Bezos’, and Limp steered both of the high-profile launches. Amazon has not announced a replacement for Limp yet, but Bloomberg and other outlets have reported that the company is expected to hire Microsoft product chief Panos Panay. Smith took the reins at Blue Origin in 2017 after 13 years at aerospace conglomerate Honeywell, with Bezos annually spending billions to transform his space venture into a sector powerhouse. Under Smith’s leadership, Blue Origin heavily built up infrastructure across the U.S. – adding a key rocket engine manufacturing and testing site in Alabama, expanding its rocket production and launch facilities in Florida, and opening locations in California, Arizona, and Colorado. The most high-profile success during Smith’s tenure came in July 2021, when Bezos flew with the first crew of Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket to the edge of space and back. But delays and setbacks marred each of Blue Origin’s major programs under Smith. Both its marquee New Glenn rocket and BE-4 engines – the latter of which is also needed for fellow rocket company United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan vehicle – are years behind schedule. It lost out on a lucrative round of Pentagon launch contracts in 2020, and needs to fly New Glenn to show the U.S. Space Force is can be awarded military missions in the upcoming round of awards. Earlier this year Blue Origin won a $3.4 billion NASA contract to build a lunar lander for the agency’s astronauts. But the competition was a second-chance contest that NASA organized after Elon Musk’s SpaceX was the sole winner of the first lander contract in 2021 – an award decision that Blue Origin took to federal court and lost. Those schedule slips were compounded by allegations from current and former employees that the company had a toxic and sexist workplace. Smith addressed those claims by saying Blue Origin had “no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” but the company suffered from an elevated turnover rate in 2021. However, Blue Origin has since hired aggressively. Bezos on Monday noting noted the company had grown to more than 10,000 employees, from around 4,000 about two years prior. Read Bezos’ message to Blue Origin employees on Monday: I’m excited to share that Dave Limp will join Blue starting December 4th as CEO, replacing Bob, who has elected to step aside on January 2. The overlap is purposeful to ensure a smooth transition. Before I provide some background on Dave, I’d like to take the time to recognize Bob and the significant growth and transformation we’ve experienced during his tenure. Under Bob’s leadership, Blue has grown to several billion dollars in sales orders, with a substantial backlog for our vehicles and engines. Our team has increased from 850 people when Bob joined to more than 10,000 today. We’ve expanded from one office in Kent to building a launch pad at LC-36 and five million square feet of facilities across seven states. Our mission has grown too – we’ve flown 31 people above the Kármán Line, almost five percent of all the people who have been to space. Flight-qualified BE-4 engines are ready to boost Vulcan into orbit. New Glenn is nearing launch next year, and, with our recent NASA contract, we will land Americans back on the Moon, this time to stay. We have also engaged and inspired millions of children and educators through our Club for the Future efforts. We’ve made tremendous progress in building a road to space for the benefit of Earth, thanks to each of you and Bob’s leadership. I’ve worked closely with Dave for many years. He is the right leader at the right time for Blue. Dave joins us after almost 14 years at Amazon, where he most recently served as senior vice president of Amazon Devices and Services, leading Kuiper, Kindle, Alexa, Zoox, and many other businesses. Before Amazon, Dave had roles at other high-tech companies, including Palm and Apple. Dave is a proven innovator with a customer-first mindset and extensive experience leading and scaling large, complex organizations. Dave has an outstanding sense of urgency, brings energy to everything, and helps teams move very fast. Please join me in welcoming Dave and thanking Bob. Through this transition, I know we’ll remain focused on our customer commitments, production schedules, and executing with speed and operational excellence. I look forward to the many exciting and historic milestones ahead of us! Jeff Read Smith’s message to Blue Origin employees: Team Blue, It’s been about six years since I joined Blue Origin. During that time, our team, facilities, and sales orders have grown dramatically, and we’ve made significant contributions to the history of spaceflight. With pride and satisfaction in all that we’ve accomplished, I’m announcing that effective December 4, I will be stepping aside as Chief Executive Officer of Blue Origin. I will remain with Blue until January 2 to ensure a smooth transition with the new CEO. It has been my privilege to be part of this great team, and I am confident that Blue Origin’s greatest achievements are still ahead of us. We’ve rapidly scaled this company from its prototyping and research roots to a large, prominent space business. We have the right strategy. a supremely talented team, a robust customer base, and some of the most technically ambitious and exciting projects in the entire industry. We also have a team that cares deeply about its mission, legacy, and how we contribute to the next generation and bring everyone into a brighter future. Jeff and I have been discussing my plan for months, and Jeff will announce Blue’s new CEO in a separate note shortly. I’m very excited about the operational excellence and culture of innovation this new leader will bring to Blue. building on the foundation we’ve created over the past few years. I’m committed to ensuring this transition is flawless, and everyone should know that Ill always be on Team Blue. Gradatim Ferociter.

Drew Richardson,"Movie theater shares pop after writers, studios reach tentative labor deal","In this article Movie theater shares popped Monday following news of a tentative labor deal between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. “The world’s movie theatres can celebrate. Extremely good news that progress is being made,” AMC CEO Adam Aron said Sunday in a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Shares of AMC were up roughly 7% Monday. The notoriously volatile stock reached as high as $8.50 a share. Shares of Cinemark and IMAX followed behind, up 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Shares of studio owners, meanwhile, were largely down. Disney and Comcast shares were fractionally lower Monday, while Warner Bros. Discovery fell nearly 4%. While a potential end to the writers’ strike represents positive momentum for Hollywood, union members still need to ratify the deal and even then, it’s still only half the battle. The Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists is still on strike after failure to reach a labor agreement with AMPTP. An eventual deal between SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP is crucial for the well-being of movie theater companies going forward especially as key films such as Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment’s “Dune: Part Two” as well as Sony’s “Kraven the Hunter” and the sequel to “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” were pushed to 2024 because of the strikes. Industry experts fear that more films will be forced to move along the calendar if studios cannot solidify contracts with the two guilds this year. Additionally, some films set for 2024 had filming interrupted because of the strikes and will need to restart production sooner rather than later to hit their opening dates. Still, movie theaters have experienced solid box-office returns this year. The summer season saw a 19% year-over-year increase, due in large part to the success of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” “We would need to see movement on negotiations with SAG-AFTRA to have complete comfort over the near-term slate,” said Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley Securities, in a research note published Monday. “However, should the WGA agreement be ratified by its members, it would allow for writing to restart on upcoming productions to prepare for the point when actors can become involved once again.” SAG-AFTRA released a statement congratulating the WGA for reaching a deal Sunday while also calling for the AMPTP to return to the negotiating table on its own agreements. Despite ongoing turmoil in the media industry, the lengthy writers’ strikes have presented a unique opportunity for streaming companies such as Netflix and their libraries of content. Shares of Netflix gained roughly 1% Monday. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is a member of the AMPTP. — CNBC’s Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,"Merck Covid drug linked to virus mutations that can spread between people, study says","In this article A new study released Monday said Merck ’s widely used antiviral Covid pill can cause mutations in the virus that occasionally spread to other people, raising questions about whether the drug has the potential to accelerate Covid’s evolution.  The findings may increase scrutiny about the usefulness of the treatment, molnupiravir, which was one of the first Covid drugs available to doctors worldwide during the pandemic. Molnupiravir works by causing mutations in Covid’s genetic information, which weakens or destroys the virus and reduces the amount of Covid in the body. However, the study published Monday in the scientific journal Nature found that Covid can sometimes survive treatment with molnupiravir, leading to mutated versions of the virus that have been found to spread to other patients.  Researchers in the U.S. and U.K. specifically analyzed 15 million Covid genomes to see which mutations had occurred and when. They found that mutations increased in 2022 after molnupiravir was introduced in many countries.  There is no evidence that molnupiravir, sold under the brand name Lagevrio, has produced more transmissible or severe variants of Covid, according to the study.  But the findings are important for regulators who continue to assess the risks and benefits of molnupiravir, wrote Theo Sanderson, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the Francis Crick Institute in London, in a post on X, formerly Twitter. A spokesperson for Merck pushed back on the new study, claiming the researchers assumed that the mutations they analyzed were associated with molnupiravir-treated patients “without documented evidence of that transmission.” “Instead, the authors rely on circumstantial associations between the region from which the sequence was identified and timeframe of sequence collection in countries where molnupiravir is available to draw their conclusion,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that genomes with the mutations were “uncommon and were associated with sporadic cases.”  The company in February also disputed an earlier study by the same team of researchers, which suggested that molnupiravir is giving rise to new mutations of the virus in some patients. Based on data at the time, a spokesperson for Merck said it didn’t believe molnupiravir was likely to contribute to Covid mutations. The new study comes as Covid once again gains a stronger foothold in the U.S., primarily driven by newer strains of the virus. But the U.S. and other countries appear to be relying less on molnupiravir to fend off Covid this year: Sales of the drug dropped to around $200 million during Merck’s third quarter, down 83% from the more than $1 billion reported during the same period a year ago.  Merck’s molnupiravir has long been controversial because of its ability to cause genetic mutations.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration first approved the drug for emergency use in late 2021. But the FDA recommends against using Lagevrio during pregnancy because non-clinical studies suggest that it may cause fetal harm. Molnupiravir also isn’t authorized for use in patients under 18 because it may affect bone and cartilage growth.",CNBC
Michael Sheetz,Sierra Space raises nearly $300 million at over $5 billion valuation,"Sierra Space, the subsidiary of private aerospace contractor Sierra Nevada Corporation, raised new funds at a $5.3 billion valuation, the company announced on Tuesday. Sierra Space’s equity raise of $290 million was led by Japanese investors MUFG, Kanematsu and Tokio Marine, with significant participation from prior investors and insiders. Citigroup advised on the deal. “Sierra Space is excited to create a long-term strategic relationship with our Japanese investors and industry partners,” CEO Tom Vice said in a statement. CNBC previously reported the fundraise. MUFG is the largest bank in Japan, and Sierra noted the trio of investors are already working with the country’s space agency to study the market opportunity in low Earth orbit – where the International Space Station operates currently. “MUFG has decided to invest in Low Earth Orbit to support commercialization, the creation of new industries, and the resolution of social issues,” MUFG Bank President and CEO Junichi Hanzawa said in a statement. Two years ago, Sierra Space raised $1.4 billion at a $4.5 billion valuation from investors including General Atlantic, BlackRock, AE Industrial Partners, Coatue and Moore Strategic Ventures. The fresh funds come as Sierra Space focuses on getting its Dream Chaser spaceplane flying. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC’s Investing in Space newsletter. Dream Chaser has been in development for years with a goal to deliver cargo and eventually crew to low Earth orbit as a reusable vehicle. It resembles a miniaturized NASA Space Shuttle in appearance and is built to launch atop a traditional rocket and land on a runway like an airplane. The first Dream Chaser launch was previously scheduled for late last year, but delays in the development of United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket pushed back that timeline. Dream Chaser is planned to launch on ULA’s second Vulcan mission, with the first Vulcan launch targeting the fourth quarter of this year. Sierra Space is also one of several companies working on a private space station. It plans to launch a “pathfinder” demonstration mission of its LIFE (Large Integrated Flexible Environment) habitat in 2026.",CNBC
Jessica Golden,Pickleball is loud. The people behind the sport say they’re trying to fix it,"America’s fastest-growing sport is looking to be … quieter? The governing body of the sport, USA Pickleball, announced on Monday a new initiative to get pickleball to pipe down by investing in changes to the acoustics of the sport. The organization will work with manufacturers and facilities to come up with solutions that will allow the sport to continue its rapid growth. Pickleball is a paddle sport that combines the elements of tennis, ping pong and badminton. It’s played with a plastic ball with holes in it that resembles a wiffle ball. While the sport was created in the 1960s, it recently gained steam during the Covid-19 pandemic, as people looked for ways to get exercise outdoors and also be social. As a result, courts are popping up all across the country, including even in people’s backyards and neighborhoods. USA Pickleball says 130 new locations were added per month in 2022 and estimates another 25,000 courts will need to be built to keep up with demand. Last year, 36 million people played pickleball and the sport has grown 158% over the past three years according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Yet not everyone has caught pickleball fever. Read more: Professional Pickleball, Tennis Channel deepen media partnership The pop-pop-pop sound that the sport produces with its rapid-fire paddle play has led to neighborhood quarrels, lawsuits and 911 calls. The cacophonous controversy has even prompted the closure of some courts. “It’s a torture technique,” one pickleball antagonist told The New York Times in June. In the 70 decibel range, sound experts say it’s not a dangerous amount of noise but it’s about twice as loud as tennis. USA Pickleball is looking to quiet the commotion — and cultivate good will — by announcing a new “quiet category” for pickleball equipment. “With the sport’s growth, addressing noise concerns is essential to maintain a positive relationship between residential communities and facility operators,” USA Pickleball CEO Mike Nealy said in a statement. “By working together with manufacturers and the entire industry, we can develop quieter options that benefit everyone.” The small northern New Jersey town of Haworth experienced a pickleball explosion among its residents during the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, in an attempt to keep the peace amid noise complaints, the town decided to move its pickleball courts. “Residents showed up at council meetings expressing the noise issue,” said Kari Heitzner, co-chair of the town’s pickleball club. “Because it’s such a popular sport with people wanting to play at all hours of the day, we ultimately decided to move the courts to an area surrounded by woods.” The USA Pickleball initiative aims to help municipalities and homeowners associations seek support navigating the noise and to provide them with remote and on-site evaluations. It’s also helping to promote products that deliver essentially 50% or less of the acoustic footprint. The organization said it has spent the past 15 months researching and studying the acoustic output of the sport, including by working with acoustic experts. “I would say that it’s probably less than 1% [of people complaining about the noise], but it is a very vocal 1% that do have issues with it. So we do feel the need to address it and make sure that there are solutions,” Carl Schmits, USA Pickleball managing director of equipment standards and facilities development, said in an interview. The goal is to work with manufacturers during development to prioritize innovation in creating quieter products, in addition to providing resources to municipalities. Schmits says the organization has tested hundreds of paddles and worked with suppliers on dampening the noise through acoustic fabrics and panels. Bob Unetich, sound engineer and pickleball player, has been studying this problem for the past eight years. Unetich, who consults for USA Pickleball, started a company called Pickleball Sound Mitigation to help communities with this growing problem. He said pickleball paddles vibrate at a high pitch of 1,000 times per second, which is what leads to the pop noise. Humans are sensitive to pop sounds and often annoyed by them, he added. “I appreciate the problem and frankly wouldn’t want to live next door to numbers like 70 decibels over and over and over every four seconds for eight hours a day,” Unetich said. “And I’m sure you wouldn’t either.”",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,Pfizer restarts production at tornado-hit North Carolina plant,"In this article Pfizer on Monday said it has restarted most production lines at a drug manufacturing plant that was severely damaged by a tornado two months ago, but added that some medicines from the facility may be in short supply until at least mid 2024. In a statement, Pfizer stressed that it has only made the “first step toward full recovery” of its plant in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The company expects the facility’s operations to fully resume by the end of the year. The Rocky Mount plant supplies nearly 8% of all sterile injectable medicines used in U.S. hospitals, including anesthesia, analgesia, therapeutics, anti-infectives and neuromuscular blockers. The facility also manufactures about 25% of the company’s drugs in that category.  Pfizer in August warned hospitals that some medicines could see supply disruptions.  One injection from the plant was in short supply as of late last month, according to a database from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. It was a type of sodium chloride injection, which is used to replenish water and salt lost as a result of certain conditions.  Pfizer on Monday said it has restarted production of about 13 medicines, which were prioritized based on “patient need and inventory levels.” The company did not specify which drugs those are. Pfizer said it is also continuing to monitor emergency request orders for certain medicines manufactured at the Rocky Mount plant. The company implemented the emergency ordering process in August to manage the distribution of 12 drugs “in high medical need.” Pfizer’s announcement comes as the U.S. is already facing an unprecedented shortage of medicine, ranging from ADHD pills to pain medicine to injectable cancer therapies. Those shortages are driven by manufacturing quality control issues and surges in demand, among other factors.",CNBC
Robert Frank,"A tour inside Manhattan’s newest private club, with $100,000 membership fees","A battle between elite membership clubs is about to reach a whole new level, as Core Club’s new 60,000-square-foot megaclub prepares to open in Manhattan next month. The new Core space, spread over four floors above Midtown, is the latest in a wave of elite membership clubs that have opened in major cities since the pandemic. From Casa Cipriani and Zero Bond in New York, to the Aster and Heimat in Los Angeles and ZZ’s Club in Miami, the clubs have redefined the old-world membership clubs and created safe spaces for today’s privacy-minded, highly mobile wealthy. More than a dozen new clubs have opened or announced plans to open in Manhattan since 2020. Some, like Aman, are offshoots of hotel brands. Others, like ZZ’s and Casa Cipriani, leverage the cult-like fan base of their restaurants. Many are geographic expansions of existing hotspots, like LA’s famed San Vicente Bungalows opening in New York. The club boom has created an arms race of amenities, with clubs vying to outdo each other with dining spaces, celebrity chefs, wellness spas, gyms, bars, pools, nightclubs, plush hotel suites and high-tech board rooms. ZZ’s Club, owned by Major Food Group and scheduled to open in Hudson Yards this fall, will boast multiple restaurants and a “culinary concierge” — a team of chefs able to whip up any dish that it’s members request. “No one’s ever done this before,” said Jeff Zalaznick, managing partner for Major Food Group. “We’ve got so much talent in this kitchen. If you want your mother’s meatloaf in two days, we can make it. You want fried chicken, we can make it and probably make a great version.” The price for access is soaring: the Aman Club in Manhattan, part of Aman New York’s new 83-suite hotel, charges $200,000 for membership along with $15,000 a year in annual dues. Core’s memberships range from $15,000 for an individual membership to $100,000 for a family membership, along with annual dues of $15,000 to $18,000 a year. With more clubs scheduled to open in the fourth quarter and beginning of next year, some members worry that New York and other big cities are becoming over-saturated with club offerings, especially if the economy plunges into recession. Club owners and managers say they see no slowdown in demand, as the wealthy seek communities and private spaces where they can work, play, stay and network in a secure and exclusive space. Industry watchers say the U.S. may be moving toward the London model of social clubs, where storied institutions like Annabel’s, 5 Hertford Street and White’s play a central role in the social and professional lives of the upper crust. Soho House, founded in London in 1995 by restauranteur Nick Jones, has expanded to become the global goliath of the private club world, with dozens of locations around the world and a publicly traded stock. Core Club’s founder and CEO, Jennie Enterprise, said that after the pandemic, the wealthy value privacy and a sense of community more than ever. “I think the proliferation of private clubs is a reflection of an exceptional business model,” she said. “The annuity subscription-based business model in any industry is attractive. The activity in the space certainly reflects a desire for curated communities and experiences. And probably with a dynamic of social media, and a lack of privacy, I think that discretion and private communities are probably something that is more aligned with the culture of the moment.” Club owners say members often join multiple clubs, since each has its own focus and atmosphere. Zero Bond, founded by nightclub impresario Scott Sartiano, has more of a nightclub vibe and has hosted Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson and Gigi Hadid. Aman has the hushed (some say eerily quiet) feel of a zen resort, while Casa Cipriani features the flashy, people-watching theater of Cipriani’s storied New York eateries. Zalaznick said his affluent clientele is “spending more than ever” at ZZ’s Club in Miami and the company’s high-end restaurants, which bodes well for the forthcoming ZZ’s Club New York. “The things that bring people back are great food, great service, great experiences, great connections and the staff’s ability to cater to people’s needs or desires,” he said. “That’s our focus, and that’s what will give us longevity in the club space.” Core gave CNBC an exclusive first tour of its new club at 711 Fifth Avenue, scheduled to open in mid-October. The group opened its first space in 2005 at a nearby location on 55th street and became the most successful of the new breed of modern, business-oriented membership clubs. In need of more space and a fresh look, Core leased four floors on the top of the former Coca-Cola building and spent two years and tens of millions of dollars building the ideal layout. Spanning the 15th through 18th floors, Core has over 6,000 square feet of outdoor terrace space with views of Central Park and the glass towers of Midtown. The 15th floor houses 11 luxury hotel suites, which are between 500 and 750 square feet apiece. Priced at around $1,500 per night, the rooms will be available for guests or their family members. The same floor also houses a spa with treatment rooms and a salon. The 16th floor is home to the gym, juice bar and the Dangene Institute, which features the latest in anti-aging skincare technology. On the 17th floor, members will find a speakeasy-style lounge, which includes a stylish bar, blue velvet couches and a glass wine and champagne vault, called the wine library. Another set of glass doors leads to the culinary lab, a U-shaped table where celebrity chefs from around the world will serve up special dishes for members. The 18th floor houses the more formal dining area, which will serve mostly Mediterranean fare during the day and a more seasonal, varied menu at night. Core’s culinary program is headed by Chef Michele Brogioni, the celebrated former executive chef at Giorgio Armani. The club’s bread and pastries (including what is arguably New York’s best lemon cake) is overseen by head pastry chef Mauro Pompili. The 18th floor also houses state-of-the art conference and board rooms, a screening room and a flexible events space and gallery that can be used for exhibits, parties and big gatherings. Along with the Manhattan club, Core has new locations in Milan and San Francisco and has plans for several others in the coming years, Enterprise said. Yet Core’s main draw, she said, isn’t the spaces or the amenities, but the community and well-spring of ideas. Core produces between 150 and 200 cultural events a year, from performances, exhibits and talks, to tastings, interviews and showcases. “We’re ideas-led, not amenities-led,” Enterprise said. “Clearly we have beautiful, world-class amenities. But what defines us is the quality of our ideas. We curate a community of relentlessly curious and unlike-minded people from across the spectrum. So people can intersect with other people from media sports, fashion, finance, science, technology, design and beyond. Our commitment to cultural programming reflects a desire for our members to endlessly cultivate themselves.” While Core never discloses the names of any of its members, some cited in past media reports include Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, fashion designer Tory Burch, Vornado CEO Steven Roth and Estee Lauder Executive Chairman William Lauder. Since the new location is nearly twice the size as its prior outpost and can accommodate more members, Core is accepting and starting to review new applications. “We are getting a lot of applications,” Enterprise said. “There is no single requirement. We look for interesting, curious people who will add to the community.”",CNBC
Sarah Whitten,Hollywood writers reach tentative deal with studios to end strike,"In this article Hollywood’s writers and studios have a preliminary labor agreement. Talks between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers resumed last week after months of starts and stops, ultimately leading to a tentative deal that would end the ongoing writers strike. The WGA and AMPTP are still drafting the final contract language. “What we have won in this contract — most particularly, everything we have gained since May 2nd — is due to the willingness of this membership to exercise its power, to demonstrate its solidarity, to walk side-by-side, to endure the pain and uncertainty of the past 146 days,” the WGA negotiation committee wrote in a letter to members Sunday night. “It is the leverage generated by your strike, in concert with the extraordinary support of our union siblings, that finally brought the companies back to the table to make a deal.” Hollywood scribes initiated a work stoppage in early May as negotiations broke down with studios including Disney , Paramount , Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery . Television and film writers sought protections against the use of artificial intelligence, in addition to increases in compensation for streamed content. The WGA did not disclose what provisions ultimately made it into the preliminary contract, but told union members that “this deal is exceptional — with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership.” Once the WGA and AMPTP agree on the language within the contract, the negotiating committee will vote on whether to recommend the agreement and send it to the Writers Guild of America West Board and the Writers Guild of America East Council for approval. Then, the board and council will vote on whether to authorize a contract ratification vote by membership. WGA leadership noted that the strike is not over and no members of the guild are to return to work until the agreement is officially ratified. Members were encouraged to continue standing in solidarity with striking actors on the picket lines. President Joe Biden, who often touts his pro-union stances, cheered the agreement as he prepares to head to a United Auto Workers’ picket line Tuesday in Michigan. “This agreement, including assurances related to artificial intelligence, did not come easily,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House on Monday. “But its formation is a testament to the power of collective bargaining. There simply is no substitute for employers and employees coming together to negotiate in good faith toward an agreement that makes a business stronger and secures the pay, benefits, and dignity that workers deserve.” Following negotiations with writers, the AMPTP will need to turn its attention to SAG-AFTRA. The acting guild’s members have been on strike since mid-July and are seeking contract updates similar to those requested by the writers. Hollywood performers are looking to improve wages, working conditions, and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV. “SAG-AFTRA congratulates the WGA on reaching a tentative agreement with the AMPTP after 146 days of incredible strength, resiliency and solidarity on the picket lines,” the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists wrote in a statement Sunday. “While we look forward to reviewing the WGA and AMPTP’s tentative agreement, we remain committed to achieving the necessary terms for our members.” Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.

Jenni Reid,Nissan commits to all-electric vehicle sales in Europe,"Japanese carmarker Nissan announced Monday that all new models it launches in Europe will be fully electric, as it reaffirmed its aim for solely electric vehicle sales on the continent by 2030. It said it was “pressing ahead” with the existing target just a week after the U.K. pushed back a ban on the sale of new gasoline and diesel car sales from 2030 to 2035. “There is no turning back now,” Makoto Uchida, Nissan president and CEO, said in a statement. “We believe it is the right thing to do for our business, our customers and for the planet.” It says one-third of the more than 1 million EVs it has sold worldwide have been in Europe. Globally, Nissan plans to launch 27 electric and hybrid vehicles, which includes 19 all-electric models, by 2030. The company was an early pioneer in the EV space but has struggled with competition from Tesla and China’s BYD. It also plans to introduce cobalt-free technology to reduce the cost of EV batteries by 65% by fiscal 2028 and launch a vehicle with its own all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) by that year. It claims these will reduce current charging times by two thirds. Nissan partner Renault , as well as rivals Ford and Stellantis, have all announced plans to make their European passenger ranges fully electric by 2030. The U.K.’s pushback of the 2030 sales target was criticised by Ford UK Chair Lisa Brankin, who said it created uncertainty and risked taking focus away from the EV transition. Nissan confirmed one of its upcoming EVs will be made in its plant in Sunderland in the U.K. “Sunderland is one of our major plants where we have history, cost competitiveness ... and we would like to further show our electrification strategy here in this country,” Uchida told CNBC’s Arjun Khapal at the Nissan Design Europe studio in London. Uchida said the automotive industry was “evolving and challenging everywhere in the world.” In China, he said the company would look to launch cars more quickly and launch new models targeting specific consumers.",CNBC
Amelia Lucas,McDonald’s to raise royalty fees for new franchised restaurants,"In this article McDonald’s franchisees who add new restaurants will soon have to pay higher royalty fees. The fast-food giant is raising those fees from 4% to 5%, starting Jan. 1. It’s the first time in nearly three decades that McDonald’s is hiking its royalty fees. The change will not affect existing franchisees who are maintaining their current footprint or who buy a franchised location from another operator. It will also not apply to rebuilt existing locations or restaurants transferred between family members. However, the higher rate will affect new franchisees, buyers of company-owned restaurants, relocated restaurants and other scenarios that involve the franchisor. “While we created the industry we now lead, we must continue to redefine what success looks like and position ourselves for long-term success to ensure the value of our brand remains as strong as ever,” McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger said in a message to U.S. franchisees viewed by CNBC. McDonald’s will also stop calling the payments “service fees,” and instead use the term “royalty fees,” which most franchisors favor. “We’re not changing services, but we are trying to change the mindset by getting people to see and understand the power of what you buy into when you buy the McDonald’s brand, the McDonald’s system,” Erlinger told CNBC. Franchisees run about 95% of McDonald’s roughly 13,400 U.S. restaurants. They pay rent, monthly royalty fees and other charges, such as annual fees toward the company’s mobile app, in order to operate as part of McDonald’s system. The royalty fee hikes probably won’t affect many franchisees right away. However, backlash will likely come, due to the company’s rocky relationship with its U.S. operators. McDonald’s and its franchisees have clashed over a number of issues in recent years, including a new assessment system for restaurants and a California bill that will hike wages for fast-food workers by 25% next year. In the second quarter, McDonald’s franchisees rated their relationship with corporate management at a 1.71 out of 5, in a quarterly survey of several dozen of the chain’s operators conducted by Kalinowski Equity Research. It’s the survey’s highest mark since the fourth quarter of 2021, but still a far cry from the potential high score of 5. Late Friday, The National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of more than 1,000 McDonald’s owners, sent out a memo to its membership regarding the news from corporate. The memo, viewed by CNBC, called Friday an “extremely hectic day” as U.S. owners woke up to emails from CFO Ian Borden and U.S. President Erlinger about the decision to increase service fees for new owners and reclassify the name to royalties.  “Although McDonald’s believes they have the right to make changes to their fee structure, franchise agreement terms and the conditions of engagement, these self-proclaimed rights do not establish that the changes are the right thing to do for the business, the relationship, or the future of our Brand,” the memo said, adding that while system gross sales have increased to start this year, resulting in “record-breaking revenue” for corporate, the benefits are not evident in franchisee cash flow. The memo goes on, adding that franchisee restaurant cash flow has not kept pace with inflation, and that owners are flowing less money today than they were in 2010. “What’s more, per restaurant EBITDA percent is crashing and will likely hit a 12-year low of around 12.25% in Q4, or certainly in 2024. In spite of the incredible sales growth the restaurants are driving, franchisees are making less money per restaurant today than they did in 2010,” the memo states. The NOA memo also says the change in terminology from service fees to royalties is “very significant” and will have a key impact on the owners’ “rights to receive the all-important services, support and assistance that McDonald’s is now obligated to provide us,” claiming it removes the company’s duty to provide services. It urges owners to carefully review agreements received from the company and have an experienced attorney review them before executing, and says reinvestment decisions should be reconsidered, as those looking to open new restaurants will not have a “historical return” provided, due to the change. This is the latest outcry from owner advocates against corporate, as the NOA just last week sent out a communication to its members regarding California’s AB 1228, claiming the legislation would have a “devastating financial impact” on operators in the state. McDonald’s declined to comment on the NOA’s position on both the service fee change and the California negotiations. Despite the turmoil, McDonald’s U.S. business is booming. In its most recent quarter, domestic same-store sales grew 10.3%. Promotions such as the Grimace Birthday Meal and strong demand for McDonald’s core menu items, such as Big Macs and McNuggets, fueled sales. Franchisee cash flows rose year over year as a result, McDonald’s CFO Borden said in late July. The company said average cash flows for U.S. operators have climbed 35% over the last five years.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,"UAW targets 38 facilities at GM and Stellantis for expanded strikes, skips Ford","In this article DETROIT — The United Auto Workers is expanding strikes to 38 parts and distribution locations across 20 states, targeting General Motors and Stellantis , UAW President Shawn Fain said Friday morning. The union will not initiate additional strikes at Ford Motor , as the company has proven it’s “serious about reaching a deal,” Fain said in a Facebook Live comment. “We still have serious issues to work through, but we do want to recognize that Ford is showing that they’re serious about reaching a deal,” said the outspoken union leader. “At GM and Stellantis, it’s a different story.” Fain said the union and Ford have made progress on issues including eliminating some wage tiers, reinstating cost-of-living adjustments and an improved profit-sharing formula. He also said the union won the right to strike over plant closures during the term of the deal as well as an immediate conversion of temporary, or supplemental, workers — those with at least 90 days of employment — upon ratification. Ford said the company is “working diligently with the UAW to reach a deal,” but “we still have significant gaps to close on the key economic issues.” “In the end, the issues are interconnected and must work within an overall agreement that supports our mutual success,” Ford said in a statement Friday. The strikes at the GM and Stellantis parts suppliers will add roughly 5,600 autoworkers, including roughly 3,500 employees at GM, to the UAW’s ongoing strikes at the Detroit automakers. “Today’s strike escalation by the UAW’s top leadership is unnecessary,” GM said in a statement. “We have now presented five separate economic proposals that are historic, addressing areas that our team members have said matters most: wage increases and job security while allowing GM to succeed and thrive into the future. “We will continue to bargain in good faith with the union to reach an agreement as quickly as possible,” the automaker said. Stellantis said in a statement it questions “whether the union’s leadership has ever had an interest in reaching an agreement in a timely manner.” Roughly 12,700 UAW workers went on strike a week ago at the following locations: GM’s midsize truck and full-size van plant in Wentzville, Missouri; Ford’s Ranger midsize pickup and Bronco SUV plant in Wayne, Michigan; and Stellantis’ Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator plant in Toledo, Ohio. Parts distribution centers have been a major point of concern during these talks, especially at Stellantis. The automaker has proposed consolidating 10 “Mopar” parts and distribution centers, which are scattered across the country, into larger Amazon-like distribution centers. GM has agreed to eliminate the wage differences at its parts and components plants, according to Fain. He commended the Detroit automaker for that action but condemned it for resisting further measures that Ford has agreed to with the union. Targeting the parts and distribution centers is a unique strategy. It does not affect the production and assembly of vehicles but rather the distribution of parts to dealers. The new work stoppages, if prolonged, could cause significant disruption for dealers, which could in turn delay fixes for customers. Repair wait times have already been problematic due to recent supply chain issues. “This will impact these two companies repairs operations,” Fain said. “Our message to the consumer is simple: The way to fix the frustrating customer experience is for the companies to end price gouging. Invest these record profits into stable jobs and stable wages and benefits.” Many, including Wall Street analysts, expected the union to expand work stoppages to full-size truck plants of the Detroit automakers, which are crucial to the profitability of the companies. The affected facilities for GM include 18 plants in 13 states: Michigan, Ohio, Colorado, Wisconsin, Illinois, Nevada, California, Texas, West Virginia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. For Stellantis, the extended strikes affect 20 facilities in 14 states: Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, Illinois, California, Oregon, Georgia, Virginia, Florida, Texas, New York and Massachusetts. “This expansion will also take our fight nationwide,” Fain said. “We will keep going, keep organizing and keep expanding the stand-up strike as necessary.” UAW began targeted strikes after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by the expiration of the previous contracts at 11:59 p.m. Sept. 14. The additional plant strikes come despite record contract offers from the automakers, including roughly 20% hourly wage increases, thousands of dollars in bonuses, retention of the union’s platinum health care and other sweetened benefits. Stellantis said on Friday it had made a “very competitive offer” that would see current full-time hourly employees earning between $80,000 and $96,000 a year by the end of the contract, constituting a 21.4% compounded increase; a long-term solution for an idled factory in Belvidere, Illinois; and, “significant product allocation that allows for workforce stability through the end of the contract.” “We still have not received a response to that offer,” the company said. The union has demanded 40% hourly pay increases, a shortened workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, the elimination of compensation tiers and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, among other improvements. The additional strikes come a day after The Detroit News Thursday night reported leaked messages involving UAW communications director Jonah Furman that raised questions about the union’s motives for the work stoppages. In the undated private group messages, viewed by CNBC, Furman describes UAW’s strategy and targeted strikes as causing “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos.” Furman, who did not respond for comment, said if the union “can keep them wounded for months they don’t know what to do.” Fain did not address the messages on Facebook Live beyond discussing the union’s strategy of “doing things differently” to “win record contracts.” — CNBC’s Gabriel Cortes and John Rosevear contributed to this report.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,Automakers question UAW’s strike motives after leaked ‘chaos’ messages,"In this article DETROIT — Major automakers are calling into question the United Auto Workers’ motives in launching targeted strikes in light of leaked messages by a union director calling to “keep them wounded for months.” The private group messages on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, show UAW communications director Jonah Furman discussing the union’s public posturing of issues and targeted strikes as causing “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” to the automakers. The messages, which were viewed by CNBC and first reported Thursday by The Detroit News, don’t align with UAW President Shawn Fain’s public statements that the union has been negotiating in good faith and is available “24/7 to bargain a deal.” “It’s now clear that the UAW leadership has always intended to cause months-long disruption, regardless of the harm it causes to its members and their communities,” General Motors said in an emailed statement. “The leaked information calls into question who is actually in charge of UAW strategy and shows a callous disregard for the seriousness of what is at stake.” Executives with the automakers, including GM CEO Mary Barra and Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley, publicly voiced frustration with the union’s bargaining, or lack thereof, ahead of a union-imposed strike deadline at 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 14. Ford communications chief Mark Truby said in a statement Friday that the leaked messages are “disappointing, to say the least, given what is at stake for our employees, the companies and this region.” Chrysler-parent Stellantis described the messages as “incredibly disturbing” and said they “strongly indicate that the UAW’s approach to these talks is not in the best interest of the workforce.” “We are disappointed that it appears our employees are being used as pawns in an agenda that is not intended to meet their needs,” Stellantis said in an emailed statement. Furman, who has been readily available during the negotiations, did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment Friday. Calls to his phone went directly to a full voicemail. In response to The Detroit News, Furman would not confirm writing the messages but according to the paper, called them “private messages” that “you shouldn’t have.” Furman, a former staff writer and organizer for Labor Notes, is involved with the union’s messaging, media communications, speech writing and internal communications. The leaked messages come as Fain on Friday announced additional plants the union plans to strike as part of its “stand-up strikes,” a nod to historic “sit-down” strikes by the UAW in the 1930s. In one message, Furman describes Fain, who has touted faith and worship in recent messages to union members, as “our folksy gen x class struggle Christian white dude from Indiana who quotes Malcom X.” The expanded strikes come despite record contract offers from the automakers, including roughly 20% hourly wage increases, thousands of dollars in bonuses, retention of the union’s platinum health care and other sweetened benefits. The union has demanded 40% hourly pay increases, a shortened workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, the elimination of compensation tiers and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, among other contract improvements. Each of the automakers said they will continue to collectively bargain with UAW negotiators in an attempt to reach tentative agreements for the 146,000 autoworkers under the contracts.",CNBC
Lillian Rizzo,Amazon is bringing ads to Prime Video — ad-free tier to cost extra $2.99 a month,"In this article Ads are coming to Amazon ’s Prime Video. The company announced Friday that its streaming service — a part of Prime subscriptions that cost $14.99 a month — will now have limited ads in its TV series and movies. Advertising on Prime Video, known for shows such as “The Boys” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” will roll out in the U.S. and other cities in early 2024, with other countries to follow later in the year. If U.S. customers don’t want commercials, they will have to pay an additional $2.99 a month. Live events and sports will continue to feature ads in this tier, the company said in its announcement. Prime customers will get an email in the weeks leading up to the advertising rollout, which will include the option to sign up for the ad-free tier. “To continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time, starting in early 2024, Prime Video shows and movies will include limited advertisements,” the company said in a post Friday. Amazon said it plans to have “meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming providers.” Prime Video will now join rival streaming services, including Netflix , Warner Bros. Discovery ’s Max and Disney ’s Hulu and Disney+, that are leaning on advertising. The ad-supported options are not only giving consumers a cheaper option as the list of streaming apps grows, but are also bringing in an additional revenue source. Media companies in particular have been trying a variety of ways to make the streaming business profitable, from advertising to password-sharing crackdowns to cost cutting. Streaming behemoth Netflix switched gears late last year and began offering a cheaper, ad-supported plan. Netflix was slow to embrace advertising, but as subscriber growth slowed, the company instituted the option in an effort to boost revenue. The company recently removed its cheapest, ad-free plan in a push to get more sign-ups for its ad option. Company executives have said the economics of its ad plan were higher than the basic plan, and that advertising is incremental to Netflix’s revenue and profit.",CNBC
Lillian Rizzo,Rupert Murdoch steps down as chairman of Fox and News Corp.,"In this article Rupert Murdoch is stepping down as chairman of the board of both Fox Corp. and News Corp. , the companies said Thursday. The move will be official in November. Murdoch, 92, will be appointed chairman emeritus of each company. Lachlan Murdoch, one of his sons, will become sole chairman of News Corp. and will continue as Fox Corp.’s executive chair and CEO. “Our companies are in robust health, as am I,” the elder Murdoch said in a note to employees. “We have every reason to be optimistic about the coming years – I certainly am, and plan to be here to participate in them. But the battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought, has never been more intense.” Murdoch is stepping away from the boards after a tumultuous year at Fox’s TV network, soon after the company agreed to pay a $787.5 million settlement in the Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation lawsuit over false claims that the company’s machines swayed the 2020 election between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Murdoch’s continued role behind the scenes at Fox News was highlighted in the months leading up the Dominion settlement. In his deposition for the lawsuit, Murdoch said some of the network’s anchors parroted false claims in the months following the election. Until the settlement, Dominion was calling for Murdoch, his son, and other top Fox talent and executives to take the stand if a trial occurred. At the time, Fox had opposed having the elder Murdoch — as well as other top Fox executives — appearing in person, citing his age. A Delaware judge rejected the argument, and had said Fox wouldn’t have been able to argue hardship given Murdoch’s engagement that was later called off and his publicly discussed travel plans. Since July 2022, Murdoch had worked from his home in Montana rather than going into Fox or News Corp. offices, according to a securities filing. Fox News also saw top talent Tucker Carlson exit earlier this year, followed by a dip in ratings for a period before he was replaced. Murdoch’s departure also comes a year ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential election. News Corp. owns newspapers The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, among other publications, while Fox is the parent company of right-leaning TV networks Fox News and Fox Business. The Australian media mogul got his start in the industry nearly 70 years ago in 1954, after taking control of what was called News Ltd., which owned the No. 2 newspaper in Adelaide, Australia. His father was a war correspondent and regional newspaper owner. From there he built his newspaper empire, stretching to racy tabloids in Britain and later the U.S. In the 1980s, he entered the television business, and bought oil tycoon Marvin Davis’ 50% stake in Twentieth Century Fox in 1985. He became a U.S. citizen that year in order to meet the requirement for owning TV stations in the country. In 1996 the Fox News Channel was launched, and has since become a top-rated cable network. “For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change,” Murdoch said in his note to employees, adding it was time for him to take on different roles. Nearly a year ago, Murdoch explored reuniting Fox and News Corp., a move that would have allowed leadership to be consolidated in his media empire, as well as cutting costs. Murdoch had split up News Corp. and Fox in 2013. The proposal had come as audiences shrink for both print media and cable TV, while readers and viewers increasingly get their news and entertainment from online news, social media and streaming. However, Murdoch called off the proposed merger in January. Murdoch had withdrawn the proposal for the reunion, saying in a letter to the board that he and his son “determined that a combination is not optimal for the shareholders” of either of the companies at the time. The Murdoch family trust controls roughly 40% of the voting rights of both companies. The family is said to have amassed a fortune of more than $17 billion as of 2023. Fox and its broadcast and pay TV networks are left over from the $71.3 billion Twenty-First Century Fox sale to Disney in 2019. The media company has focused on news and sports — primarily for its traditional TV networks — as well as the free, ad-supported streamer Tubi, rather than jumping into the direct-to-consumer subscription streaming business like its peers. Fox, which saw its stock move up slightly on Thursday, has a market cap of more than $15.5 billion. News Corp. has a market cap of more than $11 billion. The Murdochs’ time and power in media has been chronicled over the years in books, as well as considered to be loosely portrayed in the HBO series “Succession.” In coming days, Michael Wolff’s “The Fall: The End of Fox News and the Murdoch Dynasty,” will be released and is said to include more revelations about the Murdoch family, U.S. politics and Fox News. Read Murdoch’s full note to employees: Dear Colleagues, I am writing to let you all know that I have decided to transition to the role of Chairman Emeritus at Fox and News. For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change. But the time is right for me to take on different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams and a passionate, principled leader in Lachlan who will become sole Chairman of both companies. Neither excessive pride nor false humility are admirable qualities. But I am truly proud of what we have achieved collectively through the decades, and I owe much to my colleagues, whose contributions to our success have sometimes been unseen outside the company but are deeply appreciated by me. Whether the truck drivers distributing our papers, the cleaners who toil when we have left the office, the assistants who support us or the skilled operators behind the cameras or the computer code, we would be less successful and have less positive impact on society without your day-after-day dedication. Our companies are in robust health, as am I. Our opportunities far exceed our commercial challenges. We have every reason to be optimistic about the coming years - I certainly am, and plan to be here to participate in them. But the battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought, has never been more intense. My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause. Self-serving bureaucracies are seeking to silence those who would question their provenance and purpose. Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth. In my new role, I can guarantee you that I will be involved every day in the contest of ideas. Our companies are communities, and I will be an active member of our community. I will be watching our broadcasts with a critical eye, reading our newspapers and websites and books with much interest, and reaching out to you with thoughts, ideas, and advice. When I visit your countries and companies, you can expect to see me in the office late on a Friday afternoon. I look forward to seeing you wherever you work and whatever your responsibility. And I urge you to make the most of this great opportunity to improve the world we live in.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,Where key issues stand as UAW closes in on extended strikes against automakers,"In this article DETROIT — With a deadline for expanded strikes by the United Auto Workers against the Detroit automakers closing in, the “serious progress” called for by the union seems all too elusive. The UAW and General Motors , Ford Motor and Stellantis are all holding their ground on demands, and it appears likely the union will strike additional plants at some, if not all, of the automakers at noon Friday — as it’s warned. While talks are ongoing, there has been little reported movement in proposals since the strikes were initiated on Sept. 15 at assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. Sources familiar with the talks describe a “big” gap in demands and the parties being “far apart.” Headline economic issues and benefits such as hourly pay, retirement benefits, cost-of-living adjustments, wage progression and work-life balance remain central to the discussions. All issues play into one another and can change based on demand priorities. Each automaker has its own unique issues, but overall the companies want to avoid fixed costs and what they’ve called “uncompetitive practices” such as traditional pensions. The union, in contrast, is attempting to regain benefits lost during past talks and secure significant increases to pay and other benefits, while retaining platinum health care for members. In the end, it comes down to money, and how much a deal will cost the companies. Wall Street is currently expecting record costs to come from a settlement, though still below the $6 billion to $8 billion in demands the union would like, according to Wells Fargo. Here’s a general overview of where the union and companies stand on key issues. Union leaders have been highly transparent during collective bargaining this year with the automakers. However, they’ve largely been quiet on any potential for compromise around a demand of 40% wage increases over four and a half years. Media reports indicate the union has adjusted that demand to the mid-30% range. UAW President Shawn Fain last week said the union has not made an offer below 30%. The automakers have countered with wage increases of around 20% over the length of the contract — what would still be a record — to a top wage of more than $39 per hour for a majority of workers. Sources familiar with the talks say if the companies do increase hourly wages beyond that 20% level, they’re likely to lower other benefits or reduce jobs in the future to try to make up the difference. A Ford source said the company’s current proposals would offer entry-level employees starting salaries of about $60,000, potentially increasing to $100,000 or more during the life of the deal. That includes base pay, expected overtime, profit-sharing and other cash bonuses. Under GM’s latest proposal, President Mark Reuss said about 85% of current represented employees would earn a base wage of about $82,000 a year. That’s compared with the average median household income of $51,821 in nine areas where GM has major assembly plants, he said. Wage tiers — putting autoworkers into distinct pay ranges or classifications — is a tricky, moving target. The companies and union have defined tiers differently during past negotiations as well as during the talks this year. Tiers can signify the following scenarios: workers doing the same job for different pay and benefits; similar but different job responsibilities; or differences between workers at assembly and components plants, depending on the talks. The UAW has called broadly for “equal pay for equal work.” It’s a cornerstone of the group’s platform, while automakers have historically argued for pay to be based on seniority, job classification and responsibilities. So-called tiers were established in 2007 as a concession by the union to allow lower wages and benefits for workers hired after the contracts were ratified that year — what became known as a second tier. The starting pay of these workers was roughly half that of the incumbent workers, and they would not be eligible for the same active health-care benefits, pensions or retiree health-care coverage. The union has won some similar benefits back for newer workers compared to veteran, or “legacy” ones, but there remains different classifications of workers and pay tiers that amount to “in-progression” wages, in which a worker earns more the longer they’re employed. For this year, the automakers have largely proposed cutting an existing eight-year pay progression in half and eliminating some pay discrepancies between workers who do similar jobs such as parts and components. The union would like to eliminate the in-progression pay structure entirely and have workers across the contract earning the same wage (after a 90-day adjustment period) including temporary, or supplemental, workers. One source familiar with the talks said there’s a “philosophical difference” between the sides. Ford, which utilizes the fewest temporary workers, has agreed to move all current temps with 90 days of work to full-time employees. The UAW suspended cost-of-living adjustments in 2009, as the companies attempted to cut costs. COLA helps employees maintain the value of their compensation against inflation. The union now wants to reinstate COLA, especially following a period of decades-high inflation. But the automakers, in general, have proposed either lump-sum payments or suggested utilizing calculations based on inflation levels that the union argues wouldn’t be sufficient to offset increased costs. Automakers have further argued that profit-sharing payments that have traditionally been based on North American profits of the companies have assisted in offsetting inflation. The companies are attempting to change or lower profit-sharing payments to offset other increased costs, while the union would like an enhanced formula. The UAW previously outlined a calculation of providing $2 for every $1 million spent on share buybacks and increases to normal dividends. The union has proposed better work-life balance, including a potential 32-hour workweek for the pay of 40 hours. It has argued that salaried workers are allowed remote or hybrid work, giving them more time at home with their families. A shorter workweek has been a non-starter for the automakers, which have countered with additional vacation time, added holiday pay such as for Juneteenth and two-week paternal leave, in some cases. For the UAW, product commitments equal jobs, meaning more members for the union. UAW leaders are specifically concerned with vehicle production commitments at Stellantis, which has proposed closing, selling or consolidating 18 facilities. The locations included its North American headquarters, 10 parts and distribution centers and three manufacturing components facilities (two of which have already been fully or partially decommissioned). A source familiar with the talks said GM has committed product to all of its facilities, following three closures four years ago. The UAW has demanded a “significant” increase in pay for retired workers. The union last week said the companies had rejected all such increases. However, GM CEO Mary Barra said the automaker included in its offer a lump-sum cash payment of $500 for retirees. A Ford source said the company’s current offer includes a health-care retirement bonus program with lump sums of either $50,000 or $35,000, upon retirement, based on seniority, for newer workers. Automakers also have pushed back on returning to traditional pensions in lieu of 401(k) plans. A proposal last week by Ford included a 6.4% contribution from the company and $1 per hour for every hour worked, with a previous cap removed, according to a company source. GM also offered an unconditional 6.4% company 401(k) contribution for employees who are not eligible for pensions.",CNBC
Drew Richardson,Saudi crown prince says he will keep ‘sportswashing’ as criticism grows,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman embraced accusations of “sportswashing” to rehabilitate the country’s image, as the kingdom beefs up its spending and influence in the major international sports of golf and soccer. “Well, if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by way of 1%, I will continue doing sportswashing,” he said during an interview with Fox News that aired Wednesday night. “I don’t care ... I’m aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we’re going to get that one and a half percent,” the crown prince said. Critics have long said that Saudi Arabia’s government is using sports investments to gain political influence around the world, as well as to mend the kingdom’s tarnished reputation from human rights abuses like the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The practice has been dubbed sportswashing. The kingdom has ramped up investments in sports in recent years, taking stakes in Saudi soccer clubs and recruiting top players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar from Europe to Saudi Arabia with deals reportedly as high as $175 million. It also lured pro golfers like Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau away from the PGA Tour to its rival LIV Golf with massive paydays — before the organizations ultimately agreed to merge. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), an entity controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed, has backed Saudi soccer clubs and LIV Golf. PIF has a range of investments in areas from electronic vehicles to entertainment. The fund is worth over $700 billion, up from $528 billion in 2021, Reuters reported earlier Thursday. The LIV Golf merger with the PGA Tour has faced widespread scrutiny. Critics say the deal, announced in June, is in part an attempt to rehabilitate Saudi Arabia’s image. The deal could also pose a threat to national security, lawmakers have said. U.S. officials have found that Saudi Arabia has ties to the 9/11 attacks, though the Saudi government has denied involvement. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals, and the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was born in the country. Key U.S. lawmakers have criticized the pending golf merger as an attempt by the kingdom to distract from its human rights record. Saudi Arabia is “a regime that has killed journalists, jailed and tortured dissidents, fostered the war in Yemen, and supported other terrorist activities, including 9/11. It’s called sportswashing,” Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Investigations Subcommittee chair Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said during a panel hearing in July examining the deal. PGA Tour officials Jimmy Dunne and Ron Price said during that hearing that the golf organization faced an existential threat from LIV before the proposed merger. Prior to the deal, LIV Golf sued the PGA Tour for alleged anticompetitive practices, which prompted the PGA Tour to countersue, saying LIV Golf was stifling competition. “We are in a situation where we faced a real threat ... you could go elsewhere for $1 billion, $3 billion, maybe $50 billion,” Price said at the time. “We could do it, but if we went down that path, we would end up giving up total control.” Earlier this month, the Senate subcommittee held a second hearing on the LIV Golf and PGA Tour merger, where one witness said the agreement was not about business. “At its core, then, this is not a business deal,” said Benjamin Freeman, director of the Democratizing Foreign Policy Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. “This is an influence operation. It’s meant to shape U.S. public opinion and U.S. foreign policy.” — CNBC’s Lillian Rizzo and Chelsey Cox contributed to this report",CNBC
Drew Richardson,WWE’s ‘SmackDown’ to return to NBCUniversal’s USA Network in 2024,"In this article WWE’s “Friday Night SmackDown” will return to USA Network in October 2024 as part of a five-year domestic media rights partnership between TKO Group Holdings and NBCUniversal , WWE said Thursday. Shares of TKO dropped more than 14% following the announcement. The deal comes out to an average of $287 million per year, a total value of over $1.4 billion, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. WWE does not expect to reach a rights agreement for its flagship show “Raw” until next year. “SmackDown” has been on Fox since October 2019, with a rights agreement for $205 million per year in a five-year deal. The new agreement is roughly a 40% increase. “SmackDown” last appeared on USA Network from 2016 to 2019. WWE is a component of TKO Group Holdings, which was created after a merger between WWE and Endeavor ’s UFC. TKO began trading on the NYSE last week. WWE will also produce four prime-time specials per year to air on NBC beginning in the 2024-2025 season. “It’s a privilege and thrill to continue NBCU’s decades-long partnership with WWE which has helped cement USA Network’s consistent position as the top-rated cable entertainment network in live viewership,” said Frances Berwick, chairman of NBCUniversal Entertainment. “With Friday nights on USA, primetime specials on NBC, and the WWE hub on Peacock, we’ll continue to use the power of our portfolio to super-serve this passionate fanbase.” Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.",CNBC
Diana Olick,"Home sales stick near recent lows in August, but prices continue to climb","Sales of previously owned homes fell 0.7% in August from July to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 4.04 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were down 15.3% from August of last year. This read is based on closings for contracts likely signed in June and July, when the average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage was in the high 6% range. It moved over 7% toward the end of July and stayed there, hitting affordability hard. “Home sales have been stable for several months, neither rising nor falling in any meaningful way,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the NAR, in a release. “Mortgage rate changes will have a big impact over the short run, while job gains will have a steady, positive impact over the long run.” It is not, however, just higher rates hitting potential buyers. They are also not finding much on the market. There were just 1.1 million units for sale at the end of August, down 0.9% for the month and down just more than 14% year over year. Inventory is now at a 3.3-month supply. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller. Tight supply has turned prices decidedly higher again. The median price of a home sold in August was $407,100, up 3.9% from a year ago and the highest reported price for the month of August. Yun said supply needs to double to moderate these price gains. “Homeowners are in fine shape. It’s Realtors and mortgage brokers that are challenged, and renters are frustrated,” said Yun. Sales continue to be weakest on the lower end of the market, where there is the least supply. While sales were down across all price points, they were nearly flat for homes priced above $1 million, and in that range they were actually higher in both the South and the Midwest. “Already, rising homebuying costs and falling rents have tipped the monthly rent vs. buy tradeoff in favor of renting in the overwhelming majority of the 50 largest metropolitan areas,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a release. “This is true not only in tech hubs like Austin and San Francisco, but also affordable markets like Columbus, Ohio.” ",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,U.S. will again offer free at-home Covid tests starting Monday,"The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will resume offering free at-home Covid tests to American households Monday as the virus gains a stronger foothold nationwide.  Americans will soon be able to use COVIDtests.gov to request four free tests, the administration said in a release.  The government had offered free test kits through that website since January 2022, but the site stopped taking orders June 1 of this year to conserve supplies of the tests.  The government is relaunching the program in time for the fall and winter when the virus typically spreads at higher levels. Covid hospitalizations have already increased for eight straight weeks — an uptick primarily driven by newer strains of the virus. But the Biden administration noted that the at-home tests set to be delivered will detect currently circulating Covid variants. The kits are intended for use through the end of 2023 and will come with instructions for how people can verify if a test’s expiration date has been extended, the administration added. Testing is a critical tool for protection as Covid infections climb again. But lab PCR tests — the traditional method of detecting Covid — have become more expensive and less accessible for some Americans since the U.S. government ended the public health emergency in May.  The end of that declaration also changed how public and private insurers cover at-home tests, potentially leaving some people unable to get those tests for free through their plans. But certain local health clinics and community sites still offer at-home tests to the public at no cost.  Also on Wednesday, the Biden administration said it will provide $600 million to strengthen manufacturing capacity at 12 Covid test manufacturers across the country. The administration expects to secure about 200 million tests from those companies.  “These critical investments will strengthen our nation’s production levels of domestic at-home COVID-19 rapid tests and help mitigate the spread of the virus,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement.",CNBC
Lillian Rizzo,"Hollywood studios, writers near agreement to end strike, hope to finalize deal Thursday, sources say","Writers and producers are near an agreement to end the Writers Guild of America strike after meeting face-to-face on Wednesday, people close to the negotiations told CNBC’s David Faber on Wednesday. The two sides met and hope to finalize a deal Thursday, the sources said. While optimistic, the people told Faber, however, that if a deal is not reached the strike could last through the end of the year. On Wednesday evening, the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers released a joint statement that the two groups met for bargaining and would negotiate again on Thursday. The sides are set to reconvene at 9 a.m. PT on Thursday, Faber reported. Representatives for the organizations didn’t respond to requests for further comment. WGA members have been on strike for more than 100 days — with actors joining the picket line in July — leaving Hollywood production of TV shows and movies at a standstill. Production has been halted for several high-profile shows and films, including Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” Disney and Marvel’s “Blade,” and Paramount’s “Evil.” Earlier in the week, the writers’ union said it would resume negotiations with the studios. This appears to be the closest the two sides have come to a resolution since the more than 11,000 film and TV writers went on strike beginning May 2. They have argued their compensation doesn’t match the revenue that’s been generated during the streaming era. Beyond higher compensation, the WGA has been pushing for new rules that would require studios to staff TV shows with a certain number of writers for a certain period. The writers are also seeking compensation throughout the process of preproduction, production and postproduction. As of now, writers are often expected to provide revisions or come up with new material without being paid. In late August, the AMPTP went public with its latest proposal to the WGA at the time and tensions between the two groups appeared to remain high. Discussions between the studios and writers have included sit-down conversations with top media brass, including Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Disney’s Bob Iger, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and NBCUniversal film head Donna Langley. The strikes have weighed on these media companies as they grapple with making streaming profitable and getting people back in theaters. Warner Bros. Discovery — the owner of a TV and film studio, as well as the largest portfolio of pay TV networks — warned investors of the effects of the strikes earlier this month when it adjusted its earnings expectations. The company said it now expects that its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will take a hit of $300 million to $500 million, with a full-year range of $10.5 billion to $11 billion. At a conference earlier this month, Zaslav called for an end to the writers and actors strikes. “We need to do everything we can to get people back to work,” Zaslav said at the investors’ conference. “We really have to focus as an industry, and we are, on trying to get this resolved in a way that’s really fair.” Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.

Amelia Lucas,Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants beats earnings estimates,"In this article Darden Restaurants on Thursday reported earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations for its first quarter as the owner of Ruth’s Chris Steak House. But some consumers are pulling back on their restaurant spending. Same-store sales for Darden’s fine dining segment fell more than expected as consumers earning at least $125,000 dined out less often. Casual dining chains Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse saw customers order fewer alcoholic drinks and choose cheaper entrees. “Overall, we think the consumer continues to be resilient, but they seem to be a little bit more selective,” CEO Rick Cardenas told analysts on the company’s conference call. Shares of the company rose less than 1% in morning trading. Here’s what the company reported for the quarter ended Aug. 27 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Darden reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $194.5 million, or $1.59 per share, up from $193 million, or $1.56 per share, a year earlier. Excluding its acquisition of Ruth’s Chris, integration costs related to the deal and other items, the restaurant company earned $1.78 per share from continuing operations. Net sales rose 11.6% to $2.73 billion, fueled by menu prices that were about 6% higher than the year-ago period. Darden’s same-store sales, excluding those of Ruth’s Chris, rose 5% in the quarter. The company won’t include Ruth’s Chris in its same-store sales results until it has owned the steakhouse chain for 16 months. The $715 million acquisition was completed in mid-June. Cardenas said that Darden is now expecting to “realize more synergies” than previously expected from the acquisition. About $10 million of the $35 million in cost-savings will be reinvested into the business. LongHorn Steakhouse was the top performer in Darden’s portfolio this quarter. The chain reported same-store sales growth of 8.1%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 6.1%. Olive Garden, which accounts for roughly 45% of Darden’s revenue, reported same-store sales growth of 6.1%, meeting expectations. The Italian-inspired chain will bring back its popular Never Ending Pasta Bowl, starting Monday. Its loyalty members were able to use the promotion this week. But Darden executives said that they won’t lean into deep discounts to draw customers to restaurants. Darden’s fine dining restaurants saw same-store sales shrink 2.8%, wider than expectations of a 1.8% decline. The segment includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V’s, but its same-store sales metric doesn’t yet include Ruth’s Chris. Darden also reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2024. The company is forecasting net sales of $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, same-store sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.55 to $8.85.",CNBC
Gabrielle Fonrouge,"Adidas CEO says Kanye West didn’t mean antisemitic remarks, isn’t a bad person","In this article Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden defended Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, and said the rapper didn’t mean it when he made a series of antisemitic remarks. In a conversation on philanthropist Nicolai Tangen’s podcast “In Good Company,” Gulden was asked about the retailer’s partnership with Ye and how its Yeezy collaboration fell apart.  “He did some statements, which wasn’t that good and that caused Adi to break the contract and withdraw the product,” Gulden said on the program, which aired Sept. 12.  “Very unfortunate because I don’t think he meant what he said and I don’t think he’s a bad person — it just came across that way,” he added. Last fall, the German sneaker giant announced it was ending its highly lucrative partnership with Ye and pulling Yeezy products from its shelves after he made a series of widely criticized antisemitic remarks.  “I’m a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I’m going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE,” Ye wrote in a since deleted post on Oct. 9. Following widespread public outcry, Adidas announced it had ended its relationship with Ye, stopped production of Yeezy-branded products and ended all payments to Ye and his companies.  Foot Locker and Gap soon followed suit and announced they would pull Yeezy products from their stores. Gulden, who was named CEO of Adidas about a month after the scandal unfolded, called the company’s breakup with Ye “very sad” because it meant that the retailer “lost that business,” which he described as one of the most successful collaborations in history.  “You know when you work with third parties, that could happen and you know it’s part of the game. That can happen with an athlete, it can happen with an entertainer, so it’s part of the business,” said Gulden.  Earlier in the show, Gulden called Ye “one of the most creative people in the world,” both in terms of music and street culture.  Despite the public comments from its chief executive, an Adidas spokesperson told CNBC that the company’s position on Ye “has not changed.” Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden defended Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, and said the rapper didn’t mean it when he made a series of antisemitic remarks. “Ending the partnership was appropriate,” the spokesperson said.",CNBC
John Rosevear,"GM and Stellantis just laid off more than 2,000 workers because of UAW strike","In this article General Motors and Stellantis said they have laid off additional workers because of consequences related to the United Auto Workers strike. GM said in a statement Wednesday that it has halted production at its assembly plant in Fairfax, Kansas, because of a “shortage of critical stampings” that would have been supplied by its factory in Wentzville, Missouri, where workers went on strike last week. About 2,000 workers are affected. Earlier Wednesday, Stellantis said it is laying off about 370 employees at three parts factories in Ohio and Indiana immediately due to “storage constraints,” also related to the strike. The plants make parts for Jeep vehicles built at the automaker’s Toledo Assembly Complex, where workers are also on strike. UAW-represented workers walked out of the Wentzville and Toledo assembly plants, as well as a Ford Motor factory in Wayne, Michigan, near Detroit, on Sep. 15, after the three automakers failed to reach a deal on a new contract with the union. GM’s Fairfax Assembly plant builds the Chevrolet Malibu sedan and Cadillac XT4 crossover. GM said that because of the strike, the 2,000 workers laid off from Fairfax will not be eligible for the supplemental unemployment benefits that its laid-off employees would normally receive. “We have said repeatedly that nobody wins in a strike,” GM said in a statement. “What happened to our Fairfax team members is a clear and immediate demonstration of that fact. We will continue to bargain in good faith with the union to reach an agreement as quickly as possible.” Nearly 13,000 GM, Ford and Stellantis workers are on strike at the Wentzville, Toledo and Wayne plants. UAW President Shawn Fain said the union would announce more strikes Friday unless there is “serious progress” in negotiations.",CNBC
Annika Kim Constantino,Covid shot rollout off to a bumpy start as some patients see insurance delays,"In this article The rollout of a new round of Covid vaccines in the U.S. is off to a bumpy start as some patients report delays in health insurance coverage for the shots.  Private insurance plans and government payers such as Medicare are required to cover the new jabs from Pfizer and Moderna , which became available late last week. U.S. regulators have recommended all Americans ages 6 months and up get the new round of vaccines.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, some private health-care providers and CVS confirmed the temporary delays in coverage and emphasized that Americans can access Covid vaccines at no cost through insurance plans. They said the reason for the delays is that some insurers are still working to update their plans to include the new vaccines. Dozens of posts on social media in recent days show some patients were charged anywhere between $125 and $190 for a shot at pharmacies. Others were told their insurance plans aren’t covering the new vaccines yet.  The reports are fueling confusion among insured patients about whether they can still access Covid shots for free – even after public health officials have reassured them that they can — just as cases tick up across the country. It also comes after a huge shift in how Covid vaccines are covered in the U.S. The government is moving shots to the commercial market, which means manufacturers will sell their new jabs directly to health-care providers at more than $120 per dose. Previously, the federal government purchased Covid vaccines directly from manufacturers at a discount to distribute to all Americans for free. A CMS spokesperson said the agency is “aware that some consumers have had difficulty accessing COVID-19 vaccines, including experiencing unexpected insurance coverage denials at the point of service.” CMS has been in “close contact with the plans about these transitions for months,” and is reaching out again to ensure that their systems are “up-to-date and prepared to meet their obligations to provide coverage of Covid-19 vaccines for participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees,” according to the spokesperson.  A spokesperson for CVS told CNBC that some payers “are still updating their systems and may not yet be set up to cover the updated COVID-19 vaccines.” They added that the company’s pharmacy teams can help patients schedule a vaccine appointment for a later date if their coverage is denied.  Sarah Lindsey, an owner of a Florida-based jewelry store, called on her own insurer to add the new Covid shots to its formulary.  “Any insured member trying to get it at a pharmacy is being told it’s not approved and will cost $155. There’s no excuse for this,” she wrote Monday in a post on X, formerly Twitter, tagging Florida Blue, a local Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer.  A spokesperson for Florida Blue said a “small percentage” of patients experienced issues with coverage, but the insurer does cover the shots for most beneficiaries at no cost. Any insured patients who were charged for a Covid shot should contact their pharmacy for reimbursement or file a claim with Florida Blue. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for health-care provider Elevance Health urged pharmacies to resubmit Covid vaccine claims “so they can be processed at a $0 copay.” They added that they expect the delays in coverage to be resolved quickly. The coverage missteps come amid concerns that a mix of pandemic fatigue, the belief that Covid is “over” and confusion over personal risk levels will hinder the uptake of the new vaccines, which are designed to target the omicron subvariant XBB.1.5.  Only 17% of the U.S. population — around 56 million people — have received Pfizer’s and Moderna’s bivalent Covid boosters since they were approved last September, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Stefan Sykes,Anheuser-Busch to stop cutting off Clydesdale horse tails after backlash,"In this article Anheuser-Busch InBev said it will no longer cut the tails of the iconic Clydesdale horses used in its signature Budweiser commercials and at events, following extended backlash from animal rights groups. The beverage maker, which has seen sales suffer after criticism of its partnership with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney, debuted its horse-drawn beer wagon nearly a century ago to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition of beer. The Clydesdale horses instantly became a hit with audiences and Anheuser-Busch has since used them in hundreds of appearances across the country each year for parades, television commercials and Super Bowl events. However, the practice known as “docking,” which can involve cutting through a horse’s tailbone, has come under scrutiny. Anheuser-Busch on Wednesday said it has stopped cutting off tails. “The practice of equine tail docking was discontinued earlier this year,” a spokesperson for the company said. “The safety and well-being of our beloved Clydesdales is our top priority.” Tailbone amputation for cosmetic reasons is illegal in 10 states and multiple countries. The American Veterinary Medical Association has also condemned it. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said an investigation it conducted found Budweiser horses had their tails docked for cosmetic reasons, and it decried the practice as “crude mutilation.” PETA said it found some representatives for Anheuser-Busch have said they trimmed the hairs on the tails rather than cut them off. Earlier this month, an international coalition of animal protection organizations, including PETA, sent a letter to Anheuser-Busch urging the beer maker to end the practice. PETA even purchased stock in the company to voice concerns at shareholder meetings, in addition to protests and other actions the group took. In a statement to CNBC, PETA said it’s celebrating the beer maker’s decision to stop cutting horse tails by “cracking open some cold ones.” In addition to saying it would stop the practice, the company also announced a new partnership with American Humane, the world’s largest certifier of animal welfare practices.",CNBC
Michael Wayland,"GM executive slams UAW over ‘flow of misinformation,’ rhetoric during strike","In this article DETROIT – As the United Auto Workers union enters day six of targeted strikes against the Detroit automakers, General Motors President Mark Reuss is criticizing union leadership for its rhetoric and “flow of misinformation” during the ongoing contract negotiations. Reuss, in an editorial, focused on the union’s public bashing of the company and elements of GM’s “record” contract proposal last week that included 20% pay raises and improved time off, bonuses and other benefits over the four-year term of the deal. “As the past has clearly shown, nobody wins in a strike,” Reuss said in a Wednesday column in the Detroit Free Press. “We have delivered a record offer. That is a fact. It rightly rewards our team members, while positioning the company for success in the future. Often in these situations, the clouds of rhetoric can obscure reality.” The UAW hasn’t responded to the op-ed, as of Wednesday morning. GM’s last offer was made Sept. 14, ahead of the union initiating a “Stand Up Strike” at one assembly plant each for GM, Ford Motor and Stellantis. UAW President Shawn Fain said Monday the strikes will expand at noon Friday unless “serious progress” is made in negotiations. Currently on strike are roughly 12,700 UAW workers from GM’s midsize truck and full-size van plant in Wentzville, Missouri; Ford’s Ranger midsize pickup and Bronco SUV plant in Wayne, Michigan; and Stellantis’ Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator plant in Toledo, Ohio. Reuss said GM’s offer, which the union countered, recognizes “the many contributions our represented team members make to our company — past, present and future.” Under the deal, Reuss said about 85% of current represented employees would earn a base wage of approximately $82,000 a year. That’s compared with the average median household income in nine areas where GM has major assembly plants of $51,821, he said. GM’s current proposal is estimated to cost between $700 million and $1.2 billion over the life of the deal, Wells Fargo’s Colin Langan said in a Sept. 15 investor note. If GM gave in to all the union’s demands, it would cost the company between $6 billion and $8 billion under the deal, Langan said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “There’s a long way to go. We’re talking about fixed-costs, too. That’s the real pain point for the automakers,” Langan said, calling them “material numbers” for the companies. Key demands from the union have included 40% hourly pay increases; a reduced, 32-hour workweek; a shift back to traditional pensions; the elimination of compensation tiers; and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments. Other items on the table include enhanced retiree benefits and better vacation and family leave benefits. Reuss said Wednesday that the union’s full demands would be “untenable,” or unsustainable, for the company. “If we don’t continue to invest, we will lose ground — quickly. Our competitors across the country and around the world, most of whom are non-union, will waste no time seizing the opportunity we would be handing them,” he said. Reuss’ comments are the latest by automotive executives as the UAW takes a strategically aggressive approach during the talks, showing little leeway in its demands. Late Monday, Ford released a lengthy statement fact-checking comments made by Fain, including auto worker wages, company profits and stock buybacks. It followed Ford CEO Jim Farley last week saying the company would have “gone bankrupt by now” under the union’s current proposals. He’s also criticized Fain for his approach to bargaining. “We’ve never seen anything like this; it’s frustrating,” Farley told CNBC’s Phil LeBeau last week ahead of the strikes. “I don’t know what Shawn Fain is doing, but he’s not negotiating this contract with us, as it expires.”",CNBC
Stefan Sykes,Philip Morris weighs options for pharmaceuticals unit to boost health care,"In this article Philip Morris International is considering selling off a stake in its largest pharmaceuticals unit. The tobacco company, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, made inroads into the health care and wellness space in 2021 with the acquisition of Vectura, a U.K.-based pharmaceutical company that makes inhaled medicines and inhaler devices. But more recently, the division has struggled, and Philip Morris has had talks with Deutsche Bank on a range of options to try to grow its wellness and health-care division, The Wall Street Journal first reported. The company has been looking for a new partner to help boost Vectura, and it’s contemplating different options including a licensing or royalties deal, a commercial partnership or a sale of a majority or minority stake in the business. In recent years, Philip Morris has also acquired Fertin Pharma, a nicotine gum maker, and OtiTopic, a respiratory drugmaker. The three deals, which together totaled more than $2 billion, were part of the company’s broader, long-term pivot toward developing smoke-free products and medicines aimed at treating respiratory diseases commonly associated with cigarette smoking. The acquisitions, however, triggered backlash from the public health sector. In the second quarter of this year, the company took a $680 million impairment charge related to its wellness and health-care division. At the time of the Vectura deal, Philip Morris said the acquisition would grow its “Beyond Nicotine” business and help the division achieve its goal of generating at least $1 billion in net revenues from these products by 2025. Following the setbacks, Philip Morris walked back on that goal and said it would begin reducing its investments in the division. The company, in its Q2 earnings call, said it nevertheless will “remain committed to developing” its wellness and health-care business and it plans to “accelerate Vectura’s growth and will be exploring potential partnerships.” The news comes as the tobacco company continues to face resistance from public health groups. This week, Philip Morris had its CEO removed from the lineup at the Concordia Annual Summit, a side event to the United Nations General Assembly meeting held in New York every September, after health experts refused to speak at the conference in protest against his appearance. Concordia also rescinded Philip Morris’ membership in the conference effective immediately.",CNBC
Melissa Repko,"Walmart opens pet center with veterinary care and grooming, signaling bigger ambitions","In this article Walmart is opening a dedicated pet services center, signaling it wants to be a place that customers turn to for veterinarian visits and dog grooming appointments along with grocery runs. On Wednesday, the retailer is opening a first-of-its-kind center in Dallas, Georgia, a suburb about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta. With the move, the nation’s biggest grocer is building on its traditional pet business. It has sold pet items for decades, including Ol’ Roy, its private label dog food that’s named after Walmart founder Sam Walton’s English setter. Yet with the new facility, Walmart will dip its toe into a more lucrative part of the pet industry: health care and other services. The company already stocks top pet medications at its Walmart pharmacies. Walmart’s pet services center will have its own dedicated entrance next to a store. It will carry the Walmart name, but employees of vet care and pet product company PetIQ will staff it. PetIQ has rented space for vet clinics inside more than 65 Walmart stores, after opening its first one in 2016. The Georgia location will serve as a pilot, but Walmart plans to open more locations, said Kaitlyn Shadiow, vice president of merchandising for pets for Walmart U.S. She declined to say how many pet shops it may ultimately have but said Walmart plans to open more next year, if not sooner. “We know pet services is an important need for our customers and we want to be able to provide that all in one place,” she said. She cited a Morgan Stanley study that found that about 40% of total pet industry revenue is driven by services. As Americans treat their dogs, cats and other animals like family members, more retailers have chased the expanding pool of dollars consumers are spending on vet bills or fashion-forward leashes or other accessories. Those include Kohl’s , which has started to devote space to pet items in some stores, and Lowe’s , which announced it is expanding mini Petco Health and Wellness shops and mobile vet services to more stores after testing the concept. Consumers in the U.S. spent $136.8 billion on pets last year, according to industry group American Pet Products Association. That huge market includes a long list of expenses, such as food and treats, boarding, dog walking and veterinary care. After pet food and treats, vet care and products are the second-biggest driver of the industry — tallying up to $35.9 billion last year, according to APPA. As the Covid-induced pet boom recedes and consumers buy fewer pet toys and supplies, Chewy and Petco have both looked to pet health care to drive their futures — especially as those pandemic pups and other pets grow up. Retailers consider the pet space, much like items for kids, an attractive area because consumers are usually still willing to spend when their budgets are tight or the economy hits a rough patch, said Anna Andreeva, an analyst for Needham & Company who covers consumer and e-commerce companies including pet specialty retailers. Yet in the past few months, she said, cracks have emerged in that theory. Petco, Chewy and General Mills , the maker of dog food Blue Buffalo, have warned that some pet owners are becoming more price-sensitive and even trading down to cheaper pet food as they deal with inflation. For Walmart, that cost-conscious mentality could bring a competitive advantage — much like the one its grocery business has enjoyed over the last year due to its low-price reputation. At the pet services center, Walmart will offer a range of vet and grooming services, including wellness exams, nail trims, teeth cleaning, hair cuts and more. The services range in price, from $15 nail trims to $25 rabies shots to $97 for a vital package. That visit includes a physical exam, several vaccines and a parasite screening. The pet store will provide vet services for dogs and cats. Grooming is available for dogs. Walmart said it has no plans now to add other animals. Along with opening the center, Walmart started rolling out a new offering this week that can automate customers’ frequent orders, including pet food and supplies. The subscription-based approach, which requires no fee, rips a page from the playbook of direct-to-consumer pet specialty retailer, Chewy. The company has grown its business with the help of Autoship, which allows customers who set up repeat deliveries of items to get a discount. The company’s membership program, Walmart+, has also gotten some pet-related perks, including a free one-year membership to pet telehealth service Pawp. Yet as it moves further into the pet space, Walmart will have to prove it can gain traction in a new business. The company has made a similar push to offer lower-priced doctor, dentist and therapy appointments to people through Walmart Health. It opened its first health clinic in 2019 in the same store in Dallas, Georgia, where it will now test pet services. The clinics speak to the challenge of entering a new business. Walmart’s health clinics have opened slowly, and the expansion effort has been complicated by frequent turnover of top leadership. By the end of 2023, Walmart expects to have a total of 48 health centers in Georgia, Arkansas, Illinois, Texas and Florida — only about 1% of Walmart’s more than 4,500 U.S. locations. With the proximity of Walmart’s pet service center to its store, the retailer will try to nudge customers to other purchases, as well. The pet center will have a small amount of retail space, where Walmart initially plans to sell its own private label pet brands. And while only service pets are allowed inside Walmart stores, customers who drop off a pet for a vet visit or grooming service can leave their dog at the kennel overseen by PetIQ employees while they swing into the store for groceries and other items, Shadiow said.",CNBC
