Brooke DiPalma,"How Lululemon parlayed yoga pants into an entry to the S&P 500
The yogi brand survived several scandals to become an athleisure powerhouse.","Lululemon is finally aligning with Wall Street.The athleisure retail company officially joined the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index on Wednesday, replacing game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI), which recently finalized its merger with Microsoft (MSFT).The Canadian company weathered a series of storms in the mid-2010s but grew out of its yogi-heavy appeal into a cross-generational, multisport brand. In the past year, its stock has risen nearly 40%, while it recently beat estimates on earnings and revenue.Last quarter, its net revenue increased 18% compared to a year ago, while internet sales growth jumped 15%.""From a long-term perspective, this is a sustainable growth story,"" Bernstein senior analyst Aneesha Sherman told Yahoo Finance over the phone.This run-up is a long time coming.The company, which first started making its signature legging in the late 90s, went public back in 2007. By 2013, its share price had roughly quadrupled, as its revenue flew from $275 million to over $1.3 billion. Then, it hit choppy waters.In March 2013, Lululemon recalled 17% of its black yoga pants for being too sheer, which cost it roughly $60 million in lost sales, reported the New York Times. Its CEO Christine Day resigned that June, and later told Fortune she left due to conflicting views with its founder Chip Wilson. Day declined to comment to Yahoo Finance.That November, Wilson went on Bloomberg TV and said issues with his company's leggings was because ""Some women’s bodies don’t work for the pants."" He stepped down from the board a month later amid uproar from customers; Lululemon's share price dropped by roughly a quarter in 2014.Day's successor, Laurent Potdevin, then resigned in 2018, which the company said was due to him falling short of expectations for employees when it comes to integrity and respect. Among the issues was a rumored relationship with a female designer at the company.Amid the noise, Lululemon marched on, pushing more into menswear in 2014 and investing in digital sales. In August 2018, Calvin McDonald took the helm as CEO and carried forward the momentum as the company moved its appeal beyond yoga.Story continues""Since about 2018, it's just been incredibly successful,"" David Swartz, Morningstar senior equity analyst, told Yahoo Finance over the phone. ""It's defied all the pressure on retailers, especially apparel retailers in that time.""<img alt=""CORTE MADERA, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 02: A customer enters a Lululemon store on June 02, 2023 in Corte Madera, California.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Leggings to work? It's the new normal.As Lululemon began its turnaround, athleisure wear kept growing in popularity. In 2017, imports of stretchy pants outpaced those of jeans, according to the US Census Bureau. The company capitalized on the trend at the right time, with a ""premium price point with premium quality that worked with consumers,"" said Sherman.Since then, other brands like On Running (ONON) and Hoka have been cashing in on the shift. On Running co-CEO Martin Hoffmann told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Retail Conference that ""the trend for casualization is not over,"" but still growing.Multiple generations are buying in, a key growth driver for Lululemon.The company has the ability to appeal to high schoolers alongside its core customer base of 35- to 55-year-olds, Sherman said. Its leggings are the No. 1 trend among upper-income teens, per Piper Sandler's latest semiannual Gen Z survey.And the previous generation of teens that first grew up with athleisure are entering the workplace. It's now ""perfectly normal"" to wear leggings ""to school, work, and church, and all sorts of [places],"" Swartz said, far different than years ago when such attire would be similar to wearing pajamas to your job.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15408852/embed?auto=1></iframe>In the past few years, Lululemon has been able to ride ""three waves of growth,"" which include e-commerce, athleisure wear booming during COVID lockdowns, and pent-up demand for high-quality casual apparel, Sherman said.Lululemon's digital sales jumped 27% in fiscal year 2017, hitting a peak jumping 101% year over year in fiscal year 2020. More recently, non-athletic wear like belt bags and men's casual pants are gaining momentum, though it's too early to tell if Lululemon can become a universal brand like Nike or Adidas.Last year, Lululemon released its plans to double its 2021 revenue of $6.25 billion to $12.5 billion by 2026. Besides expanding its product lines, the company aims to quadruple its international revenue and make China its No. 2 market. The move can unlock wholesale opportunities in the country as well, said Sherman.It also launched its ""Play"" categories in 2022, which includes apparel for golf, tennis, and hiking.Growth comes with risks, though. Sherman calls the brand's expansion into footwear last year a mistake, as it requires extensive development costs while diluting profit margins. In her eyes, the brand could have pursued other untapped areas like kids. Its $500 million acquisition of fitness startup Mirror in June 2020 also did not pan out.Though the macroeconomic environment is volatile, Lululemon has been able to sell its inventory without taking a discount strategy, McDonald said at Goldman Sachs' Retail Conference earlier this year.It's undeniable, though: People are increasingly looking for deals as inflation remains sticky and savings dwindle.""I don't think they [can] escape [consumers looking for discounts],"" said Sherman, ""but I think it's probably a little bit more defensive because of the higher-income consumer segment.""—Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Ronda Lee,Student loan repayments will have a 'limited' impact on the economy: NY Fed,"Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are predicting that student loan repayments won't pose a huge headwind for the economy based on a small survey of borrowers.The study released Wednesday found that the restart in loan payments would reduce borrowers' spending by $1.6 billion a month, or down 0.1 percentage point from August levels. Delinquency rates would also eventually return to pre-pandemic levels.""We expect the potential spillover to the broader economy to be limited, and we will continue to monitor developments in the coming months,"" the researchers wrote.The findings come as retailers, borrower advocates, and others worry about the potential ramifications of repayments after a 43-month pause.Read more: Worried about student loan repayments resuming? These programs could help<img alt=""A US flag flies above a building as students earning degrees at Pasadena City College participate in the graduation ceremony, June 14, 2019, in Pasadena, California. - With 45 million borrowers owing $1.5 trillion, the student debt crisis in the United States has exploded in recent years and has become a key electoral issue in the run-up to the 2020 presidential elections.

(ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)The study used the SCE Household Spending Survey that the New York Fed fields every four months. In the August 2023 edition, the researchers added special questions about student loan repayments. Of the 1,000 respondents, 225 had outstanding student loans and 151 of those indicated their federal student loans were previously paused, but will be entering repayment.Pandemic forbearance gave borrowers over $260 billion in waived payments that went to other spending and savings over the last three years, the study found. After the pause, borrowers on average expect to cut back their monthly spending by $56 from their monthly average they reported in August.That jibes with a September survey of 402 student loan borrowers from New York Life that found that 23% reported they would cut back on lifestyle expenditures. That also echoes concerns by a handful of retailers. Target and Walmart execs have recently noted they're keeping an eye on consumer behavior after payments resume.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/5993642/embed?auto=1></iframe>The New York Fed study also found that borrowers said there was a 22.6% probability they would miss a student loan payment, which the researchers noted was similar to the pre-pandemic delinquency rate of 23%. The New York Life survey found that a higher percentage of Americans with student loan debt — 27% — say they're not sure how they will be able to repay their loans in October.Story continuesThe Fed researchers said they expect missed and late payments to be a bigger issue for women, low-income borrowers, and those who didn’t get a degree but still have student loan debt.""We don't want to downplay the hardship,"" the researchers said in a press briefing on Wednesday.As for other debt payments, borrowers in the New York Fed survey reported a 11.8% increase in the likelihood of missing one of those payments because of student loan repayments. Many borrowers have greater debt obligations now than before the payment pause.More than half (53%) of borrowers got a new credit card, over a third (36%) took on an auto loan, and 15% now have a mortgage or personal loan, according to a recent TransUnion study.""These additional credit products mean additional monthly payments, the accumulation of which may pose added challenges for households attempting to reintegrate student loan payments into their monthly budget,"" said Liz Pagel, consumer lending business leader at TransUnion, in the study.<img alt=""Close up of a card payment being made betweem a man and a waiter in a cafe."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KVFr8c5myi65XvS74dt3Uw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY1OTtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ad612880-1fed-11ee-ba9e-3c8e69aabbe0 class=caas-img>Credit: Getty ImagesDespite the struggles that some borrowers reported, the researchers pointed out the overall impact would be curbed due to a number of factors.The on-ramp that the president announced this summer won't report missed or late payments to the credit reporting bureaus for 12 months, so borrowers' creditworthiness won't get dinged.The Biden administration has also canceled $127 billion in student loans for 3.6 million borrowers as a result of public service loan forgiveness, cancelation under income-driven repayment plans, and disability and borrower’s defense discharges.The researchers also found evidence that some borrowers resumed payments soon after the Supreme Court struck down the up to $20,000 in loan forgiveness in June. Daily deposits to the US Treasury from the Department of Education — the bulk of which are federal student loan payments — increased after the ruling. The researchers hypothesize that some of the expected reduction in spending has already occurred.<img alt=""(Credit: Federal Reserve Bank of New York)"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.Sb_uo9_bTZ2M9T_lq4.Vw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/5e0b2e70-6dea-11ee-bbdf-4716d377afe0 class=caas-img>(Credit: Federal Reserve Bank of New York)They also expect President Joe Biden’s new income-driven repayment plan will reduce monthly payments and waive unpaid interest for low-income student loan borrowers. The study estimated that 58% of borrowers will be enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan after the pause, compared with 50% pre-pandemic.Read more: How to apply for IDR forgivenessStill, there are headwinds on that front.To date, the majority of borrowers enrolled in the president's new plan are those that were automatically transferred from an older repayment plan. New enrollees to the new plan are relatively low. Additionally, borrowers have experienced problems trying to enroll in SAVE and reach out to loan servicers.Recently, a Student Debt Crisis Center surveyed found only 20% of respondents feel they have the information they need to prepare for the resumption of payments, and 27.5% have not received any recent communication from their loan servicer.""I know firsthand that the information borrowers receive from their loan servicers is sporadic at best and not always wholly accurate,"" said Sabrina Calazans, managing director of the SDCC, in a press statement. ""We hear from borrowers daily who are struggling to not only navigate the system, but to even know where to start.""Ronda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Finance and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.

Alexandra Canal,Netflix subscribers surge as company announces price hikes in some regions,"Netflix (NFLX) reported a surge in third quarter subscriber numbers of nearly 9 million and announced it will be raising prices in the US, UK, and France, sending its stock higher in after-hours trading Wednesday.Beginning Wednesday, Netflix said its Basic and Premium plans will now cost $11.99 and $22.99, respectively, in the US. That's up from the prior $9.99 and $19.99 price points. Netflix’s $6.99 ad-supported plan and $15.49 Standard plan will stay the same price.""Our starting price is extremely competitive with other streamers and at $6.99 per month in the US, for example, it’s much less than the average price of a single movie ticket,"" the company said in its quarterly release. The last time Netflix raised prices was in March 2022.The stock surged in after-hours trading as a result, up more than as 12%.Revenue slightly beat the company's guidance of $8.52 billion to hit $8.54 billion in the quarter, an increase of nearly 8% compared to the same period last year, as the streamer leans on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing, which rolled out in the US in late May, along with its ad-supported offering.Netflix guided to fourth quarter revenue of $8.69 billion, slightly below consensus expectations of $8.76 billion.Earnings per share (EPS) also beat estimates in the quarter with the company reporting EPS of $3.73, ahead of consensus expectations of $3.49. The company reported EPS of $3.10 in the year-ago period.On the advertising front, Netflix said the adoption of its ads plan continues to grow with membership up almost 70% quarter over quarter with 30% of users signing up to the ad tier in the countries where it's available. The company said there's still ""more work to do to scale this business.""Netflix added 8.8 million new subscribers in the quarter, handily beating expectations of 6.2 million. The company said the higher-than-expected growth was ""due to the roll out of paid sharing, strong, steady programming and the ongoing expansion of streaming globally."" The company had added just 2.41 million paying users in Q3 2022.Story continuesNetflix said it expects fourth quarter subscriber net additions ""to be similar"" to the third quarter's results.Still, despite the surge in paying users, the company was unable to boost average revenue per membership, or ARM.ARM decreased 1% year over year, in line with the company's expectations. Netflix blamed the decline on a number of factors, ""including a higher percentage of membership growth from lower ARM countries, limited price increases over the past 18 months, and some shift in plan mix.""<img alt=""The Netflix logo is displayed at the entrance to Netflix Albuquerque Studios film and television production studio lot in Albuquerque, New Mexico on October 13, 2023.

(PATRICK T.

The company said it expects full-year operating margins to hit 20% — the high end of its previous forecast between 18% and 20%.Free cash flow impressed at $1.89 billion, above consensus calls of $1.27 billion. Netflix boosted its full-year free cash flow guidance to $6.5 billion, up from the prior $5 billion, citing the impact of the double Hollywood strikes.""The last six months have been challenging for our industry given the combined writers and actors strikes in the US,"" the company said in its release. ""While we have reached an agreement with the WGA, negotiations with SAG-AFTRA are ongoing. We’re committed to resolving the remaining issues as quickly as possible so everyone can return to work making movies and TV shows that audiences will love.""As Hollywood productions remain shut down amid the actors strike, the company said it expects to spend around $13 billion on content this year before boosting that number to $17 billion next year, assuming the SAG strike is resolved in the near future.In the meantime, the platform will lean on new programming — such as live events.Earlier this week, the company confirmed the debut of “The Netflix Cup,” a celebrity golf tournament that will feature athletes from ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive"" and “Full Swing.” The event will stream live from Wynn Gold Club in Las Vegas on Nov.14.Outside of content investments, the company said in its shareholder letter that it will plan on ""substantial changes for 2024"" to its executive compensation plan after shareholders rejected a multi-million dollar executive compensation package earlier this summer.The company spent an estimated $166 million on its executive pay package last year.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Pras Subramanian,Tesla earnings: Q3 revenue and profit miss estimates; Cybertruck deliveries to begin in November,"Tesla (TSLA) stock was volatile in after-hours trading after the electric vehicle maker missed on both the top and bottom lines, though the company did reveal that Cybertruck deliveries are on track for November 30th of this year.For the quarter, Tesla reported top-line revenue of $23.4 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $24.06 billion, however revenue did climb 13% from a year ago. From a profitability standpoint, Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.66 versus $0.74 expected and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion versus the $2.56 billion expected, which is nearly 37% lower than a year ago.The drop in profitability could be attributed to expected downward pressure on margins since Tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late last year. Tesla reported Q3 gross margin of 17.9%, slightly missing Wall Street estimates of 18.0%. Last quarter Tesla reported gross margin of 18.2%.Tesla, however, did reiterate its 2023 production goal of 1.8 million vehicles. Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 435,059 vehicles globally, of which approximately 419,000 were Model Y and Model 3 vehicles and around 16,000 were higher-priced Model X and Model S cars. Wall Street consensus estimates had deliveries pegged at 456,722.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13214098/embed?auto=1></iframe>Through three quarters of the year Tesla has delivered around 1.3 million vehicles globally, so the company will need a very strong quarter — of around 500,000 — to hit its annual delivery goal. Tesla did project that it expects Model Y production to gradually ramp up higher at Giga Austin and Giga Berlin.Also, CEO Elon Musk noted on the conference call that while Tesla is laying the ground work to begin construction on Giga Mexico, he wanted to get a sense first of global economic conditions before going ""full tilt"" on the buildout. Musk raised concerns about the rising interest rate environment as an impediment to growth, but said Tesla will eventually build the factory in Mexico when questioned about the project's future.Story continuesLooking ahead to future products, Tesla revealed Cybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year, with deliveries beginning on November 30. On the conference call, Musk said it would take a year to 18 months before the Cybertruck would be cash-flow positive, and that by 2025 he expected a production run rate of 250,000 units a year.<img alt=""From Tesla&#39;s Q3 2023 shareholder deck"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4WUAOwaZKUhHBdnEaqyktA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/0eada460-6df5-11ee-abf9-9ef3b904b6ca class=caas-img>From Tesla's Q3 2023 shareholder deck.

Ben Werschkul,Calls to empower Patrick McHenry get louder as Republicans again fail to pick a speaker,"Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) fell short for a second time in his quest for the speaker’s gavel Wednesday, with more of his GOP colleagues voting against him today than yesterday. The resilient opposition to his hardline candidacy is fueling new calls for a stopgap maneuver to get the House operational again.The idea that has been put forth by both Democrats and Republicans in recent days would empower Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) with new powers. He currently oversees the chamber as speaker pro tempore but operates with restricted powers.For now, McHenry only has the authority to convene a vote for the next full speaker but growing his powers could at least temporarily allay some fears on Wall Street and in the business world about the seemingly endless dysfunction on Capitol Hill.<img alt=""Temporary House speaker Rep.

Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) gavels the House into session Wednesday as Republicans try for a second day to elect a speaker. (Alex Brandon/AP Photo)McHenry was a key architect of this spring’s debt-ceiling deal that averted a financial catastrophe and he would be faced with similar challenges in the weeks ahead, with government spending fights looming between now and the end of the year between House Republicans and the Senate and the White House.Depending on the scope of his power, McHenry could also theoretically push forward business world priorities, notably two ongoing cryptocurrency efforts — one bill focused on crypto’s market structure and another focused on stablecoins — that he has championed as chair of the House Financial Services Committee.Boldfaced names behind the ideaWhile McHenry himself has repeatedly batted down the idea, a growing number of prominent conservative figures and organizations have warmed up to it.Three former GOP House speakers — Newt Gingrich, John Boehner, and Paul Ryan — have openly highlighted the idea.In comments at Harvard on Tuesday, Ryan called it a ""break the glass, last resort"" option but quickly added ""that’s probably where they're going to end up if Jim Jordan can’t put it together.""The idea has also been espoused in various influential conservative forums like the Wall Street Journal editorial page as well as by Jordan opponents like Reps. Mario Díaz-Balart (R.-Fla.) and Mike Kelly (R-Penn.).Story continuesI am requesting that the House immediately come back for a second vote on the Speaker @PatrickMcHenry pic.twitter.com/3eH1Jw9tQj— Mario Diaz-Balart (@MarioDB) October 17, 2023The surge in GOP support for the idea comes after the idea has been touted by Democrats over the last week.""We strongly support an immediate vote to expand the Speaker Pro Tempore's authorities to allow for the consideration of a legislative agenda limited to the most pressing issues,"" wrote four moderate Democratic lawmakers in a letter last week.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries added Tuesday that there are ""ongoing informal conversations"" around bipartisan compromises.Many challenges aheadOf course the idea of empowering McHenry faces significant challenges ahead, notably from Jordan and his allies who appear poised to keep fighting even after losing two rounds of voting.Any measure to empower McHenry would almost surely require both Democrats' and Republicans' votes and could gain the intense ire of some on the far right. For example, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has already been criticizing McHenry for how he’s exercised his limited powers.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15180260/embed?auto=1></iframe>The extent and duration of McHenry’s possible powers could also be a point of contention if the idea advances further.The various comments in support of the idea differ on significant details, such as whether McHenry should be empowered until a certain date or indefinitely.Also up for debate is whether he would be able to address any issue that arises or focus only on certain circumscribed ideas like a government shutdown and foreign aid. There is also an open question about whether an empowered speaker pro tempore would be in the presidential line of succession.Finally, McHenry himself is also a wild card. He has repeatedly downplayed the idea in comments to reporters on Capitol Hill.McHenry is also a close ally of Kevin McCarthy, who selected him for his current position atop the House, but has avoided calls to join the House leadership on a permanent basis for years, preferring instead to serve as chair of the Financial Services Committee.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

Julie Hyman,Why you shouldn't listen to Jamie Dimon,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsEarlier in the week, Jamie Dimon got our attention by calling this perhaps “the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.”And that may be true, from a geopolitical perspective. Wars are now raging in both Ukraine and Israel, with broader implications. Dimon also pointed to the risks of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program at a time when inflation is persisting.As my colleague Brian Sozzi wrote this week, when one of the most powerful CEOs in the world makes a dramatic comment like that, you take notice.But in markets, it’s always a good idea to think about how someone may be talking his book.“For Jamie Dimon — for a bank that has strongly outperformed its peers, it’s a matter really of trying to lower expectations,” Ken Leon, a veteran bank analyst at CFRA, told Yahoo Finance Live. “That’s always his mission, to lower the bar, because it’s the one bank every quarter that outperforms and delivers across all the lines of business.” (JPM happens to be one of Leon’s top picks).And if you tune Dimon out, there are quite a few reassuring signals.Take Tuesday’s retail sales report, which came in double economists’ estimates. While it could put pressure on the Fed to raise rates once again, central bank officials have presented a remarkably consistent message over the past couple of weeks: They are willing to be patient, and higher Treasury yields are helping tighten financial conditions without them having to further raise rates at this time.Spurred by that retail sales data, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast now stands at 5.4% annualized growth for the third quarter. The S&P 500 has bounced back by more than 3% since early October. Early earnings from the big banks and the likes of Johnson & Johnson have beat estimates.Story continuesBank of America’s weekly fund flows data showed an 11th straight week of inflows into equities, with buyers favoring cyclicals over defensives — implying optimism about economic growth.Maybe investors should pay attention to what Dimon said after his warning: “While we hope for the best, we prepare the Firm for a broad range of outcomes so we can consistently deliver for clients no matter the environment.”In other words, while there appear to be positive signs for the economy and markets, it never hurts to be prepared for anything.<img alt=""morning brief image"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XHcvRRyUwTAVsA6.w0XlUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b99a27b0-d942-11ed-bfe1-d845793f82c4 class=caas-img>morning brief imageClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
Josh Schafer,Goldman: 15 million Americans will be taking weight loss drugs by 2030,"Predictions for the size of the market for prescription weight loss drugs keep growing.New research from Goldman Sachs projects 15 million adults in the US will be on anti-obesity medications by 2030, representing 13% penetration in the US adult population — not including diabetic patients.Globally, Goldman Sachs sees sales for chronic weight management reaching $100 billion by 2030, up from a $6 billion annualized estimate earlier this year.""The chronic weight management market is undergoing an inflection, in our view, with potential for solid growth ahead and a peak opportunity that, by our estimates, could ultimately yield some of the highest grossing drugs of all time,"" a team of Goldman Sachs analysts led by Chris Shibutani wrote in a research note on Monday.Recent buzz about the impact of the weight loss drugs has caught the attention of Wall Street. Several analysts have questioned whether drugs like Ozempic could hamper demand for fast food and food sales at retailers like Walmart (WMT), which has said the drug was leading to lower revenue.The excitement has driven stock gains for prescription drugs producers Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lily (LLY). Last week, Novo Nordisk raised its full-year sales guidance on a better-than-expected sales outlook from its diabetes drug, Ozempic. The drug isn't approved directly for weight loss, but it's still become a popular use for the drug. Meanwhile during its most recent quarterly earnings report in August, Eli Lily raised its own sales guidance on increased demand for its Type 2 diabetes management drug, Mounjaro.Part of Goldman Sachs's prediction of a $100 billion weight loss drug market reflects the growing number of obese people worldwide. Goldman Sachs cites World Health Organization data noting that obesity has nearly tripled worldwide since 1975. They also highlight the World Obesity Atlas, which expects over half of the global population will be overweight or obese by 2035.Story continuesOne of the key headwinds to wider adoption will be government approval. Novo Nordisk's Wegovy has been approved specifically for weight loss, but Eli Lily's drug is still in the process. Goldman estimates that Eli Lily's Tirzepatide product, which is still awaiting approval, will account for more than one-third of the prescription weight loss market by 2030.Additionally, insurance coverage and how long patients will use the drug still remain up in the air.Goldman projects 90% of employers will provide insurance coverage for anti-obesity medications by 2030, while the trajectory for how long patients take the drug remains a ""key unknown."" Some studies, like one from UCHealth, have shown patients will take the drugs indefinitely. But Goldman wasn't that extreme.""We believe a reasonable assumption at this juncture is to assume a duration of 12 months on average, recognizing that introduction of orals and novel mechanisms will likely influence how long patients remain on AOMs,"" Goldman's team of analysts wrote.The market could get even bigger, too.""Meaningful uptake in pediatric-age ... individuals would represent upside to our estimates,"" Goldman Sachs said.<img alt=""Still life of Wegovy an injectable prescription weight loss medicine that has helped people with obesity.

Retail sales have now grown from the month prior for six-straight months, marking a consistent trend of consumer spending.This, economists say has been supported by an average of nearly 270,000 nonfarm payroll additions over the same period. With no clear signs of the labor market fully cooling, the strong position of the US consumer entering the fourth quarter of 2023 could provide upside risks to inflation and therefore more Fed rate hikes.""The economy is entering Q4 with more momentum than we previously thought,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ""The risks to our forecast for a slight contraction in consumption in Q4 are firmly to the upside. The strength of the economy also means that Fed officials will leave the door open for additional rate hikes.""Fed Chair Jerome Powell has noted in the past that a stronger US economy could mean more Fed rate hikes.""We’re not looking for a decrease in consumer spending,"" Powell said on September. ""It’s a good thing that the economy’s strong...If the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2 percent [inflation]—because we will get back to 2 percent.""Over the past week, Fed officials eased market concerns of another interest rate hike from the central bank as they explained how credit tightening caused by rising bond yields could effectively take the place of another Fed rate hike. The discussion provided reprieve for bond yields and stocks rallied.But that shifted on Tuesday. Markets are now pricing in a roughly 40% chance that the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates at its December meeting, up from a 25% chance just a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Stocks opened lower after the report too, while bond yields rose. The 10-year Treasury yield breached 4.85%, its highest level in more than a week and just off its 16-year highs.“Today’s strong report along with a recent string of positive economic surprises suggest the economy carried more momentum than previously thought over the summer,"" EY-Parthenon Senior Economist Lydia Boussour wrote in a research note on Tuesday.

Ben Werschkul,"Two long-shot options to restart the House if Jim Jordan isn’t elected speaker

Josh Schafer,Resilient consumer keeps pressure on Fed,"A hot jobs market is continuing to help boost consumer spending.Retail sales rose 0.7% in September from the previous month, more than double Wall Street's estimates for 0.3% growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department released on Tuesday. Retail sales have now grown from the month prior for six straight months, marking a consistent trend of consumer spending.This, economists say, has been supported by an average of nearly 270,000 nonfarm payroll additions over the same period. With no clear signs of the labor market fully cooling, the strong position of the US consumer entering the fourth quarter of 2023 could provide upside risks to inflation that's already showing signs of stickiness — and prompt more Fed rate hikes.""The economy is entering Q4 with more momentum than we previously thought,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ""The risks to our forecast for a slight contraction in consumption in Q4 are firmly to the upside. The strength of the economy also means that Fed officials will leave the door open for additional rate hikes.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/14477522/embed?auto=1></iframe>Fed Chair Jerome Powell has noted in the past that a stronger US economy could mean more Fed rate hikes to ensure prices fall.""We’re not looking for a decrease in consumer spending,"" Powell said in September. ""It’s a good thing that the economy’s strong ... If the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2% [inflation]—because we will get back to 2%.""Over the past week, Fed officials eased market concerns of another interest rate hike as central bankers explained credit tightening caused by rising bond yields could effectively take the place of another Fed rate hike. The discussion provided reprieve for bond yields, and stocks rallied.But that shifted on Tuesday with the September retail sales report. Markets as of Tuesday afternoon are pricing in a roughly 40% chance that the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates at its December meeting, up from a 25% chance just a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Stocks opened lower after the report, too, while bond yields rose. The 10-year Treasury yield breached 4.85%, its highest level in more than a week and just off its 16-year highs.Story continues“Today’s strong report along with a recent string of positive economic surprises suggest the economy carried more momentum than previously thought over the summer,"" EY-Parthenon senior economist Lydia Boussour wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ""This will keep the Federal Reserve on high inflation alert, and though it won’t tilt the Federal Open Market Committee toward another fed funds rate hike at the November meeting, the December meeting will very much remain a ‘live’ one.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13015579/embed?auto=1></iframe>All eyes on the labor market The overall picture for the consumer is still murky. Credit card delinquencies have been on the rise, the personal savings rate just hit its lowest level of 2023, and it's still unclear how the return of student loan payments could hurt consumer spending.""Pandemic-related sources of spending like excess savings and easy access to cheap credit are fading, but what this report tells us is that households have grown more comfortable spending at elevated rates,"" Wells Fargo's senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a research note on Tuesday.And Quinlan highlights that willingness to spend might not be going anywhere.""We have long stressed that real income is the last major driver of spending, and continued labor market tightness suggests income can continue to fuel consumption in the near term,"" Quinlan wrote. ""In fact, the only thing that looks to break the back of this consumer would be weakness in the labor market.But consistent weakness in the labor market isn't apparent at the moment. Outside of wages retreating toward pre-pandemic normalcy, the labor market remains robust. The US economy added more jobs in September than it had since January. Job openings still remain historically high as the most people look for jobs since before the pandemic. And layoffs have been muted as jobless claims have remained tame.""We expect the consumer to remain supported in the next couple of quarters as long as the labor market remains strong,"" Citi's economics team wrote in a research note on Tuesday.On Thursday, Powell is expected to provide an update on the economy during a speech at the Economic Club of New York.<img alt=""Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell holds a news conference after the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2023.

David Hollerith,Goldman's profit declines amid costly retreat from consumer banking,"Third quarter profits at Goldman Sachs (GS) fell as the Wall Street giant continued its costly retreat from consumer banking and tried to recover from a prolonged slump in dealmaking.Its earnings were $2.06 billion, down 33% from $3.07 billion a year ago. That result was affected by a $506 million write-down on GreenSky, a specialty lender it agreed to sell, and $358 million in impairments on real estate investments.Its performance during the quarter trailed other big-bank rivals JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC), all of which reported profit increases year over year.But there were some positives. Earnings at Goldman were up 69% when compared to the second quarter, a period when Goldman reported its lowest quarterly profits since early 2020. Its investment banking fees of $1.5 billion were up 9% from the second quarter and up 1% from a year ago.Goldman helped a number of prominent companies, including Arm (ARM) and Instacart (CART), go public in the second quarter.Fixed-income trading revenues were also up 25% from the second quarter although down 6% from a year ago. Equities trading was flat when compared with the second quarter and up 8% from a year ago.""I also expect a continued recovery in both capital markets and strategic activity if conditions remain conducive,"" Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. ""As the leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity will undoubtedly be a tailwind for Goldman Sachs.""Goldman's stock fell 1.6% Tuesday.Solomon is under pressure to improve Goldman's results after wrestling with everything from job cuts and a global investment banking slump to reports of partner unrest. He is trying to focus the firm around its traditional core strengths of wealth management, trading, and investment banking.In recent months he agreed to sell GreenSky to an investment consortium and announced Goldman had found a buyer for a personal finance unit that serves the mass affluent.Story continuesGoldman is selling GreenSky less than two years after buying it in 2022 for $1.73 billion. It provided Goldman with a fintech platform for home improvement lending, but the firm looked to sell it as it decided to move away from a push into consumer banking.<img alt=""Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon speaks during the Goldman Sachs Investor Day at Goldman Sachs Headquarters in New York City, U.S., February 28, 2023.

David Hollerith,Bank of America profit rises 10%,"Third quarter profits at Bank of America (BAC) were up 10% from a year ago, as the second-largest US bank got a boost from higher interest income and a strong performance from its Wall Street unit.It reported earnings of $7.8 billion and revenue of $25.2 billion, which was up 3% from a year ago. Its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it makes on its loans and pays for its deposits, rose 4% year over year.Its trading and investment banking revenues were also up, a sign that a slump in dealmaking is starting to thaw.CEO Brian Moynihan said: ""We did this in a healthy but slowing economy that saw US consumer spending still ahead of last year but continuing to slow.""<img alt=""Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan testifies before a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs hearing on "" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.vleqSUtpKAcZIfvmI4kLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwOTtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/b6d4ef20-6c6c-11ee-a8f9-c8515bd389ab class=caas-img>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.

Its stock hit a three-year low in October and is trailing JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) since the beginning of the year.Bank of America's stock rose 2.3% Tuesday.Its other rivals also reported rises in third quarter profit due largely to rising interest income.But one concern from investors is how Bank of America's investment portfolio is faring during this extended period of elevated interest rates.Bank of America is paying for a decision to pile hundreds of billions into longer-dated Treasurys and mortgage bonds during the early days of the pandemic when banks were awash in new deposits.The value of those holdings went down once the Federal Reserve began raising rates, meaning the bank is earning less from its investments.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsIt amassed more than $109 billion in paper losses on those debt securities as of June 30, and that number rose to $136 billion as of the end of the third quarter.Analysts don’t expect Bank of America to have a need to sell those holdings, and therefore book a loss.There were also some signs from Bank of America that some of its customers are running into problems as borrowing costs rise. Its net charge-offs were $931 million, up 79% from the year-ago period. The money it set aside for future loan losses also rose.Story continuesThe bank's CFO, Alastair Borthwick, also urged caution about hopes for a new boom in investment banking.""We haven't yet seen that confidence return to the equity capital markets necessarily in the same way,"" he said.

Reuters,Goldman Sachs lifts Europe Inc's 2023 profit growth forecast to 3%,"Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it expects earnings for companies in the pan-European STOXX 600 index to grow 3% in 2023, compared with its prior projection of no growth, on the back of higher oil prices.Benchmark Brent crude futures have risen 6% since the conflict in the Middle East began earlier this month, and trade around $89 a barrel. Analysts at the brokerage expect Brent to end the year at $88 a barrel.According to Goldman Sachs, higher oil prices will feed into higher revenues, benefiting commodity-related sectors — for which analysts at the brokerage expect positive earnings upgrades.Shares of European oil majors BP, Shell and TotalEnergies have gained between 4.5% and 7% since the conflict began. [O/R]Europe's oil and gas sector hit nine-year highs on Monday, and leapt almost 7% since Oct. 6. The sector is up 8.3% so far this year, ahead of the STOXX 600's 6% gain during the period.Adjusting for inflation, however, Goldman Sachs expects earnings in Europe to fall 2% this year. Cost of debt due to rising bond yields also poses a threat to profits, it said. [GVD/EUR]""We estimate that a 100-basis-point rise in the cost of debt would knock 3 percentage points off (STOXX 600's) EPS (earnings per share),"" said Lilia Peytavin, portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs.For the next year, Goldman Sachs forecasts earnings growth of 7%, versus 5% estimated previously, on anticipation of oil prices hitting $100 per barrel by end-2024.Through 2025, Goldman expects European and U.S. companies' profits to grow at 5% annually from current levels, but only 2% in real terms for Europe in the same period.(Reporting by Roshan Abraham and Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)"
Myles Udland,Wall Street's 2024 inflation surprise is coming into focus,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsWith 2023 wrapping up, Wall Street has started to plan for 2024.And with this planning we've seen emerge a key consensus view that will shape much of the discussion about the year ahead — inflation continuing to fall.In an interview with the Financial Times published Monday, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said it was ""undeniable"" that inflation's drop is a trend rather than a one-month blip. Patrick Harker, president of the Philadelphia Fed, said Monday in a speech there is ""steady disinflation underway,"" adding that he expects inflation to fall below 3% next year.Harker and Goolsbee are both voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed committee that votes on monetary policy changes.<img alt=""Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee gestures as he heads into the Kansas City Fed&#39;s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, U.S., August 24, 2023.

(Ann Saphir/REUTERS)The Federal Reserve's latest inflation forecast published in September said core PCE — the central bank's preferred inflation reading — will likely finish next year at 2.6%, down from 3.7% at the end of this year. As of August, core PCE inflation was running at 3.9% annually.And last week, the September CPI report showed headline inflation stood at 3.7% annually, unchanged from August, as ""core"" prices, which strip out food and energy, rose 4.1% over the prior year. The Fed targets 2% inflation.At least one commentator referred to this report as ""reassuringly uneventful"" and an extension of the disinflation narrative taking hold in markets.In a note to clients on Monday, RBC strategist Lori Calvasina raised her expectations for corporate profits over the balance of this year and next. And partly driving this view is a continued easing of inflation pressures.""Our 2024 forecast assumes a significant moderation in inflation, easing of interest rate pressures in the back half of the year, and sluggish GDP and industrial production forecasts,"" Calvasina wrote. ""This is the current consensus view among economists, but may be revised as 2024 outlooks are refined.""Story continuesCalvasina said the firm's view on inflation is that inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ""will fall to the low 2% range"" next year, dragging down revenue but helping ease interest rate pressures in the back half of 2024.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/12036059/embed?auto=1></iframe>But data late last week from the University of Michigan revealed consumers aren't yet sold on this disinflationary trend sticking around.The university's initial read on consumer sentiment in October showed year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 3.8% from 3.2% in September. This comes as gas prices have risen in recent months with the price of oil reaching $93 a barrel in late September.Of course, consumer views on the economy can be fickle and particularly sensitive to changes in gas prices. And this near-term discrepancy between the ""Wall Street"" and ""Main Street"" view of the economy is, for now, just that: a near-term discrepancy.This divide, however, offers a reminder of how the Wall Street consensus view for 2023 turned out to be wrong. Calls for a recession in the first part of the year accompanied by lower stock prices were instead met by a durable economic expansion and an AI craze that pushed markets higher.A strong labor market and steady consumer spending have buoyed the economy in 2023, postponing a recession that many forecasters rolled to next year.All of this means that the specter of inflation, consumer spending, and the labor market each rolling over still hangs in the air to haunt 2024 — and Wall Street forecasts.<img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XHcvRRyUwTAVsA6.w0XlUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b99a27b0-d942-11ed-bfe1-d845793f82c4 class=caas-img>Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

Josh Schafer,Earnings season off to strong start despite 'uncertain macro' environment ahead,"The predictions for an end to the earnings recession have passed their first test.Of the 32 S&P 500 companies that have so far reported earnings, they are beating Wall Street's expectations by an average of 9% on earnings per share, according to Bank of America Research's equity strategy team. In aggregate, after two quarters of declines, EPS for S&P 500 companies is up 1% compared to the same quarter last year in a sign that corporate America's earnings recession may be over.In a research note Monday, RBC Capital's head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina described the start of earnings season as ""solid"" despite ""macro headwinds.""And, importantly, despite challenges such as sticky inflation and a higher for longer stance from the Federal Reserve, RBC raised its S&P 500 EPS forecast. RBC's latest accounting for recent macro movements pushed their projections higher, with S&P 500 earnings up to $223 (from $220) in 2023 and $232 (from $229) in 2024.But while the estimate boost for Q3 earnings could imply a more glossy outlook for the index, Calvasina's S&P 500 price target for 2023 remains unchanged at 4,250, as the strategists note S&P 500 EPS is just one of several things that drive their calls.When zooming out beyond just earnings, Calvasina still finds the macro picture to be choppy.""Our review of S&P 500 earnings call transcripts since late September suggests the macro is taking a toll,"" Calvasina wrote. ""Companies continue to emphasize the resiliency of a consumer who has become more selective in their spending. We are also reading about how macro uncertainty, including inflation and interest rate policy, are impacting demand and spending, though this is more on the corporate side. Pricing commentary remains mixed, with a fair amount of emphasis on how it’s moderating.""Throughout the early part of earnings season, though, the numbers companies report are appearing to drive stock action rather than the headwinds they may be commenting on.Story continuesPerhaps no earnings release was a clearer example of this than JPMorgan's (JPM). The head of America's leading financial institution had a grim view on the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" JPMorgan chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in the company's earnings release.But despite the characterization, JPMorgan investors seemed more focused on another blowout quarter for profits as the stock rose more than 1.5% on Friday.The same could be said for the S&P 500, which is up nearly 1% since Pepsi reported strong results on Oct. 10.<img alt=""JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon speaks at the Boston College Chief Executives Club luncheon in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., November 23, 2021.

Brian Sozzi,Why you should carefully consider what Jamie Dimon just told the investing world,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsI was sitting in a Washington, D.C., hotel room for the start of bank earnings last Friday morning, a.k.a. the official beginning of earnings season.I had my normal earnings day routine in full effect: Three large iced coffees nearby, a digital notebook, a pair of headphones, soft-to-the-touch Lululemon clothing, and a story template open and ready to rock.There were three things I wanted to learn from the big banks: 1) charge-off trends (we cover a lot of retail names here at Yahoo Finance), 2) the state of the deal market, and 3) commentary around Wall Street hiring trends.I proceeded to open up the JPMorgan earnings release. Per usual, I combed through the numbers along the left rail of the first page. Then, per usual, I focused on the box on the bottom right of the page for the latest commentary from its CEO Jamie Dimon.This comment from Dimon immediately popped out: ""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.""""Wow, that is pretty intense from Jamie,"" I said to myself. ""Never heard that tone from him before — what does it mean to the average investor?""With that comment right there from Dimon, the complexion of this earnings season has dramatically changed. The approach to investing in the market has changed into year-end, I think.One sentence by the most powerful CEO in the game today. And when he says something like that it warrants a new way of thinking by investors.Dimon followed up on this thread on the earnings call: ""My caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there, you just got to be very cautious."" He added he is concerned about government debt levels and inflation, two topics he has focused on in various venues in recent months.Story continuesYou may be asking yourself why, several days later, I am still harping on these comments.Here's why.The most powerful CEO in the world with the biggest network and the best information is using all of that to put forth guidance to his various stakeholders and followers. Dimon in no way takes making a statement like that lightly. He knows the gravity of his words.But then, in reality, Dimon is quite correct in his assessment.The Israel-Hamas war continues to play out on a grand stage worldwide, injecting fresh geopolitical uncertainties. The Ukraine-Russia war rages. All of this has ties back to China and resurfaces our contentious relationship with that country.The US House of Representatives is a flat-out mess that is making the country look bad again.‌There is still a chance of a mid-November government shutdown. Inflation is stubborn and rate hikes continue to permeate the economy. Government debt levels are crazy and getting crazier.Now if you follow the Warren Buffett style of investing, then none of this stuff matters. You buy stocks deemed attractively valued and shuffle along for the next 75 years drinking Coca-Cola.Not everyone subscribes to that approach, though, and many are trying to live for today by investing in the markets or other assets. To that end, it feels appropriate to have more caution on asset allocation in the near term until some of the aforementioned issues cool down. Besides, stock valuations aren't exactly cheap.‌It often pays to listen to smart people in investing, and Dimon is obviously one of the smartest people in the room.‌In case you were wondering, I got my charge-off answer.On JPM's media call, CFO Jeremy Barnum (another smart exec) told me he isn't seeing ""acute pain"" in consumers from higher interest rates. It was a fair response but I think one that suggests those retailers we follow here at Yahoo Finance will report tepid third quarter results.‌Hey, I am pretty smart, too.<img alt=""morning brief image"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XHcvRRyUwTAVsA6.w0XlUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b99a27b0-d942-11ed-bfe1-d845793f82c4 class=caas-img>morning brief imageBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Seana Smith,"'Fog on the horizon': CEOs brace for recession
A soft landing looks elusive as geopolitical risk raises bets of a recession.","Wall Street’s great debate of 2023 — whether the US economy is headed for a recession — is resurfacing amid escalating unrest in the Middle East.Heightened geopolitical risk, along with unabating inflationary pressures, surging bond yields, and the Federal Reserve’s ""higher for longer"" vision, has business leaders bracing for a contraction.“There’s a lot of fog on the horizon,” KPMG US CEO Paul Knopp told Yahoo Finance Live, citing geopolitical tensions as one of the top risks to the economy.Seventy-two percent of CEOs are preparing for a US recession over the next 12-18 months, according to The Conference Board’s survey of business leaders. While that’s an improvement from the start of the year, expectations about the short-term economic outlook have darkened.Big bank CEOs are among those weighing in on a more uncertain economic outlook. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon pointed to a number of potential risks, including a sober warning on geopolitical crises abroad. Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser noted “an increasingly cautious consumer” in the bank’s earnings release Friday.<img alt=""Jamie Dimon on recession risk "" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PMxqIBydwX1fZS3.H_YdSA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/6309c630-6a10-11ee-acc7-554e00d39dcc class=caas-img>Jamie Dimon on recession risk Fraser’s note of cracks beginning to form in consumer spending is something that’s been highlighted recently. Constellation Brands (STZ) CEO Bill Newlands told Yahoo Finance Live this week that shoppers are already ""spending a little less"" while being more ""careful"" about what they buy.The reason this is problematic is because the resilient consumer has helped the US economy defy recession predictions so far this year, as consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US GDP.And if you look at the recent sentiment data, it’s not too encouraging. Consumer sentiment plunged in October to its lowest level in five months, driven in large part by households expecting higher inflation next year.And sticky inflation is not just an issue for consumers, but for the Fed too. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed prices held steady at 3.7% in September, well above the Fed's goal of 2%.Story continues<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/6180194/embed?auto=1></iframe>“With the Fed committed to returning inflation back to its long-run target of 2%, this would raise the odds of rate increases this year, extend the duration of restrictive monetary policy, and increase the chances of a recession occurring down the road,” Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients this week.To sum it up: The probability of a recession is still anyone’s guess, but it’s safe to say the economic outlook remains murky.

Dylan Croll,Younger adults are upbeat about their financial future even though many are struggling,"Young adults are surprisingly optimistic about their own financial futures despite crushing inflation and lingering fears of recession.A new study found that 80% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 are struggling or merely surviving financially. But the vast majority — 72% — believe they'll be thriving in five years and 79% expect to get there in 30 years, according to the study from Edward Jones and MIT’s AgeLab Next360, which polled 2,003 adults in that age group.The study offers insight into what this cohort wants from their lives as they age, and reveals how personal finance advice could help them overcome the challenges they face in getting there.""While some feel like they're just surviving, maybe barely keeping their head above water, they must feel deep down, 'I just need a few years. I need one break. Just one break in my life to finally pay this student loan off or this credit card debt,'"" said Andrew Herzog, a financial planner at the Watchman Group.

But in five years, 72% see themselves ""thriving,"" with just 22% forecasting they’ll still be just ""surviving"" and 6% saying they'll still be struggling. In 30 years, there’s greater optimism — 79% envision themselves as thriving, while only 16% said they would be surviving and 4% said they would be struggling.The study also revealed that these adults share many of the same life goals as previous generations. The survey found that 80% have or want children and that 65% of study participants hope to be homeowners one day. Meanwhile, 2 in 3 have married or expect to in the future.But despite their ambition and optimism, these adults face many challenges getting to where they want to be. These adults reported that basic living expenses and rising inflation are the biggest obstacles to achieving their five-year goals.Story continuesJust 13% have paid off college debt, only 31% have a retirement account, and 57% have health insurance, according to the study. Nearly 20% have already been laid off from a job.""For those who are planning to have kids or just had or had kids, health care, childcare is incredibly expensive. Daycare for myself is about the cost of my mortgage,"" said Eric Scruggs, a financial planner at Hark Financial Planning. ""And so there's a lot to balance with the cost of living, and wages haven't particularly kept up.""The study also pointed out that many members of this group grew up in the shadow of the Great Recession, which influenced their relationship with money.""They saw parents lose their jobs and homes,"" Lena Haas, head of wealth management advice and solutions at Edward Jones, said.

""And at least, if nothing else, understand the trade off you're making so that you're making an informed choice.

Ronda Lee,Student loan borrowers will get a hand in saving for retirement next year,"A new federal rule next year will make it easier for borrowers paying back their student loans to also save for their retirement.Section 110 of the SECURE 2.0 Act, legislation signed into law last December, will allow employers to provide 401(k), 403(b), or SIMPLE IRA matching for qualified student loan payments. The provision is optional and effective January 2024.This change helps to address a longstanding challenge for most borrowers: paying back student debt prevents them from saving for other goals, a problem that has resurfaced now that federal loan payments are no longer on pause. Additionally, this provision can benefit employers as far as retention, reducing attrition, and recruiting new talent.""It’s impossible to ignore the long-term financial impact student loan repayments can have on employees across all generations,"" Eric Stevenson, president of Nationwide Retirement Solutions, said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Tesla and Netflix will highlight the start of tech earnings.A September retail sales report is expected to show minor growth amid an otherwise quiet week for economic data.Recent economic data showed inflation cooling enough for the market to bet that the Fed won't raise interest rates at its November meeting but stocks still struggled to find solid footing as rising geopolitical risks and the fallout from higher for longer interest rates continue to cloud the picture.In the past week, the Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell nearly 0.2% while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.8%.Inflation data out last week showed cooling price increases under the surface. The data left markets optimistic on a rate pause in November as Fed officials expressed that higher yields could provide necessary monetary tightening and effectively take the place of another interest rate hike.But combined with a hot September jobs report, there isn't a broad consensus that the Fed is done hiking altogether.""Continued strength in the labor market could lead to persistence in wage growth and forestall declines in consumption growth, which would leave price pressures elevated and growth above trend,"" Oxford Economics' team of economists wrote in a research note on Thursday.

""This is likely due to re-focusing on getting timing, content, and pricing structures in a better position to increase borrower retention.

David Hollerith,Big banks are benefiting from higher rates. Their customers aren't.,"Higher interest rates are lifting the fortunes of the nation’s biggest banks. They aren’t doing the same for the banks’ customers.Earnings for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) all rose in the third quarter largely because high rates allowed them to rake in more interest income.Their scale allows them to leverage those rates by charging more for loans while holding down how much more they pay for deposits when compared to smaller rivals.These advantages show up in a key profitability metric known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks make on their loans and pay for their deposits.That number was up by sizable amounts at all three banks when compared to the same period a year ago. Together the lenders pulled in a record $50 billion, 18% more than the same period last year. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo even lifted their guidance for how much net interest income they would earn for the full year.Yet there were also clear signs that some of their borrowers are starting to struggle. JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all increased the amount of loans they wrote off as losses. The combined charge-offs at those three banks totaled $3.98 billion, up 31% from the previous quarter and 105% from the same period a year ago.The total was the highest amount collectively for the three lenders since the early days of the pandemic, in the second quarter of 2020.At Citigroup, CEO Jane Fraser warned that US consumers were cutting back. “Continued deceleration in spending indicates an increasingly cautious consumer,” she said in a release.Affluent customers, she added, are accounting for almost all of the spending growth and weakness is showing among those with lower credit scores. Citi expects its credit card losses to reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the year.<img alt=""Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser attends a U.S. House Financial Services Committee hearing titled &#x00201c;Holding Megabanks Accountable: Oversight of America&#x002019;s Largest Consumer Facing Banks&#x00201d; on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 21, 2022.

It expects net interest income to fall again in the fourth quarter when compared to the third.The Pittsburgh bank said it would reduce its staff by roughly 4%, saving $325 million.

Irina Ivanova,The labor shortage is here for one reason—and it’s quiet quitting,"One question has hovered over the post-pandemic economy for the better part of three years: Where are all the workers? Businesses’ difficulty hiring has been blamed on a gamut of ills: Too-generous unemployment benefits; too many stimulus checks; not enough immigration; too many workers with long COVID, and, finally, simple laziness.Now, a recent study suggests a different answer: Workers are still there—they’re just not working as hard.Three researchers at Washington University in St. Louis crunched federal data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey and found that most of the drop in hours worked came from people who stayed employed, but worked fewer hours. Their results were published recently in a working paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.“It’s not that fewer people are willing to work—if anything, more people are willing to work than before the pandemic,” co-author Yongseok Shin, a Washington University professor, told Fortune. “But it’s that some people are cutting back their hours.”View this interactive chart on Fortune.comShin and his co-authors, PhD candidates Dain Lee and Jinhyeok Park, found that 55% of the drop in labor supply since the pandemic was due to a decline in hours, while the rest came from people dropping out of the labor force. And it’s not early retirees who are cutting back, either: Most of the reduction came from highly educated men working intensive jobs of 50 hours a week or more, Shin said.“It’s actually young people, 25 to 45, who used to work very long hours, who are now cutting back,” he said, noting, “it’s all men—not women.”Quiet quitting and “no-work Fridays” The data helps explain why, even with the labor participation rate near its pre-pandemic level, job openings remain near record highs and hundreds of thousands more jobs are created every month. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is at a mere 3.8%, a rate that was considered unbelievably low a few short years ago.Story continuesShin believes the pandemic, which pushed millions of Americans to reevaluate what was important to them in life, also set off an epidemic of “quiet quitting,” perhaps better described as salaried workers declining to work excessive hours or hustle quite so much.“Everyone reevaluated their work-life balance, and maybe they said, ‘I don’t have to work 55 hours, I’d like to spend more time with family,’” Shin said.In other words, “quiet quitting,” which has previously been blamed for costing the global economy billions, has also successfully supported the tightest job market in a generation and an increasingly emboldened workforce.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comCrucially, while many of these quiet quitters may have wished for less work pre-pandemic, the advent of hybrid or remote work in white-collar fields has given them the leeway to make it a reality. Even in some offices that are calling back their workforces, “no-work Fridays” have become a phenomenon, with empty offices, few meetings and significantly fewer emails—something Shin said he’s seen among his own friends.“That’s the technological dimension that allows [workers] to do this,” Shin said. “Say you’ve done all your work for Friday in the morning, and you know your colleagues are not in front of the computer either — this allows people to shift back a little bit and not work when the work is not there.”Less frequently, the cutback in work comes from above—as when Shopify earlier this year eliminated unnecessary meetings from its workers’ calendars. “No one schedules meetings for a Friday afternoon, or hardly any Friday at all. We all agree, ‘Let’s get everything done by early afternoon,’” one worker at an advertising agency told the lifestyle publication InsideHook.Plenty of corporations are now trying to claw back some of their workers’ newfound free time, whether it’s mandating three days a week in the office, rewarding workers who put in more face time, or simply telling adamant remote workers they can go elsewhere, as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy memorably did this summer.But if the “new normal” is hybrid work, Shin is hopeful that white-collar employees won’t go back to their overworked ways.He doesn’t see the trend as shirking, but as a realignment of people’s workdays with the vagaries of knowledge jobs. “Sometimes you’re just sitting in your office for no obvious reason — it’s not like a production line, where the workflow is constant,” he said.Indeed, “quiet quitting” is a good thing for all parties involved, Shin argued, since it brings famously overworked American professionals more closely in line with their peers in Europe and other developed nations who take longer vacations and work fewer hours than Americans. It’s good for the employer, too, since workers who aren’t burned out can work later in life, if they want to.While Shin’s study only goes through 2022, data from this year shows the trend is sticking, he said. The share of Americans who are working has exceeded its pre-pandemic high, but the number of hours worked per person hasn’t budged.“It seems like this is a collective decision,” he said. “People seem to like it. If this is the new normal, hopefully it can stay.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
Brooke DiPalma,"Chipotle's growth prospects remain strong, even with higher menu prices
Consumers still see Chipotle as a value play over its fast-casual peers.","That chicken burrito with guacamole is soon going to cost a little extra, but that isn't likely to deter loyal Chipotle fans.After announcing a pause earlier this year, the global burrito chain plans to raise prices again for the fourth time in two years. Its chief corporate affairs officer Laurie Schalow said in a statement to Yahoo Finance that the company is making the increase to offset inflation.While the company hasn't said when or how much prices will increase, many on the street speculate it will be roughly a 3%-3.5% increase in the middle of Q4 when an updated menu typically comes out.This comes as commodity prices are sticky, with ""ongoing pressure"" around the price of avocados, beef, and chicken, Citi Analyst Jon Tower said on a phone call with Yahoo Finance.He said another factor could be to get ahead of California's Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act, known as the FAST Act, which moves the minimum wage up to $20, effective April 1, 2024.Though the move may put a sour taste in consumers' mouths, they'll still show up.<img alt=""Chipotle Mexican Grill announced it is testing an automated digital makeline in collaboration with Hyphen.

As consumers opt for quick service instead of casual restaurants due to inflation and tighter wallets, Chipotle is poised to gain additional market share, similar to what it did in 2008 and 2009.And while price is a factor, convenience also plays a role, according to Tower. The company is investing in digital capabilities like mobile orders and its drive-thru concept, Chipotlanes. Upping its digital capabilities will also enable the company to get more customer data.<img alt=""Four growth pillars for Chipotle, based on analyst commentary and Q2 results.

(Graphic created by Yahoo Finance)During Q2, digital sales made up 38% of Chipotle's total food and beverage revenue. Of the 47 new restaurants it opened, 40 locations included a Chipotlane.Story continuesThis year, the company plans to open 255 to 285 new restaurants, and 10-15 existing locations will add a Chipotlane, which Charles said tends to have a higher digital and sales mix, calling it a ""win-win-win.""Is now the time to buy into Chipotle? Perhaps.In the past month, shares of Chipotle are down nearly 8% as it closed at $1,781.48 on Friday. In the last five years, its shares are up more than 300%.Tower, who has a buy rating, recently lowered his price target to $2,260 from $2,391. Both the S&P 500 and restaurant foot traffic were flying high in the summer, but they have since moderated, he said.In September and early October, foot traffic at Chipotles increased, but at a lower rate, according to Citi Research, which cites data from Placer.ai. For example, during the week ending July 16, foot traffic jumped 12.3% compared to a year ago, but in the last week of September, that increase was 3.9%.Though Chipotle trades at a premium compared to its peers, Tower said the current price is still a very attractive entry point, given the company's history of gaining additional market share.The company has also been investing in expansion. In North America, it has set a long-term target of 7,000 restaurants. As of the end of Q2, there were more than 3,200. In July, Chipotle announced its first-ever development agreement to open locations in the Middle East and accelerate its international efforts early next year. The ""long-term possibilities"" are there, Tower said, especially when it comes to new stores. It is on the ""precipice"" of expanding its presence, which will create increasing value over time.Throughput — how fast a Chipotle store can get customers in and out of stores — should improve with new technology in the works, such as Chippy and Autocado. A robot food assembly line could also unlock value.And the expansion of Chipotlanes could open up the restaurants to fulfill additional demand or create new features. A pivot to offering a breakfast menu is a possibility, said Tower.Imagine that: breakfast burritos, tacos, bowls, and maybe even avocado toast.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

In the report, 49% of retired women who were working or looking for work said they need the money compared to 41% of men.One reason is that many women have less savings to depend on in retirement and lower Social Security benefits because of time out of the workplace for caregiving.Learn more about top savings tools: 4 alternatives to savings accounts""Typically, lower incomes, higher debt loads — especially student loans — and shorter job tenures are some of the factors contributing to the gender savings gap,"" Sudipto Banerjee, T.

The US median home price increased by nearly 40% to $373,253 in the third quarter from $266,861 in the same period in 2019.The average percentage of deposit as a share of home price also grew. Since 2013, the average annual share of down payment was 11.39%, but that number climbed after the start of COVID to 12.75% and hit 14.71% in the third quarter, suggesting buyers are starting their homeownership with more equity in hand.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15351522/embed?auto=1></iframe>Today’s homebuyers have good reasons to bump up their stake in their new homes.

Under the same scenario but with a 15% down payment, the monthly payment would be reduced to $1,800.""It makes a lot of sense that buyers are trying to limit the amount of interest on their loan,"" Jones said.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/9011905/embed?auto=1></iframe>A changing buyer pool is another reason for increasing down payments.Homebuyers who can come up with enough cash to purchase in today’s market are not your traditional buyers. The majority of them are repeat buyers with carryover equity, higher-income households, or ones with access to large down payment.""Buyers who are participating perhaps have a lot of money, they can put more down from a previous home sale,"" Jones said. ""Otherwise they are not so worried about the budget side of the equation.""""Almost like a biased sample,"" Jones said.On average, repeat buyers contributed 17% of the purchase price toward their down payment, whereas first-time buyers put down 6% on average, according to the National Association of Realtors’ 2022 Profile of Homebuyers and Sellers. While repeat buyers have always been the majority of the buyer pool, their share has grown to 75% in 2022 — or nearly three in four buyers. This is a significant growth compared to the historical average of 61.5% from 1981 to 2021.The number of first-time buyers has shrunk below historical averages, hitting 26% last year — an all-time low. In August, first-time buyers made up only 29% of all sales, well below the long-term average.Read more: First-time homebuyer in 2023: What you need to knowProspective buyers that intend to buy for the first time typically have lower incomes than repeat buyers (the median first-timer reports a household income of $75,000 to $79,999, versus $125,000 to $149,999 for prospective repeat buyers), according to Zillow’s Consumer Housing Trends Report 2023.""Today's market is so expensive and so challenging to compete in it,"" Jones said.<img alt=""Many first-time homebuyers are edged out of today&#39;s real estate market as down payment increases."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0sZwAQXcOXCQyWOEnvNhcA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/bfb616f0-74d1-11ea-bfa7-8583e73a9375 class=caas-img>Many first-time homebuyers are edged out of today's real estate market as down payments increase.The same report also shows that the higher the income, the higher the success rate of landing a home purchase. The percentage of successful homebuyers is 42% for households earning $100,000 or more, 27% for households earning $50,000 to $99,999, and 19% for families making less than $50,000.Some younger homebuyers also are getting a leg up by getting money from family or other loved ones. A recent LendingTree report found that 78% of Gen Z and 54% of millennial homeowners received some type of financial assistance for down payment.""There's just no getting around how expensive houses are right now,"" Jacob Channel, LendingTree’s senior economist and report author, told Yahoo Finance. ""And because of that there's more incentive for people to say to a parent or somebody like that, 'I'd really like to buy a house but it's so prohibitively expensive, I need some help.'""These type of buyers are edging out potential first-time buyers who have limited means and a smaller down payment. The share of first-time buyers dropped to 29% in August from 30% a month ago. This is just 3 percentage points higher than November 2022’s tracking at 26%, the lowest level recorded since NAR data collection began.""We are not seeing that lower side of down payment because those buyers just can't play ball at all,"" Jones said.Rebecca Chen is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and previously worked as an investment tax certified public accountant (CPA).Click here for real estate and housing market news, reports, and analysis to inform your investing decisions."

And even in December chances are shrinking that the Fed will raise rates then.

Pras Subramanian,"EV sales hit new record in Q3 as Tesla market share dips
Though Tesla easily sells the most EVs, it is losing market share to rivals.","The electric vehicle transformation in the US hit yet another milestone last quarter, though further growth into the mainstream may still be elusive. This as Tesla’s lead at the top is narrowing.According to automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book (KBB), US EV sales in the third quarter crossed 313,000, nearly a 50% increase from a year ago, and around 15,000 more than the 298,000 sold in Q2. Cox Automotive (KBB's parent company) said EV market share hit 7.9%, its highest ever level and up from the 6.1% recorded a year ago.""Higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the US market,"" said Jonathan Smoke, Cox Automotive's chief economist.Three years ago, total EV sales for the year passed 250,000, and KBB says this year EV sales are on pace to top 1 million. KBB also noted 14 new EV models were now in the mix, and automakers like Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes, and Hyundai saw EV sales gains of over 200%, though at limited quantities.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15340446/embed?auto=1></iframe>Of course the 800-pound gorilla in the room is Tesla, which sold over 150,000 EVs in the US, exactly half (50%) of the total amount sold. While a huge amount, Tesla’s share of the pie has been shrinking lately, with 50% its lowest level on record, and down from 62% a year ago.Though Tesla’s market share is slipping, its overall sales volume is increasing — up 19.5% year over year and beating the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%, KBB said.Coinciding with Tesla’s jump in overall sales have been its price cuts, which the company has been implementing aggressively over the past year or so. “In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped,” KBB noted in its report.Ford has also cut prices on its Mustang Mach-E SUV, and Ford Lightning EV pickup; however, big picture in the US at least, EVs are still relatively expensive, and that’s a major concern for consumers. KBB reports that the ATP (average transaction price) of an EV was $50,683, down a considerable amount from the $65,000 a year ago, but still more than gas-powered cars, which can still be had for under $30,000.Story continuesYahoo Finance noted this concern in our EV sentiment poll conducted with Ipsos, which found 70% of respondents were worried about overall cost of EVs, among other concerns.Tesla for its part has been trying to make EVs cheaper, with CEO Elon Musk claiming market share gains were more important than preserving Tesla’s industry best margins, which were once above 20%. That being said, without more sub-$40,000 EVs like Tesla’s Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt, the industry might struggle to hit a 10% EV market share, let alone 20% nationally.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Its revenue of $40.7 billion was up 21%. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street expectations.CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release that US consumers and businesses ""generally remain healthy"" but noted a number of economic risks, including the possibility that inflation remains elevated and interest rates continue to rise.Wars in Ukraine and Israel, he added, could also impact energy, food markets, global trade and geopolitical relationships.""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" he said.<img alt=""WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 22: JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon arrives for a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill September 22, 2022 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Profits at Wells Fargo were up 61% from a year ago and 2% at Citigroup. Profits fell at a regional bank, PNC (PNC), a sign that smaller lenders are having a tougher time churning out higher results.The stocks of JPM, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were all higher Friday morning, while PNC fell.The results kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show how they are navigating an extended period of high interest rates that is proving to be one of the most challenging for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its dominance during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13403070/embed?auto=1></iframe>A focus for many investors in the coming weeks will be what banks say about a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay for deposits.Story continuesJPMorgan's net interest income of $22.9 billion beat expectations. It was up 5% from the last quarter and 30% jump from the same period a year ago. Excluding its purchase of First Republic, the figure was up 21%.It also raised expectations for full year net interest income to between $88.5-$89 billion.Wells Fargo’s net interest income topped Wall Street expectations and it also raised its full-year guidance.Citigroup also showed improvement in its investment-banking fees, which were up 34% from a year ago. That bodes well for some other giant banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) that are heavily reliant on dealmaking for their revenues.JPMorgan’s investment-banking fees were down 3% from a year ago but up 10% from the second quarter.These giant banks are certainly not immune from some of the challenges roiling the industry. JPMorgan took $1.5 billion in write-offs for bad loans this quarter, more than double the amount compared to the year ago period.That is a sign that consumers and businesses are having more problems paying their debts.However, the bank also set aside less to cover future loan losses, a sign that it may have more confidence about the future.Another challenge that JPMorgan noted Friday was how it will be affected by a new set of capital requirements recently proposed by US regulators. It said that the new rules will increased the amount of capital it will have to set aside by 25%, or $500 billion.That is higher than the 19% regulators said would likely apply to the largest banks. That 19%, the bank said in a presentation, ""does not tell the full story"" and it believes that ""increases of this magnitude are not warranted.""""There is a lot that does not make sense to us,"" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts Friday.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley,Microsoft closes $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard,"Microsoft (MSFT) on Friday finalized its $69 billion purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI), according to a regulatory filing from the company Friday, in what is the largest-ever merger for the gaming market.The deal closed Friday after Microsoft cleared a final hurdle from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

In its initial objection to the deal, the CMA said the acquisition threatened to ""alter the future of the fast-growing cloud gaming market."" The impact on cloud gaming, the CMA said at the time, could lead to ""reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come.""In its original complaint, the FTC said that Microsoft's ownership of Activision ""would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.""Story continuesUS District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the agency’s request to hold up the deal.""The FTC has not shown it is likely to succeed on its assertion the combined firm will probably pull 'Call of Duty' from Sony PlayStation or that its ownership of Activision content will substantially lessen competition in the video game library subscription and cloud gaming markets,"" Corley said.Brian Quinn, a Boston College Law School professor, said the FTC can continue to fight the deal after it closes, though courts generally shy away from unraveling integrated companies.""The FTC’s been down that road,"" Quinn said. ""The remedies available include taking apart the merged companies, and that's also the remedy that nobody wants to do.

The game series earns Activision Blizzard billions each year, with the latest installment, 2022's ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,"" clearing $1 billion in sales in its first 10 days on the market.To assuage the US’s and other regulators' concerns that Microsoft would abuse the deal to wall off ""Call of Duty"" from its rivals, the company has signed agreements with Nintendo, Nvidia, and, most recently, Sony, ensuring the game is available on their respective gaming consoles for at least 10 years.Microsoft says it intends to bring ""Call of Duty"" and Activision Blizzard's other franchises including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Diablo"" to its Xbox Game Pass cloud gaming platform. The move will give Microsoft a huge boost in the still nascent cloud gaming wars, drawing more gamers to its subscription offering.The service, which costs $15 per month to access Microsoft's cloud gaming service as well as the ability to download games to your console or PC, is well ahead of rival platforms Sony, Nvidia, and Amazon thanks to its wide array of games and ease of use.Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
David Hollerith,Giant banks show resilience as profits surge,"Profits for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) rose in the third quarter, a show of strength by the largest banks despite headwinds faced by many of their smaller rivals this year.JPMorgan, the country's largest lender, reported earnings of $13.2 billion that were up 35% from the same period a year ago. Its revenue of $40.7 billion was up 21%. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street expectations.CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release that US consumers and businesses ""generally remain healthy"" but noted a number of economic risks, including the possibility that inflation remains elevated and interest rates continue to rise.Wars in Ukraine and Israel, he added, could also impact energy, food markets, global trade and geopolitical relationships.""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" he said.<img alt=""WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 22: JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon arrives for a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill September 22, 2022 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Profits at Wells Fargo were up 61% from a year ago and 2% at Citigroup. Profits fell at a regional bank, PNC (PNC), a sign that smaller lenders are having a tougher time churning out higher results.The stocks of JPM, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were all higher Friday morning, while PNC fell.The results kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show how they are navigating an extended period of high interest rates that is proving to be one of the most challenging for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its dominance during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13403070/embed?auto=1></iframe>A focus for many investors in the coming weeks will be what banks say about a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay for deposits.Story continuesJPMorgan's net interest income of $22.9 billion beat expectations. It was up 5% from the last quarter and 30% jump from the same period a year ago. Excluding its purchase of First Republic, the figure was up 21%.It also raised expectations for full year net interest income to between $88.5-$89 billion.Wells Fargo’s net interest income topped Wall Street expectations and it also raised its full-year guidance.Citigroup also showed improvement in its investment-banking fees, which were up 34% from a year ago. That bodes well for some other giant banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) that are heavily reliant on dealmaking for their revenues.JPMorgan’s investment-banking fees were down 3% from a year ago but up 10% from the second quarter.These giant banks are certainly not immune from some of the challenges roiling the industry. JPMorgan took $1.5 billion in write-offs for bad loans this quarter, more than double the amount compared to the year ago period.That is a sign that consumers and businesses are having more problems paying their debts.However, the bank also set aside less to cover future loan losses, a sign that it may have more confidence about the future.Another challenge that JPMorgan noted Friday was how it will be affected by a new set of capital requirements recently proposed by US regulators. It said that the new rules will increased the amount of capital it will have to set aside by 25%, or $500 billion.That is higher than the 19% regulators said would likely apply to the largest banks. That 19%, the bank said in a presentation, ""does not tell the full story"" and it believes that ""increases of this magnitude are not warranted.""""There is a lot that does not make sense to us,"" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts Friday.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
Hamza Shaban,The Fed's next 'rate hike' has already arrived,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsAnother interest rate increase is creeping its way through the economy. But this time it didn’t come from the Federal Reserve. Spooky season is upon us, and so is the phantom rate hike.The recent surge in Treasury yields has unleashed an array of anxiety goblins, from fears of a stock market slump to worries about ballooning interest payments on government debt.But policymakers also see rising yields as a way to slow the economy without having to go through the trouble of raising rates again.In effect, elevated yields can do the work of central bankers for them — functioning as a rate hike without instituting an actual rate hike.This isn't the only time recently where we've seen a phantom rate hike. In March Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the bank failures and associated turmoil essentially acted as another rate hike.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsLong-term Treasury yields have a direct influence on households and businesses. They impact the cost of mortgages, car loans, and taking on other types of debt. So increasing yields have a tightening effect, slowing economic activity.Though it's receded this week, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) has risen to levels last seen in 2007, climbing roughly 30 basis points since the Fed’s meeting in September.Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson pointed to the rise in yields and their impact in a speech earlier this week, pledging to ""remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields ... as I assess the future path of policy.""Jefferson said that the Fed is in a particularly sensitive period of managing risk, having to balance between the twin risks of too loose and too tight.Story continuesOther Fed officials have chimed in on the bond market acting like a pinch-hitter.“We're just kind of keeping a very close eye on that, and then we'll see how these higher rates feed into what we're trying to do in policy,” said Fed Governor Chris Waller on Wednesday.But as with the Fed’s previous rate increases, a rise in inflation or other unfavorable observations could force the central bank to move. And if yields slide, their tightening effect would diminish, creating a greater need for the Fed to enact a genuine hike instead of relying on a substitute.There’s a circular logic to all of this, which means it can turn on a dime.As Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said earlier this week, it’s possible higher bond yields will mean less work for the Fed. But if those yields are higher because the market’s expectations for the Fed are changing, the Fed might have to follow through on those expectations to keep those yields high.In other words, there's a wobbly Jenga tower of expectations.“It’s hard for me to say definitively that because they moved, we don’t have to move,” Kashkari said. “I don’t know yet.”For now, as some Fed officials think the focus of the tightening campaign should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels, the latest data might support more of a let-the-bond-market-do-the-work approach.While the likelihood of a rate hike next month has fallen, that may be because one has already come through. It just didn’t come from the Fed.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Brooke DiPalma,"Halloween spending expected to hit record high as sugar prices continue to rise
Consumer spending on candy, costumes, and decorations is projected to top $11 billion.","Getting a sugar rush is becoming more expensive, but that hasn't spooked enthusiastic Halloween fans.In September, the cost of sugar and sugar substitutes is up 7.7% compared to a year ago, while candy and chewing gum jumped 7.5%. Prices of other sweets rose nearly 3% compared to last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) latest Consumer Price Index (CPI).On a yearly basis, the overall sugar and sweets category rose 6.5%, including a 0.3% jump compared to the month prior.That's higher than overall food inflation, which increased 0.2% in September on a monthly basis and 3.7% year over year. The cost of groceries — food at home — jumped 0.1% and 2.4%, respectively.But fret not, trick-or-treaters. Consumers are expected to spend $3.6 billion dollars on candy this year, a nearly 14% jump from last year's total of $3.1 billion. That figure is an all-time high, according to the National Retail Federation. And nearly three-fourths of Americans, 73%, are expected to participate in Halloween festivities, higher than 69% last year.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15339503/embed?auto=1></iframe>Extreme weather is driving prices higherSugar futures (SB=F) are up 40% compared to a year ago.""A lot of that increase that you're seeing is attributed to what the world's supply is going to look like,"" Andraia Torsiello, Mintec US sugar analyst, told Yahoo Finance over the phone. ""India is actually a major exporter and they've had really poor weather conditions, so they're suffering from a really dry monsoon period.""It's partly the result of a climate pattern known as an El Niño over Asia, David Branch of Wells Fargo told Yahoo Finance over the phone: ""It's impacting India, Thailand, and Australia too.""As a result, ""India and Thailand did not get the monsoons they normally get,"" Branch said, which led to both governments basically shutting down exports.Last year, the growth rate of US sugar exports also dropped by 2.38%, per the USDA. Story continues""The reason why the prices are high and remain high is not only because of the inflation in the economy, but also just the supply not being as available as it was,"" Torsiello said.Another factor behind the rise: the cost of cocoa. Cocoa futures (CC=F) are up 46%.""There's a significant shortage of cocoa due to drought in those specific regions,"" Branch said, which spells bad news for candymakers. ""I imagine that's a bigger chunk of the total cost of manufacturing than sugar.""<img alt=""WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 17: Halloween candy is for sale at a Harris Teeter grocery store on October 17, 2022 in Washington, DC.

""We met all our commitments to retailers, and even ended up being able to exceed the amount of candy we committed to in some cases,"" a spokesperson said.Consumers are leaning in too.

Josh Schafer,Fed can stay 'patient' after inflation data as odds rise on a December rate hike,"Thursday's inflation report showed prices in September rose at roughly the same pace seen in August.But when removing volatile categories like food, energy, and shelter, economists see a downward trend in price increases, a welcomed sign for a Federal Reserve that had spent the days ahead of this data indicating a bias against raising interest rates again in November.Still, this data shows the Fed has work to do in bringing inflation back to its 2% target, keeping the possibility of an interest rate increase in December in focus for investors.As of Thursday morning, markets were pricing in a 12% chance the Fed hikes in November, down from a 41% chance a month ago, data from the CME Group showed. The chances of a December rate hike rose, however, to 37% from 26% following the September inflation reading.""The underlying trend in inflation is still down,"" wrote Michael Pearce, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, in reaction to Thursday's release.

This, the officials said, could lead to the Fed not raising rates in November.""The downward trend in inflation remains in place, in our view,"" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote on Thursday. ""In addition to shelter disinflation likely to resume, easing supply chain pressures, slower wage growth and more price-sensitive consumers should help inflation continue to settle down.""Story continuesBut some economists see September marking three straight months of headline inflation not moving lower — while core inflation decreases stagnate — challenging the view the Fed is done for the year.""We are not sure if there is enough time for the Fed to re-pivot before the next FOMC meeting on November 1, but this certainly increases the risk that Powell supercharges his hawkish rhetoric at the press conference, and increases market expectations for a rate hike in December,"" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.<img alt=""WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 20: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference after a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 20, 2023 at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC.

While the top selling F-150 was spared, Ford says Kentucky Truck plant is responsible for $25 billion in revenue annually.The UAW said in a statement the strike at Kentucky Truck was called after Ford “refused to make further movement in bargaining,” marking a new phase for the stand up strikes. “If they can’t understand that after four weeks, the 8,700 workers shutting down this extremely profitable plant will help them understand it,” Fain said.Ford’s response came quickly on Wednesday night: the automaker called the UAW’s latest move “grossly irresponsible,” but not surprising. The strike at Kentucky Truck “carries serious consequences for our workforce, suppliers, dealers and commercial customers,” the company added.The UAW has 8,700 workers at Kentucky Truck. But Ford officials said the ripple effect from Kentucky Truck will impact dozens of of other Ford operations and suppliers, which employ around 100,000 workers.The financial impact, and pain point created by this move, is a big one.“Targeting Ford's Kentucky truck plant hits some of the most expensive products they make, including the SuperDuty, which sells for as much as a $100,000,” Sam Fiorani, auto industry expert at AutoForecast Solutions (AFS), told Yahoo Finance. “Expanding the strike to include this facility is meant to force Ford's hand and bring them to the table quicker.”Fiorani, who’s firm tracks auto production and plant productivity across the globe, says profits on vehicles at Kentucky Truck can easily top $10,000 per unit, making them among the most important in Ford's product portfolio.“It is also a shot across the industry to tell GM and Stellantis to step up their game or else their big and profitable models would be targeted next,” Fiorani said.<img alt=""Josh Schafer"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/jE5SMvNNl.aUDcRnQKD9Bg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Y2M9ODY0MDA7cT04NTtmaT1zdHJpbTtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTQwO2g9MTQw/https://avatars.scribblelive.com/2023/6/14/5a68059b-4722-4ae2-bc99-b1f34baa3286.png"" class=""caas-img"">J7 days agoJosh SchaferSeptember inflation report shows Fed can 'remain patient'Thursday's inflation report came in slightly hotter than projected.

Kerry Hannon,Social Security benefits will increase 3.2% next year,"The increase in Social Security benefits next year will exceed the 20-year average, but it still pales in comparison to this year’s boost.The Social Security Administration, the federal government agency that oversees the benefits, announced a 3.2% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2024. That’s well above the 2.6% average over the past two decades, but it’s less than half the 8.7% increase retirees saw in 2023, which was the biggest in four decades.The increase will add more than $50 to the average monthly benefit of $1,848 starting in January, according to the SSA.Read more: How to find out your 2024 Social Security COLA increaseThe adjustment will provide some comfort to the more than 70 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who have faced higher prices this year, but it may not be enough to alleviate retirees' ongoing budget concerns.""This COLA might disappoint Social Security beneficiaries after last year’s adjustment,"" Emerson Sprick, senior economic analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told Yahoo Finance. ""But it actually suggests that macroeconomic conditions are improving in a way that likely benefits seniors’ household finances. It goes without saying that having stable prices is highly preferable to having large COLAs.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/10885096/embed?auto=1></iframe>The COLA is calculated by averaging together the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for July, August, and September and then comparing that figure with the same data last year. On Thursday, government data showed inflation rose 0.4% over last month and 3.7% over the prior year in September.In general, people who receive Social Security benefits are notified by mail in early December about their new benefit amount. Most beneficiaries can also view their COLA notice online through their personal Social Security account at socialsecurity.gov/myaccount.The once-a-year inflation adjustment began in 1975 under a formula made into law by Congress. And it significantly contributes to helping beneficiaries shoulder increasing day-to-day living costs.Story continues""Of course, inflation isn’t uniform across the US or the same for every person,"" Sprick said. ""Beneficiaries in regions that have seen higher inflation will lose some purchasing power while those in low-inflation areas will gain some purchasing power. But on average, the annual COLA ensures that a retiree’s benefit amount has the same purchasing power year after year.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/6180194/embed?auto=1></iframe>Still, older adults remain pessimistic about their finances in coming months and the growing potential of Social Security benefit cuts, according to a new retirement survey by The Senior Citizens League. More than two-thirds report that their household expenses remain at least 10% higher than one year ago, the survey found.Worry that retirement income won’t be enough to cover the cost of essentials in the coming months is a top concern for 56% of survey respondents.""Even though the rate of inflation has come down, prices are still that much higher than one year ago, and retirement incomes aren’t keeping up,"" Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League, told Yahoo Finance.The survey was conducted from January through Sept. 7, 2023, and included 2,258 participants.Social Security is the most common source of retirement income for retirees. However, fewer retirees who do not have additional income – from retirement accounts, pensions, income from a job or interest and dividends on investments – feel like they are doing OK financially versus those who do, according to a report released in May from the Federal Reserve Board.<img alt=""(Getty Creative)"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IHmmKQAwZ9SzmCtZehRQag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/b18f78e0-687b-11ee-9fef-844f7581be0f class=caas-img>(Getty Creative)Rising costs for retirees’ budget next year may also be linked to Medicare premiums for 2024, which were announced Thursday by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Johnson added. The Social Security Administration automatically deducts Medicare Part B premiums from Social Security benefits before the benefits are received.Medicare Part B covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, durable medical equipment, and certain other medical and health services not covered by Medicare Part A, which covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility, hospice, lab tests, surgery, and home health care.The 2024 standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will be $174.70 for 2024, an increase of $9.80 from $164.90 in 2023. The annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will be $240 in 2024, an increase of $14 from the annual deductible of $226 in 2023.And there’s an additional worry for retirees' budgets.""When incomes grow like they did this year with an 8.7% COLA, more older taxpayers pay tax on a bigger portion of their Social Security benefits, and we expect this trend to continue in 2024,"" Johnson said.About a quarter ( 26%) of The Senior Citizens League survey participants who have received Social Security for more than three years report paying taxes on a portion of their benefits for the first time during the 2023 tax season (for tax year 2022).""Because Social Security recipients received an even higher COLA of 8.7% in 2023, we expect more beneficiaries to become liable for federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits for the first time in the upcoming 2024 tax season,"" Johnson said.Kerry Hannon is a Senior Reporter and Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Hamza Shaban,Inflation is higher than the Fed wants. The problem could be its target.,"With a singular focus the Federal Reserve has struggled to pull inflation down to its 2% target. By its own forecasts, US central bankers won’t complete the mission until 2026. The dedication to a yearslong journey has cemented the idea that rates will stay higher for longer or that even more drastic rate hikes — and possibly a recession — will be required to achieve an elusive 2%.While reaching that goal has long been entrenched in the Fed’s mission and public commitments, the costs of doing so have invited some calls to aim for a more realistic goal, fit for the current moment: raising the inflation target.The main argument for upping the desired rate boils down to the difficulty in trying to get down to 2%. Fed officials would have to knock the economy so forcefully, the thinking goes, they would likely spark a recession to get there — as stubborn winds blow in the face of its inflation fight.But central bankers have resisted such calls, with one Fed official even saying the implications could be disastrous.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/14160530/embed?auto=1></iframe>Formalized more than a decade ago, the 2% target has become entwined with the Fed’s mandate to ensure price stability. It’s a Goldilocks number that’s palatable enough for consumers and businesses but not low enough to trigger deflation.But the number itself is more a convention than economic canon.“The Fed wants to be sure that there isn't too much inflation, which makes it tough for consumers to live their lives and pay their bills, but the Fed also doesn't want deflation, where prices are declining, because deflation can slow the economy,” said Jason Betz, a private wealth adviser at Ameriprise Financial. “The 2% target is the sweet spot level for the Fed.”Stash Graham, managing director at Graham Capital Wealth Management, said the primary criticism of the inflation goal is that 2% is a long-term target that might not be realistic for the near-term time horizon. While rate hikes have cooled demand in many areas of the economy, supply-related shocks that are beyond the control of the central bank are reverberating. From the escalating violence in Gaza, which could trigger a broader conflict, to ongoing labor strikes, there’s a host of issues that could prevent the Fed from reaching its target.Story continuesMarket observers who have argued for the Fed to tweak its target contend that a goal higher than the current 2% would give the central bank more flexibility. With added breathing room the Fed wouldn't have to keep raising rates or keep them as high for longer. And the economic pain that comes with rate hikes — from job losses to more expensive household borrowing to sluggish growth — wouldn’t be as acute.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/14079124/embed?auto=1></iframe>Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard who served as a top economist in the Obama administration, argued in a recent op-ed that the Fed should move to a higher target range when it updates its overall strategy around 2025.But Fed officials have long pushed back on moving the goalpost. When the question was posed directly to Chair Powell last year, he offered a resounding dismissal.""We're not considering that. We're not going to consider that. Under any circumstances,"" he said in December.Testifying in front of the Senate Banking Committee in March, he elaborated on staying firm. ""We think it's really important that we do stick to a 2% inflation target and not consider changing it,"" Powell told lawmakers. “The modern belief is that people's expectations about inflation actually have a real effect on inflation. If you expect inflation to go up 5% then it will,"" he said.Powell’s remarks highlight a credibility problem of altering the inflation target. A change risks unsettling expectations about future price increases, which influences the actual rate of inflation.<img alt=""WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 20: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference after a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 20, 2023 at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)“They already cost themselves credibility by trying to convince us that inflation was transitory,” said Russell Hackmann, president of Hackmann Wealth Partners LLC. Changing the inflation target all of a sudden, he said, would be akin to “the kid who grades his own homework.”But a big-picture review of the Fed’s inflation goal is still a possibility, as even Powell has acknowledged. “There may be a longer-run project at some point,” he has said.Other critics of the powerful role of central banks have pushed for a bigger overhaul, questioning the heavy reliance on what they see as an imprecise lever of roundabout rate setting.Joshua Ryan-Collins, an economics professor at UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, said the paradigm of prior decades worked in an environment of low inflation and stable growth. But the disruptions unleashed by COVID and by the Russian invasion of Ukraine have shown that model is not sustainable. “If central banks really want to deal with modern-day inflation they have to rethink their approach on the drivers of inflation and worry less about the short-term demand side,” he said.

WAYNE PARRY,Coastal county and groups sue to overturn federal approval of New Jersey's 1st offshore wind farm,"OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) — The government of New Jersey's southernmost county has joined with environmental and fishing industry groups in suing the federal government in a bid to overturn its approval of the state's first offshore wind energy farm.Cape May County and the groups filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court against two federal agencies — the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management — seeking to reverse their approval of the Ocean Wind I project.Current plans call for construction of the project in waters off southern New Jersey by the Danish wind power company Orsted.The plaintiffs allege that the two agencies did not follow the requirements of nearly a dozen federal laws in approving the project, which would be built off the coast of Atlantic City and Ocean City — two of the state's top tourism destinations. They also claim the agencies did not adequately consider potential harm to the environment and marine life from offshore wind projects.“To implement a massive new program to generate electrical energy by constructing thousands of turbine towers offshore ... and laying hundreds of miles of high-tension electrical cables undersea, the United States has shortcut the statutory and regulatory requirements that were enacted to protect our nation’s environmental and natural resources, its industries, and its people,” the suit read.Both agencies declined comment Wednesday.Orsted declined comment on the lawsuit, but said it ""remains committed to collaboration with local communities, and will continue working to support New Jersey’s clean energy targets and economic development goals by bringing good-paying jobs and local investment to the Garden State.”The lawsuit is the latest challenge — legal and otherwise — to the nascent offshore wind industry in the Northeast, which is also facing rising costs and supply chain concerns in addition to political and residential opposition to its projects.Story continuesIn New Jersey alone, there have already been numerous lawsuits filed by and against Orsted over the project, as well as challenges by residents groups to various levels of federal and state approval of the project, which would built 98 wind turbines about 15 miles (24 kilometers) off the shoreline.A tax break New Jersey approved in July for Orsted has heightened opposition to the Orsted proposal and offshore wind in general.

Will Daniel,"If you’re in the 1% or middle class, inflation has actually made you richer, according to a top economist who’s been researching inequality for over 40 years","Throughout his career, famed economist Milton Friedman described inflation as a “hidden tax.” When prices rise consistently, he warned, they cut into consumers’ purchasing power, forcing them to earn more money (and pay more in taxes) to maintain the same lifestyle. On top of that, nominal wage and revenue increases during periods of high inflation can end up pushing an unlucky group of consumers and businesses into higher tax brackets even as their purchasing power falls—an effect called “bracket creep.”“Inflation is a form of taxation without representation. It is the kind of tax that can be imposed without being legislated by the authorities and without having to employ additional tax collectors,” Friedman famously wrote in a 1974 article that called for the indexing of tax brackets in order to prevent “bracket creep.”This so-called income-tax feature of inflation has made it incredibly unpopular among the public. As Tom Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, explained in a recent interview with CNN:“The one thing that I hear loud and clear from everybody is that they hate inflation. They find inflation to be unfair. You get a raise, and then you have to spend that raise at the gas station,” he said. “It’s frankly exhausting.”But now, new research has added a wrinkle to the popular view of inflation as nothing but a downer. In a new working paper whose title asks, “Is There Really an Inflation Tax?” New York University economist Edward Nathan Wolff, an expert on inequality with nearly 40 years of research to his name, breaks down the effects of inflation on Americans’ overall wealth between 1983 and 2019.His answer? The “inflation tax” does exist, but not for everybody. The middle class and the top 1% of Americans actually benefited from periods of high inflation in recent decades. “With regard to the issue of whether there is really a net inflation tax, the answer is that it is true for some groups only,” Wolff wrote.Story continuesA ‘tax’ that hits unequallyIn his paper, which was published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of business cycles, Wolff pored over data from the consumer price index and Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to measure changes in consumers’ incomes and overall wealth during periods of sustained inflation.The economist, who serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Economic Inequality and the Review of Income and Wealth, found that although there is definitely an “inflation tax” on consumers’ incomes—measured as the difference between nominal and real income growth—there’s another, more positive side to inflation as well. (Wolff’s books on inequality include 2015’s Inheriting Wealth in America: Future Boom or Bust? and 2017’s A Century of Wealth in America.)Inflation can cause asset prices, particularly in real estate, to rise substantially, while simultaneously lowering the real debt burdens of some consumers. This means that a lucky group of households that have a large amount of assets or debt relative to their incomes—say, recent homebuyers who are “house poor” or the ultrarich—have historically seen a sizable gain in household wealth thanks to inflation, Wolff explained.“In terms of household well-being, inflation is a net boon to the middle class. The top 1% of the wealth distribution also gains handsomely from inflation. On the other hand, poor households (the bottom two quintiles in terms of wealth) get clobbered by inflation,” he wrote.Comparing the difference between inflation’s erosion of incomes and its boost to wealth, Wolff calculated the “net inflation gain” or NIG for each income bracket in the U.S.The top 1% of Americans saw a “robust” NIG of $63,500, or 6.9% of their mean annual income between 1983 and 2019. However, for those who were merely very wealthy, but below the 1%, it was a different story.Those in the 95th to 99th percentile of wealth have a much lower wealth-to-income ratio, which caused their NIG to come in at -$56,200, or 18% of their mean income. NIG was also negative for Americans in the 80th to 95th percentile of wealth.The equation flips for the upper middle class, however. Americans in the 60th to 80th wealth percentile—today, that means a household net worth of roughly $200,000 to $550,000—tend to have a high portion of their wealth in real estate. As a result, for this group, inflation led to a NIG of $12,700, or 16% of their mean yearly income between 1983 and 2019. Essentially, inflation eroded these consumers’ mortgage payments and inflated their assets more than enough to make up for the losses their income took from having to pay more for other goods and services.The boost was even bigger for squarely middle-class households, or those in the 40th to 60th wealth percentile. This group saw an NIG of nearly $40,000, or two-thirds of their annual income. “Indeed, inflation has been a boon to the middle class in terms of its balance sheet,” Wolff wrote of the findings.For the bottom two quintiles of the wealth distribution, however, inflation remains a nightmare. Wolff found that this group’s NIG was -$19,300, or almost half of their mean income. “It is clear that poor households were particularly hard hit by inflation,” he wrote.Wolff said his findings pose an urgent question: “Why is the public, particularly the middle class, so opposed to inflation?”His answer was that consumers tend to feel the psychological effects caused by inflation eroding their incomes, but they are often “not aware” of the commonly positive effects that it can have on their assets and debt. It’s easy to see rising prices at the grocery store or while filling up at the gas station, but for many consumers, the positive wealth effect that comes from inflation lowering the lifetime real cost of a mortgage is less obvious.However, the Great Recession, the pandemic, and the dotcom bubble all helped push more Americans out of the middle class, at least in terms of income, over the past decades. Between 1971 and 2021, the number of “middle income” Americans fell from 61% to 50%, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. Part of the reason for this hollowing out of the middle class was a seven-percentage-point increase in the “upper income” category, but the amount of lower income Americans also grew by five percentage points—and many have blamed inflation for that outcome. A point that Wolff doesn’t touch on is that inflation is massively unpopular because the hidden tax is affecting more Americans who are missing out on entry into the middle class.Should the Fed be aiming at a higher inflation target?Overall, Wolff’s findings suggest that lower rates of inflation would protect poorer families, but also hurt the middle class, thereby (ironically) raising overall wealth inequality. This has implications for federal policy, and suggests, rather than the Federal Reserve’s longtime target of 2% inflation, it could make sense to have a slightly higher overall inflation target. Of course, that higher rate comes with its own issues for the poorest Americans.To combat the negative effect of inflation on the poor, Wolff proposed an interesting solution: an inflation tax credit. He argued that the IRS should calculate the rate of inflation in the preceding year and then use that figure to “modify the tax code” and offer incentives to those most affected by rising prices.“Varying this tax credit across the income distribution could reduce the burden of inflation for poor families while still allowing middle-income families to capture its benefits,” he wrote.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,A surge in wealth has boosted most US households since 2020 and helped sustain economic growth,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The net worth of the typical U.S. household grew at the fastest pace in more than three decades from 2020 through 2022, while relatively low interest rates at that time made it easier for households to pay their debts, according to a government report Wednesday.Wealth for the median household — the midpoint between the richest and poorest households — jumped 37% during those three years, the Federal Reserve reported, to nearly $193,000. (The figures are adjusted for inflation.) The increase reflected primarily a jump in home values and higher stock prices and a rise in the proportion of Americans who own homes and stocks.The jump in wealth occurred even as the brief but brutal pandemic recession cost 20 million Americans their jobs in 2020. Extensive government relief aid, totaling about $5 trillion, helped spur a rapid recovery that regained the lost jobs much faster than had been true after the 2008-2009 recession. The additional spending, though, is believed to have helped fuel the worst bout of inflation in four decades.The broad-based wealth increase helps explain the surprising durability of the U.S. economy this year and the consumer spending that powers about two-thirds of it. For at least a year, economists have been warning of a forthcoming recession. Yet the economy has kept chugging along.Economic growth in the just-completed July-September quarter might have topped a robust 4% annual rate, boosted by strong consumer spending for physical goods as well as for services, a broad category that includes airline travel, entertainment, restaurant meals and other experiences.Government-provided stimulus payments in the aftermath of the pandemic also boosted households' finances. The median value of checking and savings accounts and other cash holdings surged 30%, according to the Fed's survey, which it conducts every three years. And with borrowing rates historically low, Americans dedicated just 13.4% of their incomes to paying off debt in 2022, the lowest such proportion since the Fed survey began in 1989.Story continuesEven so, substantial wealth inequality remained in place during the survey period, reflecting decades of widening disparities between the richest households and everyone else. Among the wealthiest 10% of households, median wealth reached nearly $3.8 million in 2022.Still, more Americans bought individual stocks after the pandemic — a likely reflection, in some way, of the “meme stock” craze that was fueled partly by stimulus checks. The proportion of families that directly owned stocks — as opposed through mutual funds — jumped from 15% to 21%, a record increase, the survey found.The median value of individual stock holdings was $15,000, the Fed report said. The average value of direct stock ownership was much higher — $404,000 — the survey found, reflecting the holdings of richer families.Household net worth rose more, on a percentage basis, for Black and Hispanic households than for white ones, though measured in dollar terms the disparities remained wide. The median net worth of Black households jumped 60% but remained comparatively low at $45,000. For Hispanics, the figure surged 47% to nearly $62,000. Among white households, median household net worth rose 31% to $285,000.The Fed’s survey found that even as wealth inequality declined, income disparities worsened. Median incomes grew 3% compared with the previous survey, which covered 2017 through 2019. But average incomes, which are swollen by the earnings of the wealthiest one-tenth of households, jumped 15%. The outsize gain among the richest households was driven by profits on stock and property holdings as well as higher wages.Yet the income data was also more complicated than usual in this report, Fed officials noted. It did not, for example, capture the effects of stimulus checks. And the report focused on incomes in 2021, when many Americans were still grappling with job losses from the pandemic recession.Other economic research has found that since the pandemic struck in 2020, wages have actually grown faster for lower-income workers than for wealthier ones. That reflects the fact that restaurants, hotels, warehouses and many other service businesses dramatically raised pay to try to attract desperately needed workers.A March 2023 research paper by David Autor, an economist at MIT; Arindrajit Dube, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and Anne McGrew, a Ph.D. student at UMass, found that rising wages for the lowest-paid one-tenth of workers from 2019 to 2022 managed to reverse one-quarter of the increase in income inequality since 1980."
Alice Gledhill and Sujata Rao,Apollo’s Slok Sees More Economic Hardship as US Defaults Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has a clear message for investors: interest rate-hikes are working and policymakers want you to shelter in risk-free assets.Most Read from BloombergBiden Vows Aid for Gaza, Backs Israel Over Hospital BlastHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameStocks Drop, Oil Climbs on Renewed Mideast Risks: Markets WrapUPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastEvidence of an economic slowdown is piling up, and that’s exactly what central bankers in the US and Europe want, he says, pointing to rising delinquency rates on credit card loans, junk-bond defaults, a rapid slowdown in banking lending and softer labor markets.It marks a regime shift from the era of easy money, when the Federal Reserve was effectively telling investors to bypass Treasuries for stocks and low-rated credit. Now, it’s thrown that process into reverse, a process that investors should be wary of fighting, Slok added.“Now Powell is saying, I’m going to increase the risk-free rate more and more, because the Fed wants to pull dollars out of risky assets in order to lower inflation,” he said. “There’s a competition for dollars and the risk-free rate is attracting more money from investors.”In his view, the economy has been resilient because higher-income households are being supported by the vast savings accumulated during the pandemic. A US retail sales report on Tuesday that topped expectations sparked a selloff in global stocks on concern that strong consumer spending means the Fed will have to hold rates higher for longer.Against that backdrop, it’s time to shift money into higher-quality assets like floating-rate, short-dated corporate bonds, Slok said. He also expects further inflows into money markets funds, which invest in safe short-dated assets like government bills.He also warned about neglecting credit risk analysis in the pursuit of juicy yields. A Bloomberg Global High Yield index is trading above 9.80%, more than double the low it reached in mid 2021.Story continues“Credit investors are not compensated appropriately for the risk of buying the high yield index,” he said. “The risk is that it’s going to be cheaper in six months time. That is why investors need to go up in quality to protect themselves.”In equity markets, strong earnings from a handful of companies, what Slok refers to as the “S&P 7” that includes stocks like Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc., are obscuring weakness in the rest of the index, or the “S&P 493.”“Fed policy is working exactly as the textbook would have predicted,” he said. “Consumers and firms are falling behind on their payments and it is beginning to bite.”Meanwhile in rates markets, Slok warned investors should heed the actions by central banks and stick to shorter maturities. Two-year Treasuries have been yielding around 5% for more than three months, in contrast to a violent selloff at the longer end of the curve.“If there’s one thing investors know for sure, it is that the Fed is saying rates are going to be higher for longer,” he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJeep’s Jump to $100,000 SUVs Risks Leaving Loyal Buyers BehindThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal Again©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Julie Hyman,Why you shouldn't listen to Jamie Dimon,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsEarlier in the week, Jamie Dimon got our attention by calling this perhaps “the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.”And that may be true, from a geopolitical perspective. Wars are now raging in both Ukraine and Israel, with broader implications. Dimon also pointed to the risks of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program at a time when inflation is persisting.As my colleague Brian Sozzi wrote this week, when one of the most powerful CEOs in the world makes a dramatic comment like that, you take notice.But in markets, it’s always a good idea to think about how someone may be talking his book.“For Jamie Dimon — for a bank that has strongly outperformed its peers, it’s a matter really of trying to lower expectations,” Ken Leon, a veteran bank analyst at CFRA, told Yahoo Finance Live. “That’s always his mission, to lower the bar, because it’s the one bank every quarter that outperforms and delivers across all the lines of business.” (JPM happens to be one of Leon’s top picks).And if you tune Dimon out, there are quite a few reassuring signals.Take Tuesday’s retail sales report, which came in double economists’ estimates. While it could put pressure on the Fed to raise rates once again, central bank officials have presented a remarkably consistent message over the past couple of weeks: They are willing to be patient, and higher Treasury yields are helping tighten financial conditions without them having to further raise rates at this time.Spurred by that retail sales data, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast now stands at 5.4% annualized growth for the third quarter. The S&P 500 has bounced back by more than 3% since early October. Early earnings from the big banks and the likes of Johnson & Johnson have beat estimates.Story continuesBank of America’s weekly fund flows data showed an 11th straight week of inflows into equities, with buyers favoring cyclicals over defensives — implying optimism about economic growth.Maybe investors should pay attention to what Dimon said after his warning: “While we hope for the best, we prepare the Firm for a broad range of outcomes so we can consistently deliver for clients no matter the environment.”In other words, while there appear to be positive signs for the economy and markets, it never hurts to be prepared for anything.<img alt=""morning brief image"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XHcvRRyUwTAVsA6.w0XlUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b99a27b0-d942-11ed-bfe1-d845793f82c4 class=caas-img>morning brief imageClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
Rich Miller,Wall Street Concerns Over Swelling US Debt Put Fed in Tight Spot,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve faces potential policy pitfalls ahead as it wrestles with how to respond to investor angst about the US government’s $33.5 trillion mountain of debt.Most Read from BloombergBiden Vows Aid for Gaza, Backs Israel Over Hospital BlastHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameStocks Drop, Oil Climbs on Renewed Mideast Risks: Markets WrapUPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastConcerns about America’s fiscal future have already contributed to a run-up in US bond yields that has surprised policymakers and prompted them to consider postponing for now plans for another interest-rate increase.Worries on Wall Street about the US budgetary morass pose risks to both sides of the central bank’s dual mandate.The disquiet over deficits and debt puts upward pressure on long-term interest rates, threatening to slow growth and push up unemployment. At the same time, it can also act as kindling for higher inflation, especially if the Fed is perceived as downplaying its goal of price stability in order to limit the federal government’s borrowing costs.“We are witnessing the beginning of a regime change in how investors perceive America’s fiscal sustainability,” said former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, who was an adviser to President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2006.To be sure, there are other forces at play behind a downdraft in bond prices that has driven the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 4.83% yesterday from this year’s low of 3.31% on April 6. Prime among them: the resilience of the US economy in the face of the most aggressive credit-tightening campaign by the Fed in decades.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will weigh in with his views in an appearance before the Economic Club of New York Thursday.Fed watchers expect him to tacitly back an emerging consensus among policymakers that the higher yields give them a chance to hold policy steady at their Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting as they assess the outlook.Story continuesBut with inflation still running faster than the Fed’s 2% objective, Powell will likely hold out the possibility of a rate increase later in the year.What Bloomberg Economics Says...The recent surge in 10-year Treasury yields will dampen economic growth, similar to a Fed rate hike. Bloomberg Economics estimates the increase since the Sept. 19-20 FOMC meeting, if sustained, should reduce the need for 50 basis points of interest rates.—Anna Wong, chief US economistTo read the full note, click here“The threat of another hike will remain with us as long as we’re approaching inflation from so far above their target,” MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC founder and former Fed economist Julia Coronado said.Ex-Fed Vice Chair Donald Kohn said that in general, Powell and other officials should speak out about the impact of fiscal policy on the economy, interest rates and the central bank.“It would help the economic conversation in the country if they at least talked about the consequences for monetary policy and the economy,” said Kohn, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Former Treasury official Mark Sobel — who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations — is blunter. Fed officials need to warn the public about the potentially deleterious impact of US profligacy on markets and the economy, said Sobel, who’s US chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a research organization.It’s been conventional wisdom for a while that the federal budget is on an unsustainable path of mushrooming debt. But a confluence of recent events has pushed those concerns to the forefront.QuickTake: Why US Deficit Is a Worry Again, and Will Remain SoIn August, Fitch Ratings Inc. stripped the US of its top-tier AAA credit rating while the Treasury announced a bigger-than-expected quarterly borrowing requirement. An estimate last week from the Congressional Budget Office that the deficit jumped by more than 20% in the just-ended fiscal year, to $1.7 trillion, added to the unease.“It’s just hard to believe that this is a sustainable policy going forward,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Oct. 11 at the E2 Summit in Park City, Utah.Administration officials insist that President Joe Biden is committed to reducing the budget shortfall and they argue that his initiatives to boost public infrastructure spending and promote private investment to fight climate change will help the economy in the long-run.Other WorriesBut it’s not just the mounting supply of Treasury securities that’s spooked investors. It’s also weakening demand. Many investors worry that the two biggest foreign holders of US debt, China and Japan, will scale back their purchases.The Fed itself is already cutting back, methodically reducing its bond holdings in an operation known as quantitative tightening. And officials have signaled they’ll continue to do so even after they begin expected cuts in interest rates sometime next year.“The bar is very high” to the Fed veering from that path, Coronado said.The rise in yields is threatening to make the untenable fiscal outlook even worse, said former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who advised George W. Bush while he was in office.“We have a super-interest-sensitive budget,” said Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum. “If the bond market is starting to decipher more accurately the effective fiscal position of the US, then we’re in trouble.”Warsh agreed. “It’s exceedingly difficult to have sound monetary policy without sound fiscal policy,” the Hoover Institution visiting fellow said. “And US fiscal policy is decidedly unsound.”--With assistance from Liz Capo McCormick and Matthew Boesler.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJeep’s Jump to $100,000 SUVs Risks Leaving Loyal Buyers BehindThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal Again©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Swati Pandey,RBA’s Bullock Highlights Difficulties in Cooling Inflation,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank Governor Michele Bullock pointed to a series of obstacles to bringing inflation back to target that range from sticky services prices to repeated global shocks including the Israel-Hamas war.Most Read from BloombergHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls Support“There are a few things that are suggestive that it’s going to be difficult to get inflation down,” the Reserve Bank chief said during a fireside chat in Sydney on Wednesday, pointing to price pressures in everything from takeaway shops to hairdressers, as well as ultra-low unemployment.Then there are supply shocks from global events that policymakers tend to look through, but are struggling to do so this time. “The problem is that we’ve got shock after shock after shock and the more that keeps inflation elevated, even if it’s a supply shock, the more people adjust their thinking, the more entrenched inflation is likely to become, so that’s the challenge.”Bullock, in her first public appearance since taking the helm at the central bank, didn’t specifically address the outlook for monetary policy.The central bank has increased interest rates by 4 percentage points since May 2022 in a bid to gain control over inflation that remains well above the 2-3% target. Economists expect one final hike, as early as next month, to take the cash rate to 4.35%.All eyes are on monthly employment data released on Thursday and the third-quarter inflation report next week for indications of what the RBA will do. The central bank also receive its staff’s quarterly update of economic forecasts at the Nov. 7 policy meeting.“It’s a challenging economic environment,” Bullock said. “What we are observing is that monetary policy is starting to bite. We are seeing a slowdown in consumption.”Story continuesAustralia’s benchmark policy rate is lower than many other developed nations despite inflation being at least as high. The RBA’s 4 points of hikes in the current tightening campaign trail both the US and New Zealand’s 5.25 points.“We are trying to bring inflation back down in a reasonable amount of time while preserving employment gains and not really bringing the economy to its knees,” Bullock said.Data on Australia’s A$2.3 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy has been mixed. Businesses are coping better with higher borrowing costs than households, with consumer sentiment in “deeply pessimistic” territory.The labor market has proved resilient with the unemployment rate hovering between 3.4%-3.7% over the past year, near its lowest level since the 1970s. The residential property market has also unexpectedly rebounded strongly this year.The housing market “has surprised me a bit,” Bullock said, noting it was now back at pandemic-era peaks.(Updates with unemployment range over past year, extra comments.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Max Reyes,U.S. Bancorp Vows to Shrink Itself to Avoid Added Fed Scrutiny,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Bancorp promised federal regulators it would shrink its balance sheet and reduce its risk profile, a move that frees it from more stringent regulations.Most Read from BloombergHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportThe nation’s largest regional lender won approval from the Federal Reserve to retain its designation as a Category III bank, it said in a regulatory filing. That means it faces less costly and time-consuming regulations.The promises to shrink itself came after the lender, which had $665 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, spent months preparing to comply with the rules associated with becoming a so-called Category II bank, a designation given to lenders with more than $700 billion in assets.“U.S. Bancorp represents that it anticipates taking further actions to reduce its projected risk profile, including further net reductions in assets and increases in regulatory capital,” Ann Misback, secretary for the Federal Reserve Board, said in a letter to U.S. Bancorp’s lawyer. Based on the fact’s the company presented, she said, the board “has approved U.S. Bancorp’s request for complete relief from the commitments.”A spokesman for U.S. Bancorp declined to comment on the letter.

That includes reducing its investment portfolio by about $30 billion and completing loan sales and securitizations worth roughly $7 billion, while reducing short-term borrowing on its balance sheet, the Fed said.Story continuesIn its decision, the central bank also cited a series of proposals it has made that will tighten rules for Category III lenders, such as one that will require such lenders to include unrealized losses on their balance sheet investments in their capital ratios.U.S. Bancorp agreed to submit to a stricter regulatory regime as part of its deal for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s Union Bank. It has previously said it would be able to comply with the more stringent rules by the end of 2024.“The regulatory change is very positive for U.S. Bancorp,” Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. “It will give the company greater flexibility in managing its balance sheet over the next two years.”--With assistance from Jenny Surane.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
HARM VENHUIZEN,Federal jury convicts 2 employees in fatal Wisconsin corn mill explosion,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A federal jury has convicted two senior employees at a Wisconsin corn plant of falsifying records and obstructing an investigation into a fatal corn dust explosion in 2017, Justice Department officials announced on Tuesday.Corn dust is explosive, and high concentrations are dangerous. Federal regulations require grain mill operators to perform regular cleanings to reduce dust accumulations that could fuel a blast.Jurors found Derrick Clark, vice president of operations at Didion Milling, and Shawn Mesner, a former food safety superintendent at the company, guilty of multiple safety, environmental and fraud charges on Friday. The two men are the latest in a growing list of Didion employees found guilty in association with the 2017 explosion that killed five people at the company's Cambria corn mill.Attorneys listed for both men did not immediately respond to voicemails seeking comment on Tuesday.Didion Milling pleaded guilty in September to charges that its employees falsified environmental and safety compliance records for years leading up to the explosion. The company agreed to pay a $1 million fine and $10.25 million to the estates of the five workers who were killed.Clark was convicted on Friday of making false Clean Air Act compliance certifications and lying to investigators during a deposition. Mesner was found guilty of conspiring to mislead Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators by lying on sanitation records that tracked cleanings meant to remove corn dust from the mill.“Derrick Clark and Shawn Messner chose to intentionally mislead OSHA investigators and made false statements about their knowledge of working conditions at the plant to protect themselves and cover their mistakes,” OSHA Regional Administrator Bill Donovan said in a statement.Sentencing hearings have not yet been scheduled for either of the men. At least five other Didion employees have pleaded guilty or been convicted of charges including concealing environmental violations, lying to investigators and falsifying cleaning logs.___Harm Venhuizen is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Sam Kim,"Bank of Korea to Keep Rate on Hold as Debt, Conflict Weigh on Economy","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea is poised to hold its benchmark interest rate steady as it seeks to quell a resurgence in household debt while also preserving economic momentum.Most Read from BloombergHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportAll 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect South Korea’s central bank to keep the rate at 3.5% when the board convenes on Thursday. It would be the sixth consecutive hold since authorities last hiked in January.The meeting comes as the crisis in the Middle East threatens to boost oil prices and exacerbate global inflationary pressure. Domestically, private loans are increasing again as housing prices rebound, alarming policymakers who consider high household debt levels a major long-term risk for economic growth.Household debt hit a record 1,079.8 trillion won ($798 billion) as of the end of September as mortgages rose by the most since February 2020, according to central bank data. BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong has urged potential home buyers to be aware that rates could stay high for longer than expected.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“We expect a shift away from its tight stance in the second quarter of 2024. But if the debt continues to grow unchecked, the BOK could delay its pivot.”— Hyosung Kwon, economistTo read the full report, click hereThe board is in lockstep with Rhee over the need to deter asset bubbles and avoid financial imbalances at a time when consumer inflationary pressure persists. Its members have been unanimous in warning for months that they’re ready to take the rate higher by another quarter-percentage-point if deemed necessary.Markets are increasingly skeptical that it will come to pass. Another hike would put more pressure on credit markets still recovering from a series of crises that included the default of a Legoland Korea developer last year and a bank run at a local credit union in the summer. At the same time, the outlook for economic growth remains precarious as exports have yet to return to growth, and industrial output is still shaky.Story continues“The lack of a dissenting vote for a hike so far leaves us skeptical of a strong consensus and willingness to take action,” Kathleen Oh, a Bank of America economist, said in a note. “Amid fading growth momentum, we think the macro environment is even less conducive for a further hike now.”There’s also growing public unease about mounting interest rate loads for households and companies. In a cabinet meeting last week, President Yoon Suk Yeol cited “interest burdens” as he spoke of jitters in global financial markets and their potential impact on Korean rates in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel.“High inflation and the increases of interest burdens will bring about a reduction in people’s real income and exert a negative influence on the economic recovery momentum,” he said, according to a transcript released by his office.The impact on oil prices from the conflict remains limited so far. But Rhee said in an interview with Bloomberg TV last week that if the conflict were to widen, and the oil price were to jump above the mid-$80 range, it would prompt the bank to readjust its growth outlook for next year.The BOK expects Korean economic growth to accelerate to 2.2% in 2024, versus the 1.4% forecast for this year. Growth prospects are increasingly becoming a focus for the BOK, Rhee has suggested, even as he’s made it clear the primary policy objective remains fighting inflation. Price growth briefly cooled at the start of the summer to the targeted 2% level, before a resurgence in August and September.The BOK began its tightening cycle in August 2021, launching its fight against inflation earlier than peers including the Federal Reserve. Some economists say the BOK may ultimately jump ahead of the Fed once again — in the opposite direction, reducing rates in the event financial and economic concerns continue to mount.“A prolonged period of elevated interest rates may increase financial stress to the point at which firms and households are unable to sustain their economic activity,” Jeong Woo Park, a Korea economist at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note. “Both households and nonfinancial corporate sectors are nearing that point.”--With assistance from Tomoko Sato.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in Tech©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

Biden will travel to Israel on Wednesday to show his support after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas that sparked the conflict. At the same time, markets remain on edge as Israel is still making plans for a ground offensive into Gaza.Earlier, prices dropped more than 1% before paring its losses after Russia’s Central Bank reiterated expectations that OPEC+ may consider an increase in output at the beginning of 2024. Shortly afterward, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that it’s still too early to talk about what market decisions OPEC+ may take at its meeting in November.“Traders remain on high alert” while oil remains in a holding pattern, said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. “Many investors are not willing to make outright bets on crude in the current environment but are actively buying upside call options in the event crude supply is impacted. It is a low conviction, highly volatile trading environment.”Crude traders are also tracking events in Barbados, where Venezuela’s government is expected to sign a deal with the US-backed opposition later on Tuesday. In exchange for a freer presidential election next year, the agreement could pave the way for the US to ease sanctions against the country, potentially boosting oil exports.The crude market has been left on edge by the crisis in the Middle East and the risk that it spreads beyond Israel and Gaza, potentially endangering crude flows from key producers. Iran, which supports Hamas, has warned that an expansion of the war was “approaching the inevitable stage.” In addition to roiling futures markets in recent days, the conflict has also upended options pricing and sent freight costs soaring.Story continuesLooking ahead, the path of least resistance seems to be to the upside, Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at StoneX, said in a note. WTI’s technical support levels are between $84.10 to $85.45, with crude futures likely to find resistance from $87.15 to $87.95, he said.Terminal users can click here for more on the Israel-Hamas War.--With assistance from Francine Lacqua.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max Abelson©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Augusta Saraiva and Vince Golle,US Economic Data Keep Coming In Stronger and Defying Forecasts,"(Bloomberg) -- US retail sales exceeded all forecasts and industrial production strengthened last month, fresh evidence of a resilient American consumer whose spending is helping stabilize manufacturing.Most Read from BloombergHundreds Dead at Gaza Hospital as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden to Visit as Oil Climbs After Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportSales, unadjusted for inflation, increased 0.7% after upwardly revised advances in the prior two months, according to the Commerce Department. So-called control group sales — which are used to calculate spending on merchandise in the gross domestic product report — rose a better-than-expected 0.6%.Robust consumer demand, in the aftermath of September data showing stubborn inflation and surging job growth, risks prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. The reports prompted a slew of economists, from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, to boost their tracking estimates for third-quarter GDP.The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to the highest level since 2007, while the S&P 500 Index fell. Traders increased bets of a rate hike in the coming months and pushed bets on the first cut to later in 2024.The advance in sales illustrates a consumer who is still delivering for the economy, seemingly undaunted by high prices. Spending is being fueled by a robust labor market and defying economists’ expectations of a slowdown on the back of a retreat in pandemic-related household savings.“The death of the US consumer has been greatly exaggerated,” Omair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights LLC, said in a note. Including control group sales revisions, “this is a good all-around report that shows continued strength in consumer spending.”Control group sales, which exclude food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations, rose an annualized 6.4% in the three months through September. That’s the largest end-of-quarter advance since June 2022.Story continuesThe Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast was boosted to show the economy grew an annualized 5.4% in the third quarter, which would be the strongest since the end of 2021. Personal consumption probably increased at a 4.1% pace, the fastest since the second quarter of that same year.Resilient demand is helping to shore up the nation’s manufacturers. The Fed’s index of US industrial production rose in September to the highest level in nearly five years, led by strength in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Factory output last month was bolstered a pickup in the production of both consumer goods and construction supplies.Read More: US Industrial Production Rises to Highest in Nearly Five YearsIn the July-to-September period, industrial production was largely fueled by a surge in utility output and a pickup in mining that included higher oil and gas extraction. Manufacturing is also finding some footing as retailers make progress getting inventories more in line with demand.“The mighty US consumer continues to fuel demand and factories pushed ahead despite several headwinds (including the UAW strike),” Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.“While this may not be quite enough to move the Fed from the sidelines in November, a resilient US economy means the central bank’s job to cool the economy and restore price stability may not be done yet,” Thiagamoorthy said.Morgan Stanley economists boosted their third-quarter GDP growth forecast to 4.9% on the back of Tuesday’s data. JPMorgan now sees 4.3% and Goldman Sachs lifted its estimate to 4%.Purchases rose in eight out of 13 categories last month, including stronger receipts at restaurants, motor vehicle dealers and personal care stores, the retail sales report showed. Sales of motor vehicles jumped 1% in September, the largest gain in four months and despite higher financing rates.Purchases made at restaurants and bars — the only service-sector category in the report — increased 0.9% last month.“As long as businesses keep producing and hiring and consumers keep spending, it can be a bit of a virtuous cycle,” said Kayla Bruun, senior economist at Morning Consult LLC. “With all the headwinds from inflation and interest rates, you would think that that would break down, but it seems to be working.”While inflation is still running well above the Fed’s 2% target, the prices of key consumer goods including apparel and furniture fell sharply last month. The price declines help explain a more restrained value of receipts at clothing retailers and appliances merchants in September. Apparel store sales fell 0.8% in September, the first decline in six months.What Bloomberg Economics Says....“Solid September retail sales overstate the degree of consumer resilience. Though consumer spending is indeed looking very strong for 3Q, it’s due to a temporary burst in activity that’s unsustainable.”— Eliza Winger.

Josh Schafer,Resilient consumer keeps pressure on Fed,"A hot jobs market is continuing to help boost consumer spending.Retail sales rose 0.7% in September from the previous month, more than double Wall Street's estimates for 0.3% growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department released on Tuesday. Retail sales have now grown from the month prior for six straight months, marking a consistent trend of consumer spending.This, economists say, has been supported by an average of nearly 270,000 nonfarm payroll additions over the same period. With no clear signs of the labor market fully cooling, the strong position of the US consumer entering the fourth quarter of 2023 could provide upside risks to inflation that's already showing signs of stickiness — and prompt more Fed rate hikes.""The economy is entering Q4 with more momentum than we previously thought,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ""The risks to our forecast for a slight contraction in consumption in Q4 are firmly to the upside. The strength of the economy also means that Fed officials will leave the door open for additional rate hikes.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/14477522/embed?auto=1></iframe>Fed Chair Jerome Powell has noted in the past that a stronger US economy could mean more Fed rate hikes to ensure prices fall.""We’re not looking for a decrease in consumer spending,"" Powell said in September. ""It’s a good thing that the economy’s strong ... If the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2% [inflation]—because we will get back to 2%.""Over the past week, Fed officials eased market concerns of another interest rate hike as central bankers explained credit tightening caused by rising bond yields could effectively take the place of another Fed rate hike. The discussion provided reprieve for bond yields, and stocks rallied.But that shifted on Tuesday with the September retail sales report. Markets as of Tuesday afternoon are pricing in a roughly 40% chance that the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates at its December meeting, up from a 25% chance just a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Stocks opened lower after the report, too, while bond yields rose. The 10-year Treasury yield breached 4.85%, its highest level in more than a week and just off its 16-year highs.Story continues“Today’s strong report along with a recent string of positive economic surprises suggest the economy carried more momentum than previously thought over the summer,"" EY-Parthenon senior economist Lydia Boussour wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ""This will keep the Federal Reserve on high inflation alert, and though it won’t tilt the Federal Open Market Committee toward another fed funds rate hike at the November meeting, the December meeting will very much remain a ‘live’ one.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13015579/embed?auto=1></iframe>All eyes on the labor market The overall picture for the consumer is still murky. Credit card delinquencies have been on the rise, the personal savings rate just hit its lowest level of 2023, and it's still unclear how the return of student loan payments could hurt consumer spending.""Pandemic-related sources of spending like excess savings and easy access to cheap credit are fading, but what this report tells us is that households have grown more comfortable spending at elevated rates,"" Wells Fargo's senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a research note on Tuesday.And Quinlan highlights that willingness to spend might not be going anywhere.""We have long stressed that real income is the last major driver of spending, and continued labor market tightness suggests income can continue to fuel consumption in the near term,"" Quinlan wrote. ""In fact, the only thing that looks to break the back of this consumer would be weakness in the labor market.But consistent weakness in the labor market isn't apparent at the moment. Outside of wages retreating toward pre-pandemic normalcy, the labor market remains robust. The US economy added more jobs in September than it had since January. Job openings still remain historically high as the most people look for jobs since before the pandemic. And layoffs have been muted as jobless claims have remained tame.""We expect the consumer to remain supported in the next couple of quarters as long as the labor market remains strong,"" Citi's economics team wrote in a research note on Tuesday.On Thursday, Powell is expected to provide an update on the economy during a speech at the Economic Club of New York.<img alt=""Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell holds a news conference after the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2023.

Randy Thanthong-Knight,Inflation in Canada Reverses Just in Time for Central Bank,"(Bloomberg) -- Canadian inflation is decelerating again, leaving room for the central bank to hold interest rates steady next week.Most Read from BloombergHundreds Dead at Gaza Hospital as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden ‘Deeply Saddened’ Over Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportThe consumer price index rose 3.8% in September from a year ago, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday in Ottawa, slower than the median estimate of 4% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. It’s a reversal that comes at the right time for Bank of Canada policymakers, who will soon begin their deliberations for a rate decision on Oct. 25.Governor Tiff Macklem and his officials paused rate increases in early September, saying they wanted to see how the economy evolved. A surprise second-quarter economic contraction and employment losses in July had allowed them to look past an early-summer uptick in inflation.But then the headline rate of inflation rose again in August and the economy added 104,000 jobs over August and September, while wage growth for permanent employees accelerated. That prompted some economists and traders to speculate that another hike was imminent.That pressure appears to be off, for now.Traders in overnight swaps pared their bets on another rate increase next week, falling from around 50% odds to less than 20%. Bonds rallied; the loonie fell sharply after the data release before rebounding.“The level of inflation remains much too high for comfort, but the trend is the BOC’s friend here,” Benjamin Reitzes, a rates and macro strategist at the Bank of Montreal, said in a report to investors. “Given that inflation is the most lagging of indicators, and the economy is clearly weakening, we’re likely to see ongoing disinflationary pressure.”“There’s no need for further rate hikes in Canada,” he added.Story continuesOn a monthly basis, the consumer price index fell 0.1% in September, versus expectations for an increase of 0.1%.Two key yearly inflation measures that are tracked closely by the Bank of Canada and filter out components with more volatile price fluctuations — the so-called trim and median core rates — also eased, averaging 3.8%, from 4% a month earlier.A three-month moving average of underlying price pressures that Macklem has said policymakers are tracking fell to an annualized pace of 3.67%, from 4.29% a month earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations.The unexpected deceleration in inflation doesn’t fully offset the upside surprises of the past few months, said Andrew Grantham, an economist with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.“However, with activity in the economy stalling in Q2 and Q3, excess demand appears to be diminishing, suggesting that inflation should continue to decelerate in the quarters ahead without the need for further interest rate hikes.”On Monday, the central bank’s surveys showed that both businesses and consumers believe the full impact of rate hikes has yet to be felt, though inflation expectations remain elevated.Federal Reserve policymakers are also grappling with a public view that inflation will stay well above the central bank’s target. Americans expect prices to climb at a 3.8% rate over the next year, the highest in five months, according to a survey reading from the University of Michigan. The US inflation rate was 3.7% in September, above its level in June and July.Services InflationIn September, the year-over-year deceleration in inflation was broad, stemming from lower prices for some travel-related services and durable goods. Food price increases slowed. On a monthly basis, the slowdown was driven by lower gasoline prices, Statistics Canada said. Air travel costs were also down.Goods prices fell 0.3% from a month earlier, the first such decline since December, and rose 3.6% from a year ago. The services CPI was unchanged from August, the first time it hasn’t grown on a monthly basis since November 2021, while the yearly rate slowed to 3.9%, from 4.3% in August.Overall, prices rose at a slower pace on a yearly basis compared with August in six of 10 provinces. The rate of inflation was higher in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec — provinces that saw outsized increases in gasoline prices.“The slower increase in Canadian consumer prices in September was a step in the right direction,” Claire Fan, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a report to investors. “With more easing in inflation readings expected in the months ahead, we expect the Bank of Canada to stay on pause through the rest of the year.”--With assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Danielle Bochove.(Updates with more context and commentary beginning in the third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Ana Monteiro,"Fed Has Time to See If More Needed to Tame Inflation, Barkin Says","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said policymakers “have time” to work out whether they can hold interest rates steady or if they need to raise them further to get inflation to policymakers’ 2% goal.Most Read from BloombergHundreds Dead at Gaza Hospital as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameIsrael Latest: Biden ‘Deeply Saddened’ Over Hospital BlastTreasury Yields Climb as Hot Data Fuel Fed Wagers: Markets WrapWill Xi Jinping’s Gamble on Vladimir Putin Pay Off?UPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls Support“I am still looking to be convinced, both that demand is settling and that any weakness is feeding through to inflation,” Barkin said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Real Estate Roundtable in Washington Tuesday.While the path for inflation “isn’t yet clear,” he said, “we have time to see if we have done enough, or whether there’s more work to do.”Noting that headline annual inflation had slowed to 3.7% in September from a peak of 9.1% in June last year, the Richmond Fed chief said “we aren’t there yet, but we’re headed in the right direction.” Barkin, who does not vote on rate decisions this year, said he supported the Federal Open Market Committee’s decision to forgo a rate hike at its September meeting so officials can gather more information to assess the effects of cumulative tightening so far.Fed officials — who have raised interest rates by more than 5 percentage points since March 2022 — have signaled they’re inclined to hold policy steady for a second time in a row next month, after a recent run-up in bond yields tightened financial conditions.Read More: Fed Officials Set to Extend Pause Without Saying Hikes Are DoneBut hikes aren’t off the table thanks to data that keep demonstrating the US economy’s resilience, including retail sales and factory output figures out earlier Tuesday.Fed officials see a number of risks — including food-price shocks and a stronger housing market — that could reignite inflation, minutes of their most recent meeting showed. Also, an expected ground war between Israel and Hamas threatens to keep energy prices elevated, feeding price growth.Story continues“We are walking a fine line — if we undercorrect, inflation re-emerges. If we overcorrect, we do unnecessary damage to the economy,” Barkin said. “And even the best policy has the potential to be waylaid by external events, as we’ve been reminded with the recent news from the Middle East.”Speaking to reporters after his speech, Barkin said that if inflation started to move up and if demand stays as strong as it’s been, “then you’d say that’s the kind of environment where you’d want to do more” through a rate hike.In projections submitted in September, 12 of 19 officials said they expect another rate increase before the end of the year. Futures markets are pricing in a less than 15% chance of a quarter-point rate increase at the November meeting, though odds of a hike by the January meeting are above 50%.Barkin’s comments echoed remarks he made on Oct. 5, when he said policymakers have time to determine if they need to do more work to cool inflation.(Updates with comment from Barkin in ninth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

Meanwhile, August's sales were revised up to 0.8% from a previously reported 0.6% increase.The September report, released by the Commerce Department, offers a snapshot of consumer spending at a time when economic data has been coming in largely stronger than expected despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking campaign as the central bank seeks to cool inflation.September's retail sales growth comes despite mounting headwinds facing the consumer like a tightening credit environment, gas prices hitting 2023 highs to end the summer, and the resumption of student loan payments.

Jonnelle Marte,"Higher Rates Contribute to Rising Home Prices, Fed’s Harker Says","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said higher interest rates are making it more challenging for first-time home buyers by raising borrowing costs and limiting inventory, which is also leading to higher home prices.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Army Says Hamas Officials Dead; Over 600,000 in Gaza Flee SouthIsrael Latest: Minister Warns of Long War as Biden Weighs VisitUS Pushes to Contain Israel-Hamas War, Warns Iran About EscalationStocks Rise Amid Efforts to Stifle Israel Conflict: Markets WrapXi’s $1 Trillion ‘Project of the Century’ Gets a Reality CheckHigher rates discourage current owners from listing their homes for sale, which puts a crunch on inventory, Harker said Monday in remarks prepared for a convention in Philadelphia organized by the Mortgage Bankers Association.“The rise in interest rates not only raised borrowing costs on those looking to purchase a home, but it also contributed to the contraction of inventory,” Harker said. “And it is just simple market dynamics that a lack of inventory would elevate prices overall, further lessening the depth of the pool of potential buyers.”While new home sales are “trending upward,” those sales cannot fully compensate for the broader housing slowdown, he said.Harker, who votes on rate decisions this year, also repeated comments he made last week asserting the Fed can hold its benchmark rate steady as long as there is not a sharp turn in the economic data. He reiterated that the US central bank is still doing a lot to fight inflation after raising the benchmark by more than 5 percentage points since last year, and shrinking its balance sheet.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSRural America Is Losing Nursing Homes, and Small Towns Are Reeling©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

Craig Torres and Rich Miller,Fed Officials Prepare to Extend Rate Pause Without Saying Hikes Are Done,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials look set to hold interest rates steady for the second time in a row next month — but they’re far from calling an end to their tightening campaign.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Army Says Hamas Officials Dead; Over 600,000 in Gaza Flee SouthUS Pushes to Contain Israel-Hamas War, Warns Iran About EscalationIsrael Latest: Biden and Abbas Talk as Gaza Invasion NearsGlobal Markets Stable as US Pushes to Contain Middle East WarYour Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas WarPolicymakers across the hawk-dove spectrum have signaled in recent days that they’re inclined to forgo a rate hike at their Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting following a run-up in bond yields that has tightened financial conditions.But with data on the labor market and inflation showing an economy that’s still humming, the Federal Open Market Committee is unlikely to take further rate increases off the table.“It’s too soon to declare victory,” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who has a rotating vote on rates this year, said Tuesday during a town hall event in North Dakota.Minutes from the Fed’s September gathering released Wednesday showed policymakers see a slew of risks that could push inflation higher than they expect, including shocks to food prices, a stronger housing market and a slowdown in the decline of goods prices. An anticipated ground war between Israel and Hamas also threatens to keep energy prices elevated, which could feed into more inflation pressures.Recent economic data also highlighted a resilient economy despite the Fed raising rates more than five percentage points since March 2022.Hiring surged last month as employers added 336,000 jobs — double the number estimated by economists, and the most since the start of the year. Producer prices rose more than forecast, and core inflation excluding shelter and energy services — a measure closely watched by Chair Jerome Powell — also picked up.Story continuesThe repeated “head fakes” in the economic data will make policymakers wary of signaling an end to further tightening, said Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at JP Morgan Investment Management in New York.“Whenever they are done, I don’t think they will say they are done,” Misra said. “They will want to keep the expectation or optionality to hike.”Fed officials are increasingly focused on trying to balance the risk of overshooting — and triggering a possible recession — against the need to get inflation back to target. They’re also wary of making the same mistake as the Bank of Canada, which in June had to restart its rate-increase campaign after a conditional pause, citing “excess demand” that was more persistent than anticipated.San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly called it the hardest phase of policymaking, as officials try to communicate how they are straddling two-sided risks.“When you don’t know exactly what will be needed, it’s not actually a terrific idea to telegraph one thing or the other,” she said on Oct. 5. “We could find ourselves with data that are really accelerating, and I don’t want to be in a position where we’ve said definitively we’re not going to do X, and then X is needed.”Yield SurgeNevertheless, a fast rise in bond yields after the Sept. 19-20 policy meeting has led some officials to conclude that they can skip a hike for the second consecutive meeting as higher market rates are doing some of the work of restraint.Philip Jefferson, who as vice chair plays a key role in communicating Fed policy on behalf of Powell, said Monday he’s watching the increase in Treasury yields as a potential further brake on the economy.“Looking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields and will keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy,” he said.Yields on the US government 10-year note touched the highest levels since 2007 on Oct. 6 before closing at 4.8%. As Fed officials signaled a November hike might be off the table, yields fell back, closing the week at 4.61%.Read More: Fed Leaders See Rise in Yields as Possible Substitute for Hike“We’re in this position where we kind of watch and see what happens,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Wednesday at a conference in Park City, Utah.Others, including Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic, have gone further, saying policy is restrictive enough to guide inflation back to the central bank’s 2% goal.But such a clear signal is unlikely to come from the Fed’s policy committee.In projections submitted just last month, 12 of 19 officials said they expect another rate increase before the end of the year.While policymakers could at some point tweak their post-meeting statement — which referenced “the extent of additional policy firming” — the data haven’t yet indicated that the inflation battle is over.The last reading on the Fed’s preferred core inflation measure showed prices rose 3.9% in the 12 months through August.Communication RisksA strong signal that the rate-hiking cycle is over risks a powerful rally in stock and bond markets, inducing more consumption and growth just when Fed officials are trying to moderate demand.Households seem to believe that the inflation fight is far from convincingly won. Both short- and longer-run inflation expectations moved higher this month, a University of Michigan survey showed Friday.“They can’t signal they are done,” said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC, because it immediately sets up expectations of when the Fed will start cutting.Fed officials also see it as essential to keep a lid on inflation expectations, and have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to restoring price stability, even if it means raising rates higher than they currently expect.“Two percent is and will remain our inflation target,” Powell said in his Aug. 25 remarks at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, central bank symposium.The Fed chief is set to speak Thursday at the Economic Club of New York.Lifting the threat of further hikes could also undermine that credibility with the public, raising the risk that inflation will become entrenched.“There is a very substantial risk that they will need to do more,” said Andrew Levin, a former senior Fed adviser who’s now a professor at Dartmouth College.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Introducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google Loophole©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Seana Smith,"'Fog on the horizon': CEOs brace for recession
A soft landing looks elusive as geopolitical risk raises bets of a recession.","Wall Street’s great debate of 2023 — whether the US economy is headed for a recession — is resurfacing amid escalating unrest in the Middle East.Heightened geopolitical risk, along with unabating inflationary pressures, surging bond yields, and the Federal Reserve’s ""higher for longer"" vision, has business leaders bracing for a contraction.“There’s a lot of fog on the horizon,” KPMG US CEO Paul Knopp told Yahoo Finance Live, citing geopolitical tensions as one of the top risks to the economy.Seventy-two percent of CEOs are preparing for a US recession over the next 12-18 months, according to The Conference Board’s survey of business leaders. While that’s an improvement from the start of the year, expectations about the short-term economic outlook have darkened.Big bank CEOs are among those weighing in on a more uncertain economic outlook. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon pointed to a number of potential risks, including a sober warning on geopolitical crises abroad. Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser noted “an increasingly cautious consumer” in the bank’s earnings release Friday.<img alt=""Jamie Dimon on recession risk "" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PMxqIBydwX1fZS3.H_YdSA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/6309c630-6a10-11ee-acc7-554e00d39dcc class=caas-img>Jamie Dimon on recession risk Fraser’s note of cracks beginning to form in consumer spending is something that’s been highlighted recently. Constellation Brands (STZ) CEO Bill Newlands told Yahoo Finance Live this week that shoppers are already ""spending a little less"" while being more ""careful"" about what they buy.The reason this is problematic is because the resilient consumer has helped the US economy defy recession predictions so far this year, as consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US GDP.And if you look at the recent sentiment data, it’s not too encouraging. Consumer sentiment plunged in October to its lowest level in five months, driven in large part by households expecting higher inflation next year.And sticky inflation is not just an issue for consumers, but for the Fed too. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed prices held steady at 3.7% in September, well above the Fed's goal of 2%.Story continues<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/6180194/embed?auto=1></iframe>“With the Fed committed to returning inflation back to its long-run target of 2%, this would raise the odds of rate increases this year, extend the duration of restrictive monetary policy, and increase the chances of a recession occurring down the road,” Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients this week.To sum it up: The probability of a recession is still anyone’s guess, but it’s safe to say the economic outlook remains murky. Sofi’s (SOFI) head of investment strategy Liz Young put it perfectly: “We are not out of the woods just yet,” she told Yahoo Finance. “It could still get worse before it gets better.”<img alt=""Surfer Stuart Grauer stretches his body before going out to surf, at Cardiff State Beach in Encinitas, California, U.S., July 26, 2023.

STAN CHOE,"Even with economic worries, Vivid Seats CEO says customers still pay to see sports and hair bands","NEW YORK (AP) — Strong spending by consumers has been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession, and Vivid Seats CEO Stan Chia doesn’t see demand in his industry falling off.He says customers are still using Vivid Seats to find tickets to concerts, sporting events and the theater even if interest rates are high and sentiment surveys show shoppers say they’re feeling nervous. Vivid Seats' marketplace allows people to buy and sell their tickets to live events.Chia told The Associated Press that he believes the explosion of pent-up demand for entertainment outside the house following the pandemic has burned out, and trends have returned more to normal. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Q: It seems like the economy is riding on whether U.S. consumers can keep spending. How do you see the state of the consumer today?A: I think what we can certainly see in our category is live events continues to be one that consumers are prioritizing in their discretionary income.This category, while it is discretionary by definition, doesn’t behave like others, like buying a new TV. You don’t really think about buying a new TV in the same way as whether you’re going to a Guns N' Roses concert.We are now past any point of potential pent-up demand release. What we’re really into is secular trends of the industry that really drive it forward. I think about where the generational priority is on spending. If you think about Gen Z, as they come into purchasing power they have prioritized experiences over goods and services.You’ve got folks like myself — the Guns N' Roses references shows I'm a geriatric millennial — I’ve certainly got a little more money than I did 20 years ago, and the bands that I love are touring, and I love the opportunity to go see that.Q: Can you go back to the idea of pent-up demand? This is no longer just people hungry to go to live events again for the first time after the pandemic shutdowns?Story continuesA: Where we fit as marketplace for live events, we are a great barometer for how much demand exceeds supply.If you go back to maybe 2021, the second half of that year through the first half of 2022, you could look at where our average order size was relative to 2019, for example, and you saw really, really big jumps. That’s where you saw pent-up demand being released. Numerically, just fantastic growth of that magnitude, that’s clearly driven by pent-up demandIn the second half of 2022 and now in 2023, if you were to plot that line, we’re right back on the industry line. The consumer demand is past pent-up demand.Q: So what do you make of all these surveys where consumers say they're worried? When will they stop spending?A: I certainly read and see all the things out there about the strength of the consumer and where sentiment is, but in this category, we’ve continued to see strength.We’re headquartered in Chicago Illinois, and the example I like to give, which unfortunately is not going to be true this year, is if the Bears go to the Super Bowl, you’re going to see a lot of fans who want to go to that event. This category in particular has that FOMO-esque truth to it. That’s what continues to drive consumer purchasing.Q: Are you seeing any differences in consumer behavior? Are football fans spending more than baseball fans? Concert goers in high-income ZIP codes versus lower-income ones?A: I think fandom just traverses all categories and all demographics. You’ve got a very consistent level of intensity whether you’re talking about sports fans, concert fans, theater fans, comedy fans, down to the team level.Q: Are you worried that this year’s strength for concerts may be because of a couple of high-profile performers like Beyonce and Taylor Swift? Will next year be a regression to the mean?A: Taylor Swift and Beyonce are phenomenal artists and performers. We’re just so privileged to see them put on amazing shows this year. I think the beauty of the category is there are always amazing artists out there on tour. We’re in the fourth quarter of the year now, we’re excited to hear about the major acts that are going to be playing next year. We just heard Foo Fighters are going on tour next summer.Q: Does it bother you that one of the first search-engine results for your company is: Is it safe to buy on Vivid Seats?A: No. Until we become a household name, and we are on our way there, you’re always going to look and see who is this company. You'll find we are an award-winning customer service company with a 100% buyer guarantee and a rewards program.Q: There's a big pushback by customers against fees getting added at the last screen of a transaction online. Any possibility Vivid Seats will show prices including all fees at the first instance?A: We are so supportive of all efforts and all legislation that drive transparency in all industries. We’re going to continue to be very supportive of a competitive playing field.We understand that consumers are looking for value in what they purchase, and I think when you look at what we do – where customers who buy 10 tickets get one (more through a reward credit) — we put our money where the mouth is."
Ines Ferré,"Oil prices spike as G7 enforces Russian export price caps, Israel-Hamas war continues","Oil prices jumped more than 5% during Friday's session amid the Israeli-Hamas war and a clampdown by the US on Russian crude export price caps.On Friday afternoon, West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent International (BZ=F) settled at $87.69 and $90.89 per barrel, respectively.The spike comes as Israel launches counterattacks against Hamas and warns residents of northern Gaza to evacuate their homes. The Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has sparked worries of the conflict broadening to other participants, including Iran.""The oil market may be anticipating that the United States will more strictly enforce sanctions on both Russia and Iran and that will lead to a reduction of oil supplies,"" Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told Yahoo Finance on Friday.Oil is also reacting to enforcements on Russian oil exports price caps imposed by the G7 last year, aimed at limiting funds to Russia for its war against Ukraine.On Thursday the coalition said it identified the owners of vessels carrying Russian oil priced above the $60 price cap.""As a Coalition, we reiterate our strong commitment to imposing sanctions and other economic measures against Russia in response to its illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war,"" read the statement by the G7, which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.Oil has been volatile this week amid worries of a broader conflict breaking out in the Middle East following the worst assault on Israel in decades. Prices rose early in the week but fell on Wednesday amid speculation that Iran, a longtime ally of Hamas, may not have been involved in a surprise attack on Oct. 7.Targets against Iran's oil fields or a disruption of the nearby Strait of Hormuz, a major passageway for crude, would likely send crude prices higher.""I think that if evidence is found that directly connects Iran to the massacre perpetrated by Hamas, it is much more likely that Iranian military targets are struck,"" said Lipow.Story continuesThe analyst points out Iran increased its oil production to over 3.2 million barrels per day from 2 million in 2020 and has raised exports to China.""The [US] administration has turned a blind eye to these increases as they are focused on reining in gasoline prices,"" said Lipow.

Reade Pickert,US Consumer Inflation Expectations Jump to a Five-Month High,"(Bloomberg) -- US consumers’ year-ahead inflation expectations rose sharply in early October, driving a steep deterioration in Americans’ views of their finances as well as sentiment.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Army Strikes Hezbollah Posts in LebanonTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerIsrael Latest: Blinken Says Must Stop Conflict From SpreadingWider War in Middle East Could Tip the World Economy Into RecessionNYC Boosts Security Ahead of ‘All Out for Palestine’ ProtestAmericans expect prices will climb at a 3.8% rate over the next year, the highest in five months and up from the 3.2% expected in September, according to the preliminary October reading from the University of Michigan. They see costs rising 3% over the next five to 10 years, compared to last month’s 2.8%.The sentiment index slid more than 5 points in October to 63, the sharpest monthly decline since June of last year. The figure fell short of all but one estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.“After stabilizing earlier this year, concerns about inflation have grown again,” Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement. “About 49% of consumers reported that high prices are eroding their living standards, up substantially from 39% last month and matching the all-time high last recorded in July 2022.”The high cost of living across the country continues to depress household sentiment. The last time consumers were this pessimistic about their current finances was when inflation hit a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022.Households were most concerned about high costs of groceries and fuel. Respondents with a high school diploma or less reported a particularly sharp decline in sentiment.“If these concerns continue to grow, consumer attitudes will keep deteriorating as well,” Hsu said.Data out Thursday showed consumer prices rose at a brisk pace in September for a second month, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s intent to keep borrowing costs high to stamp out inflation.Story continuesConsumers’ views of the economy’s outlook over the next year also soured, falling 14 points — the most since May 2022 — to 60.One bright spot, buying conditions for durable goods held steady.The current conditions gauge dropped to a five-month low of 66.7 from 71.4.

Catarina Saraiva,Fed’s Harker Reiterates Call for Holding Interest Rates Steady,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said disinflation is under way and reiterated that he favors holding interest rates where they are, barring a sharp change in data.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Army Strikes Hezbollah Posts in LebanonTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerWider War in Middle East Could Tip the World Economy Into RecessionNYC Boosts Security Ahead of ‘All Out for Palestine’ ProtestCanada’s Supreme Court Voids Most of Trudeau Environment Law“I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are,” Harker said in a virtual event with the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. “By doing nothing, we are still doing something. And, actually, we are doing quite a lot.”Harker said economic and financial conditions are evolving a bit better than he had expected, with prices cooling and labor-market tightness unwinding.“I am sure policy rates are restrictive, and as long they remain so, we will steadily press down on inflation and bring markets into a better balance,” Harker said.The Fed has been carefully calibrating policy this year after sharply increasing interest rates in 2022 and policymakers have said they’ll need to keep rates high for a long time to cool inflation.Officials held rates at their meeting last month while signaling that they’d likely deliver another increase this year. Now, with two more meetings to go, some policymakers have said that a run-up in bond yields since the September decision may obviate the need for further tightening.At the same time, an unexpected increase in the September consumer price index may renew pressure on Fed officials, who are determined to fully bring inflation down to their 2% goal. Harker noted the uptick in the CPI but said he’s focused on how data performs over a few months.“First, we will not tolerate a reacceleration in prices,” Harker said. “But second, I do not want to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices.”Story continuesHe said he’s prepared to adjust policy “either way” should the economic picture change, noting several risks including labor strikes, higher oil prices, the possibility of a government shutdown and the resumption of student-loan payments.In August, at the Fed’s annual policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Harker signaled support for keeping rates where they were and assessing later whether more tightening would be needed.The Philadelphia Fed chief said the significant increase in debt-service costs is putting “real pressure” on the US budget deficit, adding that analysis by researchers at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania shows that the point where this becomes a problem is “not that far off.”“We need to deal with it,” he said.(Updates with comment on deficit in penultimate paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Business Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded Programs©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Hamza Shaban,The Fed's next 'rate hike' has already arrived,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsAnother interest rate increase is creeping its way through the economy. But this time it didn’t come from the Federal Reserve. Spooky season is upon us, and so is the phantom rate hike.The recent surge in Treasury yields has unleashed an array of anxiety goblins, from fears of a stock market slump to worries about ballooning interest payments on government debt.But policymakers also see rising yields as a way to slow the economy without having to go through the trouble of raising rates again.In effect, elevated yields can do the work of central bankers for them — functioning as a rate hike without instituting an actual rate hike.This isn't the only time recently where we've seen a phantom rate hike. In March Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the bank failures and associated turmoil essentially acted as another rate hike.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsLong-term Treasury yields have a direct influence on households and businesses. They impact the cost of mortgages, car loans, and taking on other types of debt. So increasing yields have a tightening effect, slowing economic activity.Though it's receded this week, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) has risen to levels last seen in 2007, climbing roughly 30 basis points since the Fed’s meeting in September.Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson pointed to the rise in yields and their impact in a speech earlier this week, pledging to ""remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields ... as I assess the future path of policy.""Jefferson said that the Fed is in a particularly sensitive period of managing risk, having to balance between the twin risks of too loose and too tight.Story continuesOther Fed officials have chimed in on the bond market acting like a pinch-hitter.“We're just kind of keeping a very close eye on that, and then we'll see how these higher rates feed into what we're trying to do in policy,” said Fed Governor Chris Waller on Wednesday.But as with the Fed’s previous rate increases, a rise in inflation or other unfavorable observations could force the central bank to move. And if yields slide, their tightening effect would diminish, creating a greater need for the Fed to enact a genuine hike instead of relying on a substitute.There’s a circular logic to all of this, which means it can turn on a dime.As Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said earlier this week, it’s possible higher bond yields will mean less work for the Fed. But if those yields are higher because the market’s expectations for the Fed are changing, the Fed might have to follow through on those expectations to keep those yields high.In other words, there's a wobbly Jenga tower of expectations.“It’s hard for me to say definitively that because they moved, we don’t have to move,” Kashkari said. “I don’t know yet.”For now, as some Fed officials think the focus of the tightening campaign should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels, the latest data might support more of a let-the-bond-market-do-the-work approach.While the likelihood of a rate hike next month has fallen, that may be because one has already come through. It just didn’t come from the Fed.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

"Ignacio Olivera Doll, Carolina Gonzalez and Manuela Tobias",Argentina Central Bank Hikes Rate to 133% on Inflation Data,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s central bank sharply raised its key rate Thursday for the sixth time this year in an effort to contain inflation as price gains continue accelerating above 100% before a presidential election.Most Read from BloombergTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerIsrael Latest: UN Staff Given Evacuation Order for Northern GazaIsrael Latest: Mideast Rallies Grow as Gaza Crisis WorsensVideo Game Cyberpunk 2077 Uses AI To Replace Deceased Voice ActorJeff Bezos Buys His Florida Neighbor’s Mansion for $79 MillionThe monetary authority raised its key rate 15 percentage points to 133%, according to a statement. The move came after September inflation data published Thursday showing prices rose 138.3% from a year ago, the fastest pace since the early 1990s when Argentina was exiting hyperinflation. It also comes after officials hiked rates 21 percentage points in August.Read More: Argentina’s Black Market Peso Rate Tops 1,000 Per Dollar (1)The central bank made the decision to move the benchmark rate based on a sharp selloff in Argentina’s black market exchange rate in recent days, according to two officials with direct knowledge. The “dollar blue” rate touched a record low of 1,040 pesos per dollar on Tuesday. As recently as Monday the central bank planned to hold the key rate, according to people with direct knowledge of the deliberations who asked not to be identified.A central bank spokesperson said the bank does not comment on rate decisions ahead of time nor on policy discussions.Economists said the rate hike won’t do much to cool inflation because it’s coupled with money printing to finance government spending and still falls below inflation in real terms.“The government is trying to gain time and, unfortunately, this does not solve anything. The effect will be almost nil,” said Alejo Costa, chief Argentina strategist at Banco Btg Pactual in Buenos Aires.“This is like breaking both legs and then wanting to put a Band-Aid on it,” said Gabriel Caamano, economist at Buenos Aires-based Consultora Ledesma.Story continuesDespite one of the world’s highest monetary policy rates, inflation continues to surge in the country largely lacking credit as the Oct. 22 election unnerves markets and population at large.Front runner candidate Javier Milei earlier this week encouraged Argentines to stop saving in pesos as he’s promising dollarization — replacing the national currency with US greenbacks. His comments drew sharp criticism from investors, banks and politicians who accused him of exacerbating the selloff.The Argentine peso has suffered sharp losses in recent weeks, with the black market exchange rate weakening about 20% so far in October. Economy Minister Sergio Massa, who is the incumbent coalition’s presidential candidate, has frozen the official exchange rate at 350 until the election.(Adds comment from central bank officials and economists in third-sixth paragraphs)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Paige Hagy,"Best Buy CEO Corie Barry says we’re in the ‘funflation’ economy with $1,000 Taylor Swift tickets—and it’s why sales are worse than expected","Forget inflation. Best Buy’s CEO says we’re living in a ""funflation"" economy—and it’s hurting her business.“‘Funflation,’ Taylor Swift…those experiences are really where people are willing to pay,” Corie Barry said at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit in Dana Point, Calif., adding that this “means the bigger ticket items in electronics are not right now where people are interested.”Best Buy’s sales boomed during the pandemic, as workers invested in electronics for their remote work setups and entertainment, Barry said. Now business has slowed down as consumers spend on increasingly expensive necessities, like food and fuel, or luxuries denied during lockdown, like concerts and vacations.As a result, Barry says, Best Buy’s televisions and PCs are being pushed to the back burner. This was evident as electronics sales cooled more than expected during second-quarter earnings. Other sectors including appliances, pet supplies, and home improvement are also being hit by the recent consumer trend, Barry said.What is ‘funflation’? The term is a mashup of the words “fun” and “inflation,” to state the obvious—but it speaks to the curious spending habits that have been befuddling economists for years now. In short, higher demand for fun experiences drives higher prices for fun experiences. After years of being locked down, American consumers have been eager to get out of the house and splurge on items like Taylor Swift concert tickets, Barbie in theaters, and airline tickets.For instance, Swifties spared no expense for the Eras tour, spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on tickets and costumes, Fortune’s Alicia Adamczyk reported in March.This has also been called a “YOLO economy,” in which consumers use the mantra “You only live once” to justify their purchases. The term ""revenge spending"" has come into use as well, with Delta CEO Ed Bastian referring to the fun-seeking phenomenon as “revenge travel” and saying it’s a $300 billion market opportunity.Story continues“People talk about revenge travel, or pent-up travel—this is beyond anything that people can classify as truly pent-up,” Bastian said on Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast in June. “We went through several years of people not being able to get back out and travel and experience and see loved ones, see their business colleagues, adventures—all the reasons we travel. And people had a lot of time.”Something’s gotta give Overall, consumers have remained shockingly resilient this past year, despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in a bid to dodge a recession. People are splurging even as prices for housing, fuel, and groceries surge. Not to mention that student loan payments are back, further stretching millions of U.S. households.Their continued spending has been buoyed by savings left over from the government’s $4.6 trillion stimulus package, and a job market that “defies expectations” with low unemployment rates and hundreds of thousands of open jobs, according to Barry. But something has to give. For today’s American consumer, that means “nice to have” discretionary items.Best Buy isn’t alone. Target also pointed to Swift and the Barbie movie when its first quarterly sales dropped for the first time in six years.But “funflation” shows no signs of stopping, and retailers will need to innovate to get customers’ attention again. For Best Buy and Barry, that means relying on the intensifying integration of technology with daily life.“The greatest thing about our industry is innovation,” Barry said. “So yes, right now people are pulling back, but the future will only be more enabled by technology, and we are the ones that know how to commercialize that new tech better than anyone.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
Will Daniel,The inflation report just wasn’t very dramatic. Cue a range of wildly varying takes on Wall Street,"The latest inflation report just came in slightly above Wall Street’s consensus forecast, stoking debate among experts about the potential for more persistent consumer price increases than expected. As measured by the consumer price index, inflation rose 0.4% in September and 3.7% from a year ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday. That’s compared with a consensus Street estimate for an increase of 0.3% and 3.6%, respectively.Over the past 18 months, as the Federal Reserve battled inflation with interest rate hikes, economists have routinely warned that one of the key threats to the U.S. is “sticky” price increases. Inflation acts like a weight on the back of consumers and businesses; and when it persists for too long (or “sticks”), it can force Fed officials to raise interest rates to a point where a job-killing recession becomes unavoidable. Citi’s chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst, who believes a recession will hit the U.S. in the first half of 2024, explained in a Thursday note that he fears September’s inflation report was evidence of this type of sticky inflation.“Today’s inflation report is likely raising concern for Fed officials that signaled strongly earlier this week they may be finished raising rates. Rather than returning to 2% we have instead new evidence that inflation is stuck closer to 4%,” the Wall Street veteran wrote, warning that shelter inflation may be here to stay because rising mortgage rates haven’t slashed home prices as anticipated.Bank of America economists, led by U.S. economist Stephen Juneau, also argued Thursday that the latest CPI report is a concern for the Fed as it seeks to tame inflation without sparking a recession. They pointed to key areas that could be indicative of the need for further rate hikes, including the 1.5% increase in energy prices during September and “sticky” core services inflation—a category that includes a mix of components like tuition prices and shelter, transportation, and medical service costs.Story continues“In short, the report reminded us that the path to 2% inflation is unlikely to be smooth sailing and the Fed must continue to err on the side of doing too much rather than too little,” the Bank of America economists wrote.Of course, as is typically the case in this era of economic confusion, when sudden wars, pandemics, and technological advancements can throw off even the best of prognosticators, the most important takeaway from the latest inflation report really depends on who you ask.Some experts noted that core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices and is more closely watched by the Fed, matched Wall Street’s expectations in September, rising just 0.3% during the month and 4.1% from a year ago.Rick Rieder, a Wall Street heavyweight who currently serves as BlackRock’s CIO of global fixed income and head of the BlackRock global allocation investment team, explained that many market watchers have been particularly focused on the often volatile—and lately negative—monthly movements of the consumer price index, but he’s more focused on the positive long-term trend.“All of this excitement belies the fact that—broadly speaking—inflation has been making a seemingly durable downward trend, while at the same time the labor market has remained remarkably resilient,” he said Thursday. “We think the Fed is likely on hold for the time being, as it awaits more data, with the possibility of a final rate hike at year-end.”Some more bullish economists also pointed out that shelter costs accounted for half of inflation’s rise in September, despite the housing market struggling under the weight of the Fed’s rate hikes. The index for shelter prices, which makes up roughly one-third of the total CPI, rose 0.6% last month and 7.2% from a year ago.Ed Yardeni, founder of the sell-side consulting firm Yardeni Research and another Wall Street legend, noted Thursday that if you exclude shelter costs from September’s inflation data, both the headline and core figures rose just 2% on a 12-month basis, matching the Fed’s target.But why exclude shelter prices from the inflation calculation? Some argue that because home prices have risen less than 1% since June 2022, according to the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, it makes sense to discount the shelter category slightly when measuring consumer price increases. However, rent prices in U.S. cities have jumped more than 7% since last September, according to Fed data, which has left some experts concerned that we could still see a consistent rise in overall shelter prices.Yardeni lands in the bulls’ camp in this shelter argument—and when it comes to the debate over the path ahead for inflation.“Wage inflation is more persistent, but moderating. Rent inflation is stickier, but also moderating. Today's CPI report for September mostly confirms our assessment,” he wrote in a Thursday note. “Price inflation is turning out to be transitory after all.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
Steve Matthews and Jonnelle Marte,What Fed Officials Are Saying About Rising Bond Yields,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials are grappling with a run-up in bond yields since they last met in September that could obviate the need for further interest-rate hikes — and also threatens to derail a soft landing.Most Read from BloombergTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerIsrael Latest: UN Staff Given Evacuation Order for Northern GazaIsrael Latest: Army Urges Evacuation in Gaza; Mideast ProtestsVideo Game Cyberpunk 2077 Uses AI To Replace Deceased Voice ActorScalise Ends House Speaker Bid, Deepening Republican TurmoilAfter signaling one more rate hike was likely this year, policymakers in recent days have said the path is less clear, as they parse the reasons behind a surge in US 10-year Treasury yields that has led to tighter financial conditions. In the meantime, several officials have suggested the US central bank can hold off on raising rates at their next gathering on Oct. 31-Nov. 1, remarks that bond markets cheered.Here’s what Fed officials have said about rising yields:Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson2023 voter: Yes, permanentLeans: CentristPhilip Jefferson, who as vice chair plays a key role in communicating Fed policy on behalf of Chair Jerome Powell, said Monday he’s watching the increase in Treasury yields as a potential further restraint on the economy even though the rate of inflation remains too high. Jefferson said the central bank needs to balance the risk of not tightening enough with the risk that policy would become too restrictive.“Looking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields and will keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy.”Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan2023 voter: Yes, rotatingLeans: HawkishLorie Logan, a former New York Fed official, said Monday the recent surge in long-term Treasury yields may mean less need for the US central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate again. If higher yields reflect investors’ waning appetite to take risks rather than reflecting stronger economic growth, that means that financial conditions are tighter than they would be otherwise, she said.Story continues“Financial conditions have tightened notably in recent months,” she said. “But the reasons for the tightening matter. If long-term interest rates remain elevated because of higher term premiums, there may be less need to raise the fed funds rate.”San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly2023 voter: NoLeans: DovishMary Daly said Tuesday that higher yields could take the place of monetary policy tightening, which the majority of policymakers signaled as a preferred path of rates at their September meeting. Daly has said that the central bank can keep interest rates steady if the labor market continues to cool and inflation heads toward the Fed’s 2% target.“Recently, bond yields have tightened, meaning financial conditions have tightened,” she said. “If that’s tight, maybe the Fed doesn’t need to do as much. That’s why I said, depending on whether it unravels, or whether the momentum in the economy changes, that could be equivalent to another rate hike.”Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari2023 voter: Yes, rotatingLeans: HawkishNeel Kashkari said Tuesday he wasn’t yet convinced that a surge in long-term Treasury yields would lessen the need for further rate hikes, saying it depends on what is driving the recent rise in borrowing costs. He called the recent run-up in yields perplexing, and said it may be driven by growing optimism about the economy over the next five to 10 years or higher US government borrowing.“It’s certainly possible that higher long-term yields may do some of the work for us in terms of bringing inflation back down,” Kashkari said. “But if those higher long-term yields are higher because their expectation about what we’re going to do has changed, then we might actually need to follow through on their expectations in order to maintain those yields.”Fed Governor Christopher Waller2023 voter: Yes, permanentLeans: HawkishChristopher Waller, who has been among the most hawkish policymakers, said Wednesday the central bank can watch and see what happens before taking further action with interest rates as financial markets tighten. Waller noted the recent rise in yields, and said tighter financial conditions stemming from the bank crisis in March amounted to “a rate hike in and of itself,” though the broader credit crunch that some expected never materialized.“Now, once again, financial markets are tightening up and they are going to do some of the work for us.”Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester2023 voter: NoLeans: HawkishLoretta Mester said Oct. 3 that higher Treasury yields would lead to tighter financial conditions if sustained and are going to factor in to whether she sees a need to raise the federal funds rate further. She said rates might be rising because of stronger growth, along with concerns about the federal budget or fiscal spending.“We raised the funds rate intending sort of to change financial conditions and tighten financial conditions,” she said. “We’ve seen that 10-year rate go up quite a bit since, even since the last meeting. So that’s certainly going to feed into whether we think we need to, or whether I think we need to, raise the funds rate again. If it’s sustained, then that’s a tighter financial condition that will help moderate growth and moderate demand, bringing it into better balance with supply. So that’s certainly a factor I look at.”Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic2023 voter: NoLeans: DovishRaphael Bostic has been among the most dovish policymakers this year, making the case that the Fed has done enough to bring inflation back to the central bank’s 2% target. Asked about yields Tuesday in an event with bankers, he said rates are “clearly” restrictive, the economy is slowing down and more impacts from the Fed’s increases have yet to come.“I don’t think we need to do anything more in terms of interest rates,” Bostic said. “Interest rates are restrictive. Inflation is coming down. And if you want to have a measure of the degree of our restrictiveness, you compare what our interest rate is to what the rate of inflation is. And if our interest rate is higher than that, then we’re definitely, in real terms, putting a bind on the economy.”Boston Fed President Susan Collins2023 voter: NoLeans: CentristSusan Collins said Thursday that if the rise in long-term yields is “sustained,” it could lower the necessity for more rate increases in the near term. The Fed official said Treasury yields, mortgage rates and corporate bond yields are all “somewhat higher” than they were in mid-September. Collins has said she is among the officials who in September saw the need for another rate increase this year, and made it clear this week that further tightening is not off the table.“Importantly, the rise in long-term yields implies some tightening of financial conditions,” Collins said. “If it persists, it likely reduces the need for further monetary policy tightening in the near term. This reinforces my view that we are very near, and perhaps at, the peak” federal funds rate for this tightening cycle, she said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

Policymakers noted that the risks of overtightening now had to be balanced against keeping inflation on a downward path toward 2%, according to minutes of the September meeting released Wednesday.Several policymakers speaking over the past week have said that higher long-term yields may slow the economy, potentially taking the place of additional rate increases from the US central bank.Inflation data released Thursday showed US consumer prices advanced at a brisk pace for a second month, suggesting the Fed will keep the door open to another interest-rate hike this year. The so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs, increased 0.3% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Collins, who does not vote in monetary policy decisions this year, said a key question for policymakers is whether the declines seen in inflation will continue. “Today’s CPI release is a reminder that restoring price stability will take time,” she said.The Boston Fed president repeated comments she made on Wednesday about how the Fed can take a more patient approach to monetary policy now that rates are likely close to, and potentially at, the peak rate of the tightening cycle. She also reiterated that further rate increases are still possible.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Josh Schafer,Fed can stay 'patient' after inflation data as odds rise on a December rate hike,"Thursday's inflation report showed prices in September rose at roughly the same pace seen in August.But when removing volatile categories like food, energy, and shelter, economists see a downward trend in price increases, a welcomed sign for a Federal Reserve that had spent the days ahead of this data indicating a bias against raising interest rates again in November.Still, this data shows the Fed has work to do in bringing inflation back to its 2% target, keeping the possibility of an interest rate increase in December in focus for investors.As of Thursday morning, markets were pricing in a 12% chance the Fed hikes in November, down from a 41% chance a month ago, data from the CME Group showed.

Alicia Adamczyk,"Retirees’ Social Security cost-of-living adjustment will officially be less than half of last year’s, even though many seniors still haven’t recovered from inflation","Retirees and other beneficiaries will receive a 3.2% cost-of-living adjustment for their 2024 Social Security payments, less than half of this year's increase as inflation has cooled.This comes after beneficiaries received the largest COLA increase in 40 years this year, with payments increasing 8.7%, or over $140 per check, on average. Next year, the average beneficiary will receive an additional $50 a month.Around 71 million people receive Social Security payments each month, including for retirement and disability benefits.The COLA is an annual adjustment to Social Security benefits to ensure that they keep up with inflation. It is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W, a more general inflation measure than the headline Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, or CPI-U.Though it's less than the COLA for the past two years, next year's bump is actually more in line with the historical average increase, says Mike Lynch, managing director of applied insights Hartford Funds. For the past two decades, the average COLA has been 2.6%. In more recent years, it has been as low as 0%.Most elderly Americans depend on the monthly federal benefits, particularly those who are low-income. Many do not have other savings or sources of income to fall back on. Poverty among elderly Americans rose precipitously in 2022: The share of people over 65 living in poverty grew to 14.1% last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That's up from 9.5% in 2020.For those who aren't retired yet, Lynch hopes the annual COLA announcement is a reminder to make a plan for retirement and save for it outside of Social Security. While other generations could rely on pensions in addition to Social Security, most people in the current day cannot.""Retirement is really different than it was for other generations,"" says Lynch, noting that it is often longer as people live longer lives. ""Focus on Social Security, but also on all the other sources of income as well. We really have got to try to do everything we can from a personal savings perspective.""Story continuesLynch advises near-retirees and retirees alike to spend some time on SSA.gov, the Social Security Administration's website. It's a great resource, he says, that can help people better plan out their retirements.The Social Security COLA over the past 10 years:2024: 3.2%2023: 8.7%2022: 5.9%2021: 1.3%2020: 1.6%2019: 2.8%2018: 2.0%2017: 0.3%2016: 0%2015: 1.7%Beneficiaries will see the adjustment reflected in their January 2024 payments.Inflation may be moderating, but many seniors and others on fixed incomes have still not recovered financially after two years of painful price increases. Some have delayed retirement or gone back to work to stay afloat; others have tried to cut back on their expenses. Health care costs are especially onerous.While the 3.2% boost will be welcome by many, Social Security benefits have lost over 30% of their purchasing power since 2000, according to nonprofit the Senior Citizens League, due in large part to “inadequate COLAs.” Next year's increase will do little to solve that problem.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

That’s prompted some policymakers to suggest they may hold off on another hike when they meet on Oct. 31-Nov. 1, as they parse the reasons behind the run-up.Treasury yields rose following the latest price report, as traders saw roughly 50-50 chances of a hike by year’s end.Fed policymakers agreed last month that policy should remain restrictive for some time, while noting that the risks of overtightening now had to be balanced against keeping inflation on a downward path toward 2%, according to minutes of the September meeting released Wednesday.The CPI report showed a step-up in prices for services, which has been a particular concern of Fed officials led by Chair Jerome Powell, because they see the sector’s inflation as driven in part by a tight labor market.Story continuesExcluding housing and energy, services prices climbed 0.6% from August, the most in a year, according to Bloomberg calculations.“It boils down to services,” said Jay Bryson, Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist. “The last mile to get us back down to 2% on a sustained basis, that is tough. That is why the Fed will remain restrictive for quite some time to make sure that does come down.”Fed officials are trying to decide whether they need to hike their benchmark lending rate again after raising it by more than five percentage points over the last 19 months.They left the rate unchanged at their last policy meeting in September, though 12 out of 19 officials signaled they would support another rate increase this year, according to projections released at the meeting.Yet central bankers’ emphasis on patience means it will take additional data to persuade the majority of the need for another hike.“They’re pretty set on proceeding carefully and letting patience guide their thinking, so I wouldn’t count on a fourth-quarter hike unless the urgency ramps up with more data,” said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.--With assistance from Marien Lopez-Medina and Vince Golle.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
Alexandra Canal,"Inflation: Consumer prices rose 3.7% over last year in September, matching August's increase","Inflation moderated in September as energy price increases eased from the previous month and used car prices continued to decline, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed inflation rose 0.4% over last month and 3.7% over the prior year on a headline basis in September, a deceleration from August's 0.6% month-over-month increase and in line with August's 3.7% annual rise.Both measures were slightly higher than economist forecasts for a 0.3% month-over-month increase and a 3.6% annual increase, according to data from Bloomberg.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in September climbed 4.1% over last year — a slowdown from the 4.3% annual increase seen in August.

FATIMA HUSSEIN,Social Security benefits will increase by 3.2% in 2024 as inflation moderates,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Social Security recipients will get a 3.2% increase in their benefits in 2024, far less than this year's historic boost and reflecting moderating consumer prices.The cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, means the average recipient will receive more than $50 more every month beginning in January, the Social Security Administration said Thursday. The AARP estimated that increase at $59 per month.“This will help millions of people keep up with expenses,” said Kilolo Kijakazi, Social Security’s acting commissioner.About 71 million people — including retirees, disabled people and children — receive Social Security benefits.Thursday's announcement follows this year’s 8.7% benefit increase, brought on by record 40-year-high inflation, which pushed up the price of consumer goods. With inflation easing, the next annual increase is markedly smaller.“Compared to last year's 8.7% increase, this is going to feel small and the perception is that its not keeping up with the inflation and the higher costs that retirees are still seeing,” said Martha Shedden, president of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts.On top of that, an anticipated increase in Medicare premiums for 2024 will eat into the Social Security cost-of-living bump.Medicare hasn’t announced the increase for traditional Medicare, but said the cost of Medicare Advantage plans is expected to remain stable.Still, senior advocates applauded the annual Social Security adjustment.“Retirees can rest a little easier at night knowing they will soon receive an increase in their Social Security checks to help them keep up with rising prices,” AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins said. “We know older Americans are still feeling the sting when they buy groceries and gas, making every dollar important.""Social Security is financed by payroll taxes collected from workers and their employers. The maximum amount of earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes will be $168,600 for 2024, up from $160,200 for 2023.Story continuesRetirees whose sole income comes from Social Security are not subject to taxes on that income.Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the social insurance program, said that the COLA is a “reminder of Social Security’s unique importance"" and that “Congress should pass legislation to protect and expand benefits.”However, the program faces a severe financial shortfall in the coming years.The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in March said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2033. If the trust fund is depleted, the government will be able to pay only 77% of scheduled benefits, the report said.There have been legislative proposals to shore up Social Security, but they have not made it past committee hearings.A March poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that most U.S. adults are opposed to proposals that would cut into Medicare or Social Security benefits, and 79% of people polled said they oppose reducing the size of Social Security benefits.The Social Security Administration is still without a permanent leader. President Joe Biden in July nominated former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley to lead the agency.The COLA is calculated according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, or CPI. But there are calls for the agency to instead use a different index, the CPI-E, which measures price changes based on the spending patterns of the elderly, like health care, food and medicine costs.Any change to the calculation would require congressional approval. But with decades of inaction on Social Security and with the House at a standstill after the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., seniors and their advocates say they don’t have confidence any sort of change will be approved soon.The cost of living adjustments will have a big impact on people like Alfred Mason, an 83-year-old Louisiana resident. Mason said that “any increase is welcomed, because it sustains us for what we are going through.”As inflation is still high, he said, anything added to his income “would be greatly appreciated.”"
Laura Curtis,Accelerating US Core Inflation Set to Muddy Rate Picture for Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- A monthly report on US consumer prices due Thursday is set to muddy the picture for Federal Reserve officials trying to decide whether to hike interest rates again, especially as escalating conflict in the Middle East adds uncertainty, according to Bloomberg Economics.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: US to Offer Citizens Charter Flights From IsraelIsrael Latest: Hamas Leaders Targeted as Ground War LoomsApollo CEO Marc Rowan Demands UPenn Leaders Quit Over ‘Antisemitism’Goldman Sues Malaysia as 1MDB Settlement Dispute EscalatesIMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealThe consumer price index will probably show that headline inflation moderated in September. But core inflation — which excludes food and energy categories — likely crept up to between 3% and 4% on an annualized basis, thanks to a jump in used-car prices, Bloomberg economists Anna Wong and Stuart Paul wrote Wednesday in a preview of the release.“If the risks between inflation and growth have become more balanced in the past few months, the Israel-Hamas conflict has now tipped the balance once again toward upside inflation risks – just as pandemic supply bottlenecks have subsided,” Wong and Paul said.“Our baseline is for the Fed to hold rates steady for the rest of the year, but we see non-negligible risks of another rate hike, something the market is probably underpricing.”Read More: US PREVIEW: September CPI to Sow Doubt About Fed Rate CourseSlowing core inflation over the summer had raised hopes that the Fed would cease rate increases after lifting the target range for its benchmark in July to 5.25% to 5.5%. But high gasoline prices pushed the August reading up 0.6% from the prior month — the most since inflation peaked at a four-decade high in June 2022 — and core CPI accelerated on a monthly basis for the first time since May.Here’s what the Bloomberg economists expect:Year-over-year CPI inflation will fall to 3.6% from 3.7%, with annual core inflation decreasing to 4.1% from 4.3% prior.Goods inflation driven by used-car prices will be biggest contributor to the core CPI climb, reversing a three-month trend of negative readings.Inflation will remain sticky in some core services categories, such as car insurance, and physician and hospital services.There will be some good news on rents, however. Bloomberg Economics estimates the inflation of primary residential rents moderated to 0.4% from 0.5% and owner-equivalent rent inflation held steady at 0.4%.Story continuesWong and Paul warned increasing tensions in the Middle East may spur supply shocks and boost energy prices. If oil prices reach $100 a barrel, for example, headline CPI inflation could reach 4% by the end of this year, the economists said.“As long as inflation expectations appear to be anchored, the Fed likely will look through the price increase,” Wong and Paul wrote. “However, a sustained and larger oil shock could increase the risk that inflation expectations un-anchor, ultimately pushing the Fed to continue hiking rates.”Read More: Used Cars, Airfares Risk Slowing US Inflation’s Future DescentTheir predictions for the September report are in line with median estimates in a Bloomberg survey of outside forecasters.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

AMY BETH HANSON and HALELUYA HADERO,TikTok and content creators challenging Montana's ban face off with the state in federal court,"MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — TikTok and Montana faced off in federal court on Thursday in a case filed by the video sharing app and five Montana content creators who want the court to temporarily block the state’s ban on the platform before it takes effect Jan. 1.Attorneys for TikTok and the content creators argued that the state has gone “completely overboard” in trying to regulate TikTok and is essentially trying to implement its own foreign policy over unproven concerns that TikTok might share user data with the Chinese government.Christian Corrigan, the state’s solicitor general, said Montana’s law was less a statement of foreign policy and rather addresses “serious, widespread concerns about data privacy.”U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy said he would rule on the motion for a preliminary injunction as quickly as possible.In May, Montana became the first state in the U.S. to pass a complete ban on the app, based on the argument that the Chinese government could gain access to user information from TikTok, whose parent company, ByteDance, is based in Beijing.TikTok has said in court filings that the state passed its law based on “unsubstantiated allegations,” and that the state could have limited the kinds of data TikTok could collect rather than enacting a complete ban. Meanwhile, the content creators say the ban violates free speech rights and could cause economic harm for their businesses.Ambika Kumar, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in the Montana lawsuit, argued Thursday that the ban shutters a “forum for communication” that creators use to express themselves or make a living, and violates the First Amendment. She also said the state is relying on news articles to back its case and hasn’t produced facts to support its allegations regarding ties between TikTok and the Chinese government.Judge Molloy's questions and comments seemed to weigh in favor of the plaintiffs. He noted that TikTok users consent to the company’s data collection policies and that Attorney General Austin Knudsen could create public service announcements warning people about the data TikTok collects.Story continuesThe judge noted that everything Knudsen has said about the ban at hearings and in public statements “are directed to ‘we are going to teach China a lesson,’ not, ‘we are going to protect Montana data.’”Knudsen's office drafted the bill that blocked TikTok. He had also testified at a legislative hearing that TikTok is controlled by an existential threat to the U.S., that China sees war with the U.S. as inevitable and that it was using TikTok as an initial salvo in that war.Western governments have expressed worries that the popular social media platform could put sensitive data in the hands of the Chinese government or be used as a tool to spread misinformation. Chinese law allows the government to order companies to help it gather intelligence.TikTok, which is negotiating with the federal government over its future in the U.S., has denied those allegations but that hasn't made the issue go away.In a first-of-its kind report on Chinese disinformation released last month, the U.S. State Department alleged that ByteDance seeks to block potential critics of Beijing, including those outside of China, from using its platforms.The report said the U.S. government had information as of late 2020 that ByteDance “maintained a regularly updated internal list” identifying people who were blocked or restricted from its platforms — including TikTok — “for reasons such as advocating for Uyghur independence.”More than half of U.S. states and the federal government have banned TikTok on official devices. The company has called the bans “political theatre"" and says further restrictions are unnecessary due to the efforts it is taking to protect U.S. data by storing it on Oracle servers.The bill was brought to the Montana Legislature after a Chinese spy balloon flew over the state. It would prohibit downloads of TikTok in the state and fine any “entity” — an app store or TikTok — $10,000 per day for each time someone “is offered the ability” to access or download the app. There would not be penalties for users.The American Civil Liberties Union, its Montana chapter and Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital privacy rights advocacy group, have submitted an amicus brief in support of the challenge. Meanwhile, 18 attorneys generals from mostly Republican-led states are backing Montana and asking the judge to let the law be implemented. Even if that happens, cybersecurity experts have said it could be challenging to enforce.Molloy also pressed Corrigan on how the state plans to enforce the law on six of the seven Native American reservations in Montana where the state does not have criminal jurisdiction. Corrigan said the ban would not apply on those reservations.Enforcing Montana's ban would require TikTok to collect location data from its 150 million users in order to block those in Montana, the company argued in court briefs.In asking for the preliminary injunction, TikTok argued that the app has been in use since 2017 and letting Montanans continue to use it will not harm the state. Montana did not identify any evidence of actual harm to any resident as a result of using TikTok and even delayed the ban's effective date until Jan. 1, 2024, the company said.The battle over the Montana law comes as several other states are trying to curb social media use among children. TikTok, for its part, is also facing lawsuits from states like Arkansas, Indiana and most recently Utah over allegations that it leads children to have unhealthy social media habits and poses a risk for consumer data."
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,US inflation eased slightly last month as price increases extend slow descent,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Measures of U.S. inflation barely declined in September, evidence that consumer price increases are grinding lower at a gradual pace.Consumer prices rose 0.4% from August to September, below the previous month's 0.6% pace. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that year-over-year inflation was unchanged last month from a 3.7% rise in August.And underlying inflation declined a bit: So-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, climbed 4.1% in September from a year earlier, down from a 4.3% pace in August. That is the smallest such increase in two years. Economists pay particularly close attention to core prices because they provide a good signal of inflation's likely future path.Still, on a month-to-month basis, prices are continuing to rise faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Core prices increased 0.3% from August to September, the same as in the previous month.The report “was a mixed bag,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives, a forecasting firm. ""It still suggests that we have exited the higher inflation regime of the pandemic, but we’re still elevated.”Thursday's inflation data is unlikely to change the Fed's outlook, Rosner-Warburton said, because the central bank already expected only a gradual decline in inflation.“I don’t think this was an upside surprise to the Fed,"" she said. “This is probably in line with what they were expecting.""Rosner-Warburton, like most economists, expects Fed officials to keep their key interest rate unchanged at their next meeting in three weeks, which would leave it at 22-year high of 5.4%.At the same time, the policymakers will likely “keep the door open to more hikes in the future,"" she said, including at their following meeting in December.The main driver of last month's inflation was an uptick in housing costs. Rental prices and a measure that the government computes of the cost of home ownership, which together make up about a third of the total inflation index, accounted for most of overall inflation from August to September. Those costs also accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase in core prices compared with a year ago.Story continuesRental prices rose 0.5% on a monthly basis for a second straight month. Measured year over year, rental costs are up 7.4%, down from a 7.8% rise in August.Rosner-Warburton pointed to an unusual jump in housing prices in Los Angeles as accounting for much of last month's housing inflation, which may not be sustained. Economists have expected rental price increases to steadily moderate. They note that market measures of rents for newly leased apartments have cooled considerably in the past year as the construction of apartment buildings has jumped. It can take time for a decline in new rents to flow through to the government's measure.“We’re somewhat skeptical of the uptick"" in September, Rosner-Warburton said.Hotel prices surged 3.7% just in September after three straight months of declines, and airline fares also rose after a big drop in August.Higher gas prices helped drive inflation for a second straight month. Those prices rose 2.1% just from August to September, after a 10.6% surge the previous month. Gas prices have since come down; they averaged $3.65 a gallon nationally on Thursday, according to AAA, down from $3.84 a month ago.Fuel costs, though, remain much higher than pre-pandemic levels and have forced up shipping costs. That has created a burden for small-business people like Sandy Bialek, who owns Fatbat Brewing, a tap room in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Bialek said shipping costs have jumped for the malts that she buys by the pallet-load.She has had to raise the average price for a beer at her brewery to about $8, from about $6.50, to offset a range of higher costs. Her price increases, she said, have led a few of her regulars to quip, “What are you putting in this beer?”Many of Bialek's working-class local customers have cut back on their visits or drink less when they do come by. More of her business is now coming from visitors to the area.“I think a lot of people are hunkering down and saving and waiting” for inflation to pass, Bialek said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”The more that inflation persists, the more it erodes household paychecks and makes it harder for people to pay for necessities like rent, gas and food. Adjusted for price changes, average hourly wages fell from August to September for a second straight month, the government said. Inflation-adjusted hourly pay has risen by a meager 0.5% from a year ago.“As a consumer, especially if you haven’t seen the kind of wage growth that would help match the inflation growth, you’re probably still pretty frustrated with how high prices have been,” said Yelena Maleyev, an economist at KPMG. “And then, in addition to that now, how high credit costs are.”Consumers did receive some relief last month as prices declined for some goods. Clothing costs dropped 0.8%, though they're up 2.3% compared with a year earlier. Used car prices dropped for a fourth straight month, declining 2.5%. They're now down 8% from a year ago.Grocery prices, after soaring last year, have cooled. They ticked up just 0.1% from August to September and are 2.4% higher than they were a year ago.Economists and Fed officials have long cautioned that inflation would likely ease in a bumpy and uneven way, though it is still expected to keep slowing into 2024. Thursday’s inflation data follows several speeches this week by Fed officials suggesting that they are inclined to leave their benchmark interest rate unchanged at their next meeting Oct. 31- Nov. 1.Longer-term interest rates have spiked since the Fed’s policymakers last raised their key rate in July. Those higher long-term bond rates have led to more expensive mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing, a trend that could help cool inflation pressures without further Fed rate hikes.On Wednesday, Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s governing board who has previously backed sharply higher rates to fight inflation, suggested that price increases are steadily cooling, potentially allowing the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged. Optimism has been growing that the Fed can tame inflation through the series of 11 interest rate hikes it imposed beginning in March 2022 without causing a recession.“We’re in this position where we can kind of watch and see what happens,” Waller said. If core inflation stays as low as it has in recent months, “we’re pretty much back to our target.”Inflation soared in 2021 as the economy roared out of the pandemic recession. Consumers were ramping up their spending on furniture, exercise equipment and appliances even while supply chain bottlenecks contributed to widespread shortages. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine then sent food and gas prices spiking. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2002.Since then, supply chains have unraveled, and food and energy prices have risen much more slowly. In the meantime, the economy has remained largely healthy, and the unemployment rate has barely risen. The steady decline in inflation, without a spike in layoffs or a recession, has confounded economists’ expectations that widespread job losses would be needed to slow price increases."

Projections released at the meeting also showed policymakers expect fewer rate cuts next year than they did in June.Collins, who does not vote in rate decisions this year, said she expects policymakers will need to “hold rates at restrictive levels for some time” and until officials see evidence that inflation is sustainably on a path to 2%.Read More: Fed Minutes Flag High Rates for ‘Some Time’ While Risks ShiftShe also said that high inflation risks were becoming more “balanced” with the risk that officials slow activity more than needed to cool inflation.It may take longer for higher rates to hit some parts of the economy because many households and corporations built up cash piles, in part after locking in low rates early in the pandemic, according to Collins.“These factors have likely made the economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles,” she said.Story continuesCollins, who does not vote in rate decisions this year, said last month that further tightening was possible and that rates may need to stay higher for longer than previously expected for the US central bank to achieve its 2% inflation goal.Several Fed officials have said in recent days that a surge in long-term Treasury yields may lessen the need for further rate hikes.

That may reduce the chances of additional sanctions on Iranian oil and help prevent the nation and its proxies across the Middle East from being drawn into the conflict. Additionally, OPEC+ leader Saudi Arabia on Tuesday reiterated support for the group’s efforts to balance oil markets.Prices are also falling due to a bearish technical move known as a gap fill, which was triggered when prices surged more than $3 on Monday as Hamas’s attack on Israel raised concerns about wider instability in the Middle East.Such spikes often prompt corrective moves to fill the large break in prices before a new trend can be established, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities. Traders will continue to monitor the war and the possibility of more sanctions on Iran, which would be bullish for oil.The war adds another complicated dimension to global oil trading after prices surged in the third quarter as OPEC+ choked off supplies to tighten the market, then gave up some gains as demand concerns flared up. The move by OPEC+ leaves the US playing an increasingly vital role in supplying global markets, with the US government projecting the nation’s oil output will rise to a record this year.The US and Venezuela, meanwhile, are close to reaching an understanding that would bring limited sanctions relief in exchange for steps to ensure fair elections, according to people familiar with the matter.

Craig Torres and Steve Matthews,Fed Minutes Flag High Rates for ‘Some Time’ While Risks Shift,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve policymakers agreed last month that policy should remain restrictive for some time, while noting that the risks of overtightening now had to be balanced against keeping inflation on a downward path toward 2%.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Hamas Leaders Targeted as Ground War LoomsApollo CEO Marc Rowan Demands UPenn Leaders Quit Over ‘Antisemitism’IMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealGoldman Sues Malaysia as 1MDB Settlement Dispute EscalatesHouse Republicans Pick Scalise as Speaker Nominee in Trump Snub“Participants generally judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the committee’s goals had become more two-sided,” according to minutes of the September meeting, released in Washington Wednesday.“All participants” agreed that the committee was in a position to “proceed carefully” and that policy decisions would be data-dependent and take into account “the balance of risks.”To follow Bloomberg’s TopLIVE blog click here“They’re going to be parked on the side, but they’re not unpacking their bags just yet,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “They’re seeing inflation as unacceptably high — and that there are more upside risks,” she added.At the meeting, Fed officials held their benchmark lending rate at a range of 5.25-5.5% last month, and signaled rates would stay higher for longer than previously expected following one more rate increase this year.Since then, a surge in long-term Treasury yields has prompted some policymakers to suggest they may hold off on another hike when they meet on Oct. 31-Nov. 1, as they parse the reasons behind the run-up.After the minutes were published, the Fed-policy sensitive two-year Treasury yield and the dollar pared the day’s gains, while the S&P 500 Index pared losses.Rate DebateThe minutes noted that “a majority” of Fed officials saw one more rate increase “would likely be appropriate” to help cool off demand and get inflation closer to their 2% inflation target over the next two years, while “some” said “no further increases would be warranted.”Story continuesIn forecasts issued last month, 12 of 19 officials projected one more hike this year, while the median estimate showed they expected fewer rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.“Participants generally noted that it was important to balance the risk of overtightening against the risk of insufficient tightening,” the minutes said.Omair Sharif of Inflation Insights said the future of policy remains in a “tug-of-war” between the two risks. “The committee will proceed carefully,” he said Wednesday in a note to clients, adding that most “aren’t yet confident that inflation is on a durable and sustainable path to 2%.”The estimated higher rate peak, coupled with a slower pace of reductions in the next two years, sent bond markets reeling over the past three weeks. Yields on US 10-year notes jumped as much as 40 basis points from the Sept. 20 meeting through Monday, while spreads on corporate credit widened and broader financial conditions tightened.The rapid increase in borrowing costs appears to have surprised some officials on the Federal Open Market Committee, who suggested they may again keep rates unchanged when officials meet in three weeks.Policy PathFed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson on Monday told a conference that he would “remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields” in assessing “the future path of policy.” And Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said the same day that higher yields may lessen the need for further rate increases.Bond markets rallied after those comments and futures markets were pricing in about a 10% chance of a quarter-point rate increase at the next Fed meeting.Other Fed speakers on Wednesday advocated for a cautious approach on future moves.Governor Christopher Waller said the Fed can watch and see what happens before taking further action with interest rates as financial markets tighten. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the central bank doesn’t need to keep raising interest rates unless inflation’s descent starts to stall.The minutes noted that the economy is expanding at a solid pace, labor markets were reaching a better balance, and inflation — while it has cooled — is still running above target. The Dallas Fed, which trims away outlier prices from the personal consumption expenditures price index, calculated the six-month annual inflation rate at 3.1% for August, down from 3.4% in July.Fed officials estimate they need to get economic growth below the 1.8% trend rate to slow price increases.(Adds comments from economists starting in fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Federal Reserve minutes: Officials signal cautious approach to rates amid heightened uncertainty,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials regarded the U.S. economy’s outlook as particularly uncertain last month, according to minutes released Wednesday, and said they would “proceed carefully” in deciding whether to further raise their benchmark interest rate.Such cautious views are generally seen as evidence that the Fed isn't necessarily inclined to raise rates in the near future. Their next meeting is in three weeks.Economic data from the past several months “generally suggested that inflation was slowing,” the minutes of the Sept. 19-20 meeting said. The policymakers added that further evidence of declining inflation was needed to be sure it would slow to the Fed’s 2% target.Several of the 19 policymakers said that with the Fed’s key rate “likely at or near its peak, the focus” of their policy decisions should “shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long” to keep it at economically restrictive levels.And the officials generally acknowledged that the risks to Fed’s policies were becoming more balanced between raising rates too high and hurting the economy and not raising them enough to curb inflation. For most of the past two years, the Fed had said the risks were heavily tilted toward not raising rates enough.Given the uncertainty surrounding the economy, the Fed left its key short-term rate unchanged at 5.4% at its September meeting, the highest level in 22 years, after 11 rates hikes over the previous 18 months.The officials noted several sources of uncertainty. They include the strike by the United Auto Workers union against Detroit automakers; higher oil and gas prices; concern that an economically weaker China would slow growth in the United States; and the threat of an extended U.S. government shutdown. Since the September meeting, two of those threats have abated: Oil and gas prices have dropped. And a government shutdown has been avoided, at least until mid-November.The minutes arrive in a week in which several Fed officials have suggested that a jump in longer-term bond rates could help cool the economy and inflation in the coming months. As a result, the Fed may be able to avoid a rate hike at its next two-day meeting, which ends Nov. 1. Futures markets prices show few investors expect a rate increase at that meeting or at the next one in December.Story continuesOverall inflation, as measured year over year, has dropped from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.7% in August. The latest data on consumer price changes will be released Thursday, and economists expect it to show that annual inflation ticked down in September to 3.6%.On Wednesday, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed’s governing board, suggested that higher long-term bond rates, by making many loans costlier for consumers and businesses, are doing “some of the work for us” in fighting inflation. Waller also underscored the Fed’s cautious approach in his remarks in Park City, Utah, during a question-and-answer session.“We’re in this position where we can kind of watch and see what happens,” Waller said.But he also expressed more optimism about inflation than he has in the past, noting that the past three months of price changes, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, have been “very good.”“If this continues,"" Waller said, “we’re pretty much back to our target.”At their meeting last month, Fed officials issued an optimistic set of projections that envisioned inflation falling over the next two years, with only a small increase in unemployment and modest economic growth. The forecast raised the prospect of a “soft landing” in which inflation would slow to the Fed’s 2% target without causing a deep recession.Yet the projections also showed that the policymakers expected to keep their benchmark rate elevated well into 2024 to keep the economy from sending inflation up again. They showed that Fed officials expected to cut rates only twice next year. Previously, they had penciled in four rate cuts.“We’re fairly close, we think, to where we need to get,” Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the September meeting. “A soft landing is a primary objective. ... That’s what we’ve been trying to achieve.”"

Reade Pickert and Rich Miller,Used Car and Airline Prices Signal Inflation Is Here to Stay,"(Bloomberg) -- The rapid descent of US inflation over the last few months is likely too good to last.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israel Vows to Wipe Out Hamas as Ground War LoomsApollo CEO Marc Rowan Demands UPenn Leaders Quit Over ‘Antisemitism’Wall Street Brushes Off Hot PPI as Stocks Advance: Markets WrapIMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealHouse Republicans Pick Scalise as Speaker Nominee in Trump SnubNew upside risks in categories that have played an outsize role in the recent deceleration — like used cars and airfares — are raising the question: Can price pressures in services components like housing slow enough in coming months to sustain the downward trend?While many think the Federal Reserve’s own projections for underlying inflation over the next several months seem too high, there’s more agreement between the central bank and private-sector analysts that a return to the 2% target in 2024 is unlikely.JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman, for example, sees inflation in “core” consumer prices excluding food and energy snapping back to a run rate of about 3.5% annualized over the coming six months as used-car prices, airfares and health-insurance costs stop falling.“Do you think you could get the other components to decelerate core inflation on a run-rate basis by a percentage point to get you back down to where we are now, which is around 2.5%?” Kasman said. “I don’t think so.”Here’s a look at some possible bumps in the road in the months that follow Thursday’s September inflation report that help explain why the Fed and Wall Street economists see elevated inflation continuing through next year:Used CarsA surge in used-car prices during the pandemic helped kick off the inflationary cycle. They rose nearly 60% between June 2020 and January 2022, and have become an important drag on the consumer price index over the last year as prices have retreated somewhat.But ongoing shortages and the risk of production disruptions from the United Auto Workers strike could spark fresh price pressures in the months ahead.Story continues“Even away from the strike, I think a more structural, fundamental problem is that we continue to be really, really short on used cars,” said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights LLC.“Any time you have a pickup in demand for whatever reason, you’re going to see a spike in used cars,” Sharif said, adding that inventories aren’t expected to improve materially until 2025.The range of estimates for used-car prices in the September CPI report due Thursday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underscores how hard the category can be to forecast: Bloomberg Economics expects them to jump 2.2%, while strategists at TD Securities, for instance, see them falling 1.5%.AirfaresIn 11 of the past 15 months, airfares in the CPI — an important component in the broader core services inflation basket — have declined.While airfares may not actively fan inflation in the months ahead, they also probably won’t be as a reliable of a drag. The category itself is quite volatile, in part due to its close relationship with fuel costs.“The concern is that we’ve seen, now, higher energy prices driving headline prices for quite some time, which eventually, then, leads to a reversal in the core, or at least upward pressure on the core,” Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Stifel Financial Corp., told Bloomberg TV.A big wild card is whether the Israel-Hamas war spreads and impacts the flow of oil from the region.For now, the latest surge in oil prices has abated somewhat, and more fundamentally, global airline capacity is finally back to pre-pandemic levels.“You could potentially still see some moves up and down in airfares, but to me, a lot of that has honestly even wrung itself out,” Sharif said. “Capacity is back to normal. Demand is pretty stable.”Medical CareIn almost every month over the past year, medical care services have acted as a substantial drag on the CPI, largely due to the indirect way the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates health-insurance costs based on insurer profit margins. That’s set to begin reversing in the October report due a month from now.But the measure of health-care costs in the personal consumption expenditures price index — published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and favored by the Fed — is quite different. While the CPI aims to measure out-of-pocket costs, the BEA’s index is a broader measure and includes medical services paid for by employers and the government — like Medicaid.The trajectory of the PCE version will probably play an important role in shaping the overall path for the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge in the year ahead due to its weight in the index.Jonathan Millar, senior US economist at Barclays Plc, calls the health care PCE component “one that’s particularly susceptible to uncertainty.” He pointed to lingering cost pressures in the sector, noting outflows of medical professionals in the wake of the pandemic, as an upside risk.HousingHousing costs are paramount because they’re the biggest component of the CPI and among the largest in the PCE index. Rents for those signing new leases surged in the aftermath of the pandemic, but there was a significant lag between reality and when those price increases showed up in the government’s inflation data.The same is true on the downside. By some private-sector measures, rents outright declined at the end of last year, and growth has been relatively subdued in 2023. But it’s not exactly clear when those dynamics will be reflected in the official price indexes.There’s also a bigger question about the balance of supply and demand for housing. On one hand, a glut of multifamily units starting to come online seems to be pressuring rents lower. On the other, mounting affordability challenges in the purchase market — fueled by higher mortgage rates and climbing prices — may keep rental demand elevated.“There’s good reason to think that it will continue to decelerate,” Millar said. But “we are worried that given the fact that housing demand has proven to be so resilient, and this cycle seems like we have a structural shortage of housing, it wouldn’t be hugely surprising” to see rents re-accelerate, he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Business Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsEurope at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

Chloe Berger,Most millennials and Gen Zers feel they have it a lot harder than their parents did in today’s economy,"Part of growing up is realizing that some stories you were told as a kid aren’t real. Fairies typically lose traction by age seven, unicorns turn to fabled legends, and Santa is eventually revealed to be a fraud (apologies to our readers if any of the above is news). But the truth for some things don’t come to light until you’re older—at least for Gen Z and millennials, who are increasingly feeling like the American Dream that was sold to them is also fictitious.Nearly three-quarters (74%) of millennials and 65% of Gen Zers believe they’re “starting further behind financially” than other generations when they were their age, according to a poll of 2,000 adults conducted for USA Today by the Harris Poll. Mostly everyone else agrees; two-thirds of those surveyed thought young adults are facing hardships that other generations didn’t have to tackle. If the American Dream was ever a reality for some, it’s certainly not one that millennials and Gen Z feels they've experienced.“They're telling us they can't buy into that American Dream the way that their parents and grandparents thought about it—because it's not attainable,” Harris Poll CEO John Gerzema told USA Today, adding that there’s “an entire generation that feels like they're coming of age in sort of this fractured, divisive world.”The American Dream is baked into the nation’s promise to its citizens. Popularized in the 1930s by historian James Truslow Adams, it's synonymous with the bootstraps myth and idea that the U.S. is a land of equal economic opportunity and mobility. But, as researchers point out, not everyone starts out at an even playing field depending on their race, gender, and class. And in an economy marked by high inflation, rising wealth inequality, and a shrinking middle class, the American Dream is getting harder to come by. It’s largely not the economy millennials’ and Gen Z’s parents had to deal with at their age (although boomers did live through the Great Inflation of the 1970s), leaving younger generations to swap the white picket fence for an alternative living style or a rented apartment (which is expensive enough itself).Story continuesThe older cohorts of both generations graduated into ill-timed recessions—the financial crisis and the more short-lived coronavirus recession, respectively—and many of them are also shouldering massive student debt. Housing, one the hallmarks of the American Dream and building wealth, has become an especially elusive Carmen Sandiego figure for them in an overpriced market. After saving up and gaining some financial ground during the early pandemic, some millennials finally entered the housing market only to find themselves priced out by baby boomers who were able to offer all-cash bids. Finding an affordable house can feel like such a maze that 18% of millennials and 12% of Gen Zers think they’ll never own a house, per RedFin.The USA Today and Harris poll isn’t the first finding of its kind. Nearly half of Americans reported that maintaining a standard of living these days is more difficult than it was for their parents in one study from last year. Even those who are faring well recognize the plight in an economy where a $100,000 salary doesn’t go as far as it once did. SoFi’s CEO said that a worker making low six figures “really struggles to live the American Dream.” And JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the dream “frayed,” asserting that the country needs to start paying better wages and addressing the skills gap to ever survive on its last legs.Under such economic constraints, some young adults find themselves living at home or depending on their parents for financial assistance; many are worried that boomers’ actions will negatively influence their financial future, although a highly anticipated wealth transfer might provide some light at the end of the tunnel. But it might be too late for the American Dream.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
Kevin Crowley and David Wethe,Exxon to Buy Pioneer for $60 Billion to Dominate Shale Oil,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources Co. for $59.5 billion, the supermajor’s largest takeover in more than two decades, as it seeks to become the dominant producer of shale oil.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Netanyahu Talks to Biden, ‘False Alarm’ in NorthIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Israel Forms Emergency Government for War Against HamasStocks Waver on Fed Minutes as Traders Await CPI: Markets WrapIMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealExxon will pay $253 per share in an all-stock deal, according to a statement on Wednesday. The agreement paves the way for Exxon’s biggest acquisition since merging with Mobil Corp. in 1999 and is the world’s largest corporate takeover announced this year.The transaction amounts to an 18% premium for Pioneer investors, based on the closing price on Oct. 5, when reports of the impending deal began to swirl. If finalized, the combination will make Exxon far and away the biggest player in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico and bring the company’s daily production to nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day — 50% more than the next biggest supermajor.Exxon shares dropped 4.1% to $105.96 at 9:37 a.m. in New York. Pioneer rose 0.6%.The agreement will allow Exxon to boost daily output in the Permian region to the equivalent of 2 million barrels in 2027, or more than half of the oil titan’s current worldwide production. Exxon also pledged to reduce net-carbon dioxide emissions from Pioneer assets to zero by 2035, or 15 years sooner than originally planned, according to the release.Exxon’s inventory of yet-to-be-drilled sites in the world’s biggest shale basin will expand, giving it access to a vast number of potential onshore wells that, unlike deepwater ones, can be brought online within months and make Exxon far more nimble at keeping pace with erratic global demand. The acquired assets will turn a profit even if crude prices dip as low as $35 a barrel, Exxon said.Story continuesThe combined company will control the equivalent of 16 billion barrels of crude reserves in the Permian region, according to the statement.Exxon combining with Pioneer would also be the biggest push yet by an oil major into the Permian, consolidating a wide swath of the patch where production has been fragmented and largely the province of independent producers. When shale output in the basin began to boom around the middle of the last decade, big companies like Exxon were nowhere to be found.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysFewer and larger E&Ps dominating the Permian Basin remain our central theme, with acquisitions to build scale in the most economic and prolific of the biggest US liquids basin likely to keep up the pace even if Exxon Mobil doesn’t acquire Pioneer Natural Resources.— Vincent G Piazza and Evan Lee, BI analystsRead the full report here.Supermajors initially shunned the Permian because they were skeptical the wells there could produce sufficient crude over a long enough period of time to yield big profits. It became clear, however, that low-cost, easy-to-drill shale wells enabled companies to quickly ramp up production when needed. It marked a revolutionary departure from Big Oil’s offshore mega projects that cost billions of dollars and require a decade of planning.The Permian went on to become the western hemisphere’s most-prolific oil field, making the US the top global producer.The majors began to take serious notice around 2017, when Exxon bought drilling rights in the Permian from the Bass family of Fort Worth for $6 billion. Chevron Corp., Shell Plc and BP all went on to become big players there, too. Nonetheless, the basin still has more than 1,000 producers, and the majors only make up about 15% of overall production.Exxon has been hunting for another significant acquisition in the Permian for years. The stars, however, never quite aligned. The company’s finances took a hit during the pandemic as oil prices plunged and as it ramped up spending on large global projects, forcing Exxon to borrow billions of dollars to pay dividends.The war in Ukraine changed the landscape. Exxon had already been pulling back on spending, cutting costs and reaping the benefits of pandemic-era investments. Then Russia’s invasion sent oil prices surging. Exxon’s profits jumped to a record $59 billion in 2022. Its stock gained more than 80% last year, providing the financial firepower for a era-defining deal with Pioneer.The deal is apt to face tough antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission. President Joe Biden has asked the commission to investigate high gasoline prices and last year singled out Exxon’s record profits, accusing the company of making “more money than God.”Questions have swirled about a potential Exxon-Pioneer deal since April, when the smaller company’s Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield announced that he planned to retire at year’s end. Sheffield has worked in the Permian since the 1970s and is credited as an architect of the shale boom that made the US an oil powerhouse.Read More: How Shale’s Oil and Gas Reshaped the World of Energy: QuickTakeSheffield’s more than 20 collective years at the helm of Pioneer is one of the longest ongoing public CEO tenures in the US oil industry. He cut his teeth in the Permian basin more than 40 years ago, continuing to work there through the dark decades when supermajors including Exxon abandoned the basin to search for crude overseas. By the time drilling and fracking innovations developed in natural gas fields were adapted to oil deposits around 2010, Pioneer was well-placed to become one of the fastest-growing producers.Citigroup acted as lead financial advisor, Centerview Partners as financial advisor, and Davis Polk & Wardwell as legal advisor to Exxon.

Monthly inflation stood at 0.26%.The central bank has been applying half-percentage point cuts to the benchmark Selic, lowering it to 12.75% last month, after reversing the jump in consumer prices that accompanied the re-opening of the Brazilian economy. Inflation is now picking up again due to base effects and higher energy costs, though analysts expect cost-of-living increases to cool in coming weeks.What Bloomberg Economics Says“September’s CPI report was mostly benign and should see Brazil’s central bank proceed as planned with a 50-basis-point rate cut to 12.25% at its Nov. 1 meeting.

Meanwhile, food and beverage fell 0.71%.Story continuesAnnual inflation has now bounced back above the upper bound of the central bank’s target range. Policymakers target cost-of-living increases at 3.25% for this year, with a tolerance band of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.Analysts were bracing for price gains across sectors following hikes to fuel costs from state-controlled oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA in August. Services inflation, an indicator that policymakers watch closely, firmed on the month as the labor market in Latin America’s largest economy stays strong.“The continued strength of services inflation supports our view that inflation and interest rates won’t come down as quickly as is widely anticipated,” William Jackson, Chief Emerging Markets Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note published after the consumer price report.Read More: Hot Job Markets Spur Brazil, Mexico Economies Against All OddsFurther complicating hopes of steeper rate cuts, the recent surge in US Treasury yields is intensifying the weakening of the real, which has the potential to pressure consumer prices further.President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva plans to aggressively boost government spending next year — and doubts about how he will fund the 2024 budget are pushing long-term inflation expectations well above the central bank’s 3% consumer-price target for next year and 2025.--With assistance from Giovanna Serafim and Robert Jameson.(Adds inflation report details and analyst comments starting in fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaEurope at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
"Kevin Crowley, David Wethe and Mitchell Ferman",Exxon’s Historic Shale Deal Signals New Wave of Oil Mergers,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp.’s $59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., the biggest US energy deal in decades, is poised to usher in a new era of industry-shifting takeovers.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Netanyahu Talks to Biden, ‘False Alarm’ in NorthIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Israel Forms Emergency Government for War Against HamasStocks Waver on Fed Minutes as Traders Await CPI: Markets WrapIMF Caught Off Guard as China Strikes Sri Lanka Debt DealThe shale sector is a hotbed of consolidation talk as cash-rich oil companies compete for the best drilling portfolios in the Permian Basin, North America’s biggest source of crude. Output from that region of West Texas and New Mexico has doubled in just six years to the point where it yields more oil on a daily basis than OPEC heavyweight Iraq.That robust expansion has exhausted some of the Permian’s highest-quality drilling targets, and companies flush with cash from record profits are turning to acquisitions to shore up future productive capacity. Investors have a lot on the line because a deep bench of untapped reserves are the best guarantee that generous dividends can be maintained in the long term.“People are definitely going to run out of inventory over the next several years,” Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said during a conference call just two months before details of the Exxon deal surfaced. That dynamic “should lead to extreme consolidation.”North American energy companies completed $75 billion of deals through the first three quarters of the year, roughly flat with a year earlier. But when you combine Exxon’s swoop for Pioneer with all other proposed deals in various stages of advancement, this would be the industry’s biggest deal-making year since the pre-pandemic era, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Next up after Pioneer, all eyes are on CrownRock, one of the Permian’s biggest closely held oil and gas producers. The company run by Republican Party fundraiser Tim Dunn is up for sale and could fetch around $8 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. CrownRock didn’t respond to a request to comment.Story continuesHere is a list of other shale companies potentially playing some role in the consolidation of the sector:ChevronExxon’s biggest domestic rival, Chevron Corp., already controls Permian drilling rights across an area equal in size to Yellowstone National Park and has plans to push daily output in the region to the equivalent of 1 million barrels of oil by 2025.CEO Mike Wirth has been a savvy dealmaker, snapping up Noble Energy during the pandemic and Denver-based PDC Energy earlier this year after walking away from Anadarko Petroleum in 2019 to avoid a bidding war with Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chevron’s stock trades at 7.7 times cash flow, higher than all its oil-producing competitors in the S&P 500 Energy Index, giving it strong currency with which to transact.ConocoPhillipsConocoPhillips began aggressively expanding in the Permian Basin during the Covid-19 pandemic with its $13 billion takeover of Concho Resources, one of the region’s biggest independent explorers. CEO Ryan Lance followed that within months with the $9.5 billion purchase of Shell Plc’s Permian assets. ConocoPhillips’ stock has climbed 60% in the two years since then and its market value is now higher than supermajor BP Plc.Civitas ResourcesCivitas Resources Inc. has been an active dealmaker this year, expanding into the Permian with an acquisition from private equity firm NGP Energy Capital Management for about $4.7 billion in cash and stock. In October, the Denver-based producer reinforced its Permian position when it agreed to buy oil assets in West Texas from Vitol Group for about $2.15 billion.Read More: Civitas Follows US Shale Playbook of Buying Assets, Cutting RigsCoterra EnergyFormed through the 2021 merger of Cabot Oil & Gas and Cimarex Energy, Coterra Energy Inc. has been carefully searching for deals.“We’re going to be very cautious on M&A,” CEO Thomas Jorden said during a May conference call, adding that the company “would love to find a transaction” that adds value. “But quite frankly, a lot of the assets out there have peaked production.”Devon EnergyThe Oklahoma City company is seen as a possible takeover target because of its diversified footprint across five of the biggest US shale fields, with most of its output coming from the Permian. Devon Energy Corp. bulked up last year with a pair of deals that totaled about $2.7 billion.Diamondback EnergyDiamondback Energy Inc. purchased Permian explorer Firebird Energy LLC for about $1.6 billion in late 2022. Weeks later, it made a similarly sized deal to buy drilling rights from closely held Lario Oil and Gas Co. On a combined basis, the Firebird and Lario transactions expanded Diamondback’s Permian footprint by an area almost twice the size of Brooklyn.EOG ResourcesOne of the largest independent US shale operators, EOG Resources Inc. has shown little interest in big dealmaking. When CEO Ezra Yacob and other EOG executives are quizzed by analysts about the prospect for M&A, they typically say they’re focused on expanding organically and through small, bolt-on acquisitions.“We built this company on the success of organic exploration and we see that as the best opportunity for full-cycle returns,” Yacob said at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference on Sept. 5. “We’re not collecting cash on the balance sheet to do some sort of M&A.”Marathon OilWith assets across shale fields in New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas, Marathon Oil Corp. last beefed up its Lone Star State footprint in 2022. The Houston-based producer bought Ensign Natural Resources’ Eagle Ford Shale assets in South Texas for $3 billion in cash.Permian ResourcesThe eponymous shale driller’s $2 billion, all-stock agreement to acquire Earthstone Energy Inc. in August was the latest deal for Will Hickey and James Walter, the 30-something co-chief executives who have built Permian Resources Corp. into a major independent shale operator through a series of mergers.Permian hired Guy Oliphint, managing director and co-head of upstream Americas at investment bank Jefferies as executive vice president and CFO in January.--With assistance from Kiel Porter.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaEurope at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P."
PAUL WISEMAN,"Wholesale inflation in US rises 2.2% in September, biggest year-over-year gain since April","WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. wholesale prices rose last month at the fastest pace since April, suggesting that inflationary pressures remain despite a year and a half of higher interest rates.The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its producer price index — which measures inflation before it hits consumers — climbed 2.2% from a year earlier. That was up from a 2% uptick in August.On a month-to-month basis, producer prices rose 0.5% from August to September, down from 0.7% from July to August.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose 2.7% in September from a year earlier and 0.3% from August. The Federal Reserve and many outside economists pay particular attention to core prices as a good signal of where inflation might be headed.Wholesale prices have been rising more slowly than consumer prices, raising hopes that inflation may continue to ease as producer costs make their way to the consumer. But Wednesday's numbers, driven by an uptick in the price of goods, came in higher last month than economists had expected. Wholesale energy prices surged 3.3% from August to September, and food prices rose 0.9% after tumbling 0.5% from July to August.Last year, inflation reached highs not seen in four decades, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates aggressively. The central bank has boosted its benchmark rate 11 times since March 2022. Those higher borrowing costs have helped cool inflation and slow a still-solid job market.There are growing expectations that the Fed may decide to leave interest rates alone for the rest of the year. On Monday, two Fed officials suggested that the central bank may leave its key rate unchanged at its next meeting in three weeks, helping touch off a rally in bonds and stocks.Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said last month’s higher producer prices “likely do not change the outlook for Fed policy. Our baseline remains that rates are at a peak. For the Fed, geopolitical developments will be an additional risk factor which will likely keep policymakers proceeding cautiously going forward.″In the meantime, the economy has remained sturdier than expected. Optimism is rising that the Fed may pull off a ''soft landing'' — raising rates just enough to tame inflation without tipping the economy into a deep recession.On Thursday, the Labor Department will issue its closely watched consumer price index for September. Last month, the department reported that compared with 12 months earlier, core consumer prices in August rose at the smallest pace in nearly two years."
Josh Schafer,Market bets on Fed pause as yields rise. But inflation data could change that.,"Soaring bond yields might mean the Federal Reserve doesn't need to hike interest rates at its November meeting.In the past week multiple Fed officials have said the rise in bond yields are about ""equivalent"" to a rate hike, as San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly put it last Thursday.The news has sent investor bets heavily in favor of a Fed pause in November. As of Tuesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 8% chance the Fed hikes interest rates in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Last week, that probability was 28.2% and 43.6% a month ago.But some on Wall Street think Thursday's inflation print could shake up the dovish narrative.""Policymakers might take into account this additional tightening in financial conditions in the absence of further hikes,"" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote about the rise in rates on Oct. 6. ""We think, so far, the balance of risks is tilted toward a hold at the next meeting.""However, a firmer-than-expected inflation report next week might change this trade-off for them and they might feel compelled to do more.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/12036059/embed?auto=1></iframe>Thursday's Consumer Prices Index is expected to show inflation decelerated in September, after two months of headline increases. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, CPI is expected to have risen 4.1% over last year in September, a slowdown from the 4.3% increase seen in August.The report comes after last Friday's jobs report showed the labor market continues to grow but key inflationary elements of the report, like wage growth, showed decreases.""It was a good report, but it was not an inflationary one, which remains the presentable concern,"" EY chief economist Greg Daco told Yahoo Finance.The two reports are at the center of why the Fed has been hiking its benchmark interest rate since March 2022. A hot post-pandemic labor market and stimulus-loaded consumer wallets contributed to soaring prices. With inflation headed to a 40-year high, the Fed began boosting rates to try to restore price stability.Story continuesBut after raising rates to 22-year highs, the Fed has a chance at bringing down inflation without pushing the economy into a recession.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13073559/embed?auto=1></iframe>""What the market wants is this Goldilocks scenario where growth is strong but not too strong but at the same time inflation weakens,"" Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance Live.Rising yields could play a role in the path to the ""Goldilocks"" scenario where economic data is neither too hot nor too cold.""When the Fed says that the markets are doing some of the tightening in its place, what it means is that because long-term rates have risen, this then entails a higher cost of capital and high cost of debt for the consumer,"" Daco said.Put simply: The cost to borrow for everyone is increasing, whether it be your neighbor taking out a car loan or a major corporation hoping to invest money back into its business. As the cost to borrow increases, less business activity happens.""If it costs more to borrow, private-sector actors are going to borrow less,"" Daco said. ""They're going to invest less. They're going to spend less, and, in turn, that reduced activity then weighs on inflation, because if you have less demand, then you in turn have less inflationary pressure.""<img alt=""WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 20: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference after a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 20, 2023 at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC.

"Liana Baker, Kiel Porter and Kevin Crowley",Exxon Nears $58 Billion Deal to Buy Pioneer in Big Oil Bet,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. is close to a $58 billion deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources Co., underpinning a bet that oil and gas will remain central to the world’s energy mix for decades no matter what path nations take toward a lower-carbon future.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowChina Mulls New Stimulus, Higher Deficit to Meet Growth GoalExxon is in talks to pay more than $250 a share for the Irving, Texas-based shale producer, according to a person familiar with the matter. An all-stock deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday, said people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because it isn’t public.A final agreement hasn’t been reached and the terms could change or talks could still end without a deal, the people said. Representatives for Exxon and Pioneer declined to comment.An agreement at $250 a share would be a 16% premium to Pioneer’s closing price of $214.96 on Thursday, before reports emerged that the two companies were in talks. That would value Pioneer at at least $58 billion, based on its outstanding share count, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The deal would be the largest corporate takeover announced globally this year and Exxon’s biggest acquisition since merging with Mobil Corp. in 1999.

The region is the most prolific oil patch in the US, with a broad inventory of yet-to-be-drilled sites that could be quickly brought online to make Exxon more nimble at keeping pace with global demand.Story continuesWhile the US shale boom has been driven by independent producers like Pioneer, many of those firms didn’t survive the multiple downturns of the past decade. Now that the energy transition is making medium-term oil demand so uncertain, shale’s flexibility is an attractive proposition for companies like Exxon.A Pioneer sale may spark similar interest in shale producers from companies with strong balance sheets, like Chevron Corp. or Occidental Petroleum Corp., according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence.Read More: Exxon’s Move on Pioneer Is Momentous for ShalePioneer rose 0.8% to close at $237.41 in New York trading Tuesday, giving the company a market value of about $55 billion. The shares climbed as much as 3% more after the close of regular trading. Exxon fell 0.4% to $110.45, for a market value of about $442 billion.Exxon has been hunting for big acquisitions in the Permian Basin for years, but the timing was never quite right.

Laura Curtis,Fed’s Daly Says Neutral Interest Rate Could Be Higher Than Pre-Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said the neutral interest rate could be higher now than before the pandemic, though rates would not stay as high as they are now indefinitely.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowChina Mulls New Stimulus, Higher Deficit to Meet Growth Goal“5% is not going to be the new neutral. There’s no evidence that that will be the new neutral — that’s still the policy rate trying to fight back high inflation,” Daly said Tuesday at a town hall event in Chicago, coordinated by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.“I completely could imagine that we go from 2.5 — anywhere between 2.5 and 3 as the nominal neutral,” she said. “But that’s 50 basis points, not 250 basis points.”The US economy has shown surprising resilience in the face of the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign, which took the target range for its benchmark interest rate to 5.25% to 5.5% from nearly zero in less than two years.That resilience has prompted speculation that the so-called neutral rate for the economy, which Fed officials have estimated at 2.5% since before the pandemic, may have risen.For now, the central bank is trying to decide whether it needs to hike again in 2023 after leaving its benchmark unchanged at the last policy meeting in September.Daly, who doesn’t vote on rate decisions this year, is among Fed officials signaling that tighter financial conditions driven by a recent surge in US Treasury yields may reduce the need for more rate hikes. Yields on 10-year Treasury securities have risen about 25 basis points since the September meeting.“Recently, bond yields have tightened, meaning financial conditions have tightened,” Daly said Tuesday. “If that’s tight, maybe the Fed doesn’t need to do as much.

Jonnelle Marte,Fed’s Kashkari Says Yields’ Impact on Rate Outlook Is Unclear,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said he wasn’t yet convinced that a surge in long-term Treasury yields would lessen the need for further rate hikes, saying it depends on what is driving the recent rise in borrowing costs.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowChina Mulls New Stimulus, Higher Deficit to Meet Growth Goal“It’s certainly possible that higher long-term yields may do some of the work for us in terms of bringing inflation back down,” Kashkari said Tuesday during a town hall event hosted by Minot State University.“But if those higher long-term yields are higher because their expectations about what we’re going to do has changed, then we might actually need to follow through on their expectations in order to maintain those yields,” he added.Three Fed officials have said in recent days that a rise in Treasury yields may lessen the need for further rate increases. Investors see a less than 20% chance of another quarter-point increase when policymakers meet again on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, according to pricing in futures markets.“It’s hard for me to say definitively that because they moved, we don’t have to move,” Kashkari said. “I don’t know yet.”The Minneapolis Fed chief, who votes on monetary policy decisions this year, said he wanted to see further inflation, labor-market and wage data “for me to get comfortable that we’ve actually done enough.”Kashkari called the recent run-up in yields “perplexing,” and said it may be driven by growing optimism about the economy over the next five to 10 years or higher US government borrowing.Another reason could be that markets expect the Fed to be more aggressive in its efforts to keep inflation in check over the next decade, but he said, “it’s hard to see that that would translate to me to 10-year yields being up as much as they are, so it’s a little bit of a head-scratcher.”Story continuesKashkari also echoed remarks he made last month, when he placed 60% odds on the likelihood the Fed would raise rates once more this year and return inflation to its 2% target without causing severe damage to the economy.(Updates with additional Kashkari remarks in seventh paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Julia Fanzeres and Alex Longley,Oil Steadies Near $86 After Initial Jolt From Israel-Hamas War,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil steadied after the biggest jump in six months as markets digested the fallout from Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel over the weekend as well as the prospect of new economic stimulus measures in China.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Israeli Death Toll in Hamas Attack Reaches 1,200Hamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictAfghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha ShowChina Mulls New Stimulus, Higher Deficit to Meet Growth GoalNearly 2,000 people have died so far as the conflict in Israel, which has the potential for wider geopolitical ramifications, entered a fourth day. West Texas Intermediate settled below $86 a barrel after jumping more than $3 on Monday.While crude futures are moderating, rising tensions in the Middle East are keeping oil markets on alert, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities.“If we continue to see escalation between Israel and Hamas, it’s just a matter of time until it reaches into oil-producing areas,” Kissler said. “All eyes will be watching Israel’s progress and any intentions they may have into Iran.”While Israel and the Gaza Strip play a minor role in the world of oil, the Middle East accounts for about a third of global supply, and the market is still worried about potential threats. Stricter enforcement of US sanctions on Iranian crude exports and any blockades or attacks on vessels in key shipping lanes are the main risks, while the conflict also transforms the landscape for any potential US, Saudi and Israeli security pact.President Joe Biden said some 14 American citizens had died, with others likely held hostage by Hamas. Iran denied on Monday that it was involved in the assault.Meanwhile, China is considering new measures to help its economy meet the country’s official growth target. An announcement could come this month, people familiar with the matter said.Story continuesThe conflict has ratcheted up the volatility of oil prices, which have swung over the past month as concerns over high interest rates and slowing growth halted a rally that had been underpinned by Saudi Arabian-led output cuts. On Monday, options markets saw their biggest swing in favor of bullish calls since March 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was roiling markets.To get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter into your inbox, click here.--With assistance from Serene Cheong.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

He didn’t comment on the near-term outlook for interest rates.The US economy has shown surprising resilience in the face of the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign, which took the policy rate to 5.25% to 5.5% from zero in less than two years. The labor market remains strong, while inflation is starting to cool as supply channels normalize, more workers flow back into the labor pool, with possibly some increase in productivity.Waller strongly reaffirmed the 2% inflation target while noting that the other side of the Fed’s mandate — maximum employment — is a level that may vary over time.A rout in credit markets may suspend the need to tighten further for now, three Fed officials have said in recent days.Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson on Monday told a conference that he would “remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields” in assessing “the future path of policy.” echoing similar comments from other policymakers in recent days.Story continuesFutures markets are showing a less than 20% chance of another quarter-point increase when the Federal Open Market Committee meets Oct. 31-Nov. 1.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Josh Schafer,Bonds aren't 'out of the woods yet' — and that could mean trouble for stocks,"Treasury yields fell on Tuesday, easing off 16-year highs that had spooked markets over the past week.But Sofi head of investment strategy Liz Young told Yahoo Finance Live that the market's latest ""pain trade"" might not be over.""I don't think bonds are completely out of the woods yet,"" Young said. ""We also haven't seen very much weak economic data ... At this point there hasn't been a good reason for yields to come down and stay down.""Young highlights that yields are moving down ahead of the latest read on inflation expected on Thursday. Last month's Consumer Price Index report showed prices grew 3.7% in August compared to last year, an increase driven largely by rising energy prices. While economists surveyed by Bloomberg see inflation ticking down to 3.6% in September, Young is ""not super optimistic"" based on energy prices moving higher for much of the month.Higher inflation could prompt the Fed to hike interest rates once more. Recent research from BlackRock shows the 10-year Treasury yield has closely tracked the Fed funds rate during this and other hiking cycles.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15310045/embed?auto=1></iframe>The kicker for stock investors would be if reaccelerating inflation sent bond yields rising again.Stock price movements have been highly correlated to bonds recently.

Allan Sloan,Meet the real recession referees,"Scarcely a news cycle goes by these days without Wall Street types, various economists, and the occasional journalist opining about whether the US is headed for a recession or in a recession or isn’t likely to be in a recession anytime soon.Or whether we’re headed for a soft landing. Or a hard landing or some other sort of landing as the result of the terrible conflict in the Middle East.Are you confused by all this blather? If so, welcome to the club.And welcome to the world of the Business Cycle Dating Committee.The committee, created in 1978 by the National Bureau of Economic Research, is a nongovernmental, nonpartisan organization of academic economists that rules definitively on when recessions begin or end. It operates on the basis of economics, not politics.To avoid having to reverse itself, the committee doesn’t announce for months (or sometimes more than a year) after the fact that a recession has begun or ended. For example, it took until July 19, 2021 for the committee to announce that the economy had bottomed in April of 2020. That’s the committee’s most recent announcement.<img alt=""U.S. President Barack Obama&#39;s Council of Economic Advisers Christina Romer talks about her stepping down and returning to her position as professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley while on the North Lawn of the White House in Washington, August 6, 2010.

(Larry Downing/REUTERS)Given this time lag, why should you care about the committee?Because the information that it produces can help economists predict the future more accurately. And because understanding history can give you important context for helping to understand the present.The committee generally makes its calls from four to 21 months after the fact. “There is no fixed timing rule,” James Poterba, an economics professor at MIT, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a business cycle committee member since 2008, told me recently. “We wait long enough so that the existence of a peak or trough is not in doubt, and until we can assign an accurate peak or trough date.”Poterba has plenty of prominent company on the eight-person committee, which includes committee chair Robert Hall of Stanford and Christina and David Romer of the University of California at Berkley. (You can find the entire membership list here.)Story continuesEven though I’m a born skeptic, I trust the committee because unlike most of the players opining about recession, the committee is nonpartisan and noncommercial, and isn’t hungry for publicity. It also isn’t willing to offer any sort of interim opinion on our nation’s economic status.In addition to being dispassionate and honest, the committee has the best definition of a recession that I’ve ever seen: “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”I’m telling you about this committee, why I trust it, and why I think you can trust it, too, because it’s important to all of us to know and understand what’s going on in the economy.And it’s especially important not to buy into the widespread definition of a recession: two straight calendar quarters of a “real”— i.e., inflation-adjusted — decline in the gross domestic product (GDP). To give you an example, if the GDP rises at 2% and inflation is 3%, real GDP has declined.<img alt=""James Poterba, Mitsui Professor of Economics and President of the National Bureau of Economic Research, speaks at the Reuters Investment Summit in New York, December 8, 2008.

(Brendan McDermid/REUTERS)Jim Poterba told me that defining a recession as two straight quarters of declining real GDP can lead people astray.Let’s say, Poterba said, that we have two straight quarters of a tiny decline in real GDP — say 0.1% a quarter — but other indicators, such as employment and spending, remain strong. To say that two consecutive quarterly declines mean we’re in a recession would make no sense, he said.Or let’s say there’s a 2.5% quarterly decline in real GDP caused by a factor such as bad weather in the Midwest that hurts economic output, followed by a 0.1% quarterly increase followed by a 3.5% quarterly decline, with employment and spending both falling sharply. That wouldn’t be considered a recession by the two consecutive quarters of declining real GDP definition — but would clearly be a recession.One of the things that I also like about the committee is that when it makes a call of the economy entering or exiting a recession, it tells everyone about it at the same time via email.This way someone like me — I just signed up for the list — would see the committee’s ruling the same time Wall Street’s trading desks will. (You can sign up for committee reports by using this link.)Sure, signing up for announcements that come months after a recession has begun or ended doesn’t offer you any advantages in buying or selling securities. And it’s not as much fun as watching and reading people bickering about economic numbers.But it’s a much better use of your time and mental energy.Allan Sloan, who has written about business for more than 50 years, is a seven-time winner of the Gerald Loeb Award, business journalism’s highest honor.

Jonnelle Marte,Fed’s Bostic Says Rates Now High Enough to Lower Inflation to 2%,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic reiterated that he doesn’t think policymakers need to raise interest rates any further and that policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation back to their 2% goal.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: US Wants Qatar to Be an Intermediary With HamasIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingStocks Rise as Wall Street Dials Back Fed Wagers: Markets Wrap“I think that our policy rate is at a sufficiently restrictive position to get inflation down to 2%,” Bostic said Tuesday during a conversation held at the annual convention for the American Bankers Association. “I actually don’t think we need to increase rates anymore.”Bostic added that an unexpected change to the economic outlook could require officials to lift rates higher, but that’s not what he currently expects.Top Fed officials are uniting around the idea that tighter financial conditions driven by a recent surge in US Treasury yields may reduce the need for additional increases in their benchmark interest rate. Yields on 10-year Treasury securities have risen about 40 basis points since the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 policy meeting — to about 4.7% Tuesday morning.When asked how rising Treasury yields could affect policy, Bostic said Tuesday that rates are “clearly” restrictive, the economy is slowing down and more impacts from the Fed’s increases have yet to come.Read More: Fed Officials Head Toward Another Pause After Bond Yields SurgePolicymakers need to evaluate whether the recent increase in borrowing costs reflects investor expectations for a stronger economy or just extra compensation required to bear interest-rate risk. Parsing it will probably keep them on hold at least through their next rate decision on Nov. 1. Officials have raised their benchmark rate by more than 5 percentage points over the past year and a half, reaching a 22-year high.Story continuesThe Atlanta Fed chief, who does not vote on rate decisions this year, has been among the central bank’s most dovish officials in recent months, arguing that the Fed should stop raising rates and instead focus on how long to keep them high. Bostic said last week the Fed should hold rates at elevated levels “for a long time” to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.Asked about the recent violent attacks in Israel, Bostic said the turmoil could add new uncertainty to the outlook for the global economy, and emphasized that the Fed must be nimble and ready to adapt to changing circumstances.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Josh Schafer,The 60/40 investing strategy is broken. But it's 'far from dead.',"If the traditional 60/40 portfolio is meant to be a portfolio diversifier, it's not working. Recent analysis from Bloomberg shows the correlation between the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) hasn't been this high since 2005.So as bonds sold off last week, stocks followed, leaving nowhere to hide for 60/40 investors, who allocate 60% of their investment to stocks and 40% to bonds to hedge against market downturns.Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance it's another sign ""the traditional playbook is challenged.""Lerner and other strategists that Yahoo Finance spoke with pointed to the Federal Reserve's historically fast rate hiking cycle when explaining why the 60/40 portfolio hasn't been working like it used to.If things had played out as many expected over the past year, the US would be in a recession by now. Stocks would be down and more investors would likely be in bonds. Instead, a stronger-than-expected economy is reacting better than expected to tight monetary policy.""The economy has been less interest rate sensitive than most people would've thought,"" Lerner said. ""By this time ... If you were raising rates this aggressively you would've thought the economy would've slowed down more meaningfully, which also would've reduced inflation pressures even more and brought down yields on the bond side.""Callie Cox of eToro recently told Yahoo Finance that if there were a clear consensus that a recession is coming, bonds would be catching more bids. But as data continues to come in stronger than expected, what happens next for the economy has become convoluted.A resilient labor market could continue to support consumer spending while inflation tracks lower, setting the stage for an end to Fed rate hikes and a ""soft landing"" scenario. Or the resilient US economy could stay so strong it reaccelerates inflation and forces the Fed into further rate hikes, likely sending the economy into a recession.Story continuesIf there were a consensus favorite on those two outcomes, the recent market volatility and increased correlation between bonds and stocks likely wouldn't be present. But that hasn't played out. Even with yields growing increasingly attractive and fears of a ""higher for longer"" stance from the Fed haunting markets, few investors have fled to safety in bonds.Strategists don't think that will last forever, though, as the prospects of a 60/40 portfolio, and diversification from stocks, become increasingly attractive.<img alt=""Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, July 23, 2015.

She suggests something more like a 50/30/20 where the 20% is in alternatives like gold or private credit.""Alternatives have to be part of that discussion because ... they can often offer that needed lower correlation in difficult times when some major asset classes are closely correlated,"" Hooper told Yahoo Finance.Others say the recent moves in the bond market have now forced yields to a level that's made investing in fixed income more attractive.Learn more about high-yield savings, money market, and CD accounts.""As we're in a more normal interest rate regime a 60/40 portfolio is finally a bit more compelling than it's been for some time,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist and head trader Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. ""I get something on the 40 as opposed to just tying money up. Fixed income always has limited appreciation but at least now I'm getting paid for it.""Prior to the post-pandemic spike in yields, 10-year Treasury yields hadn't spent much longer than a month above 3% since 2011. In the past year, those yields have been in a range of 3.2% to nearly 4.9%. Yields on the 10-year and 30-year Treasuries receded slightly during Tuesday's session but are still hovering near recent highs not seen since since 2007.""The 60/40 is far from dead,"" Lerner said. ""You've had some restoration in those yields now to provide some buffer for the future, even though it's been a painful road to get there. I would say this wouldn't be the time in our view to be giving up on a 60/40 playbook.""""I would say short-term pain.

Jonnelle Marte,"New York Fed’s Perli Says Balance-Sheet Runoff Smooth, Eyes Risk","(Bloomberg) -- A senior official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the central bank’s balance-sheet runoff has been running smoothly with “no significant” disruptions to markets, but the Fed will continue to monitor for risks.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Biden Vows Full Support for Israel, Sends BlinkenSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingBrutality of Surprise Attack Unites Israel Around One Goal: Crush Hamas“Recently, our implementation framework has confronted a number of stress tests and performed quite well,” said Roberto Perli, the manager of the System Open Market Account who oversees the Fed’s portfolio. “This is all encouraging, but we remain cognizant of the risks and uncertainties ahead.”Perli spoke Tuesday in remarks prepared for the National Association for Business Economics meeting in Dallas.After raising the benchmark federal funds rate by more than five percentage points over the past year and a half, a majority of US central bankers at their September policy meeting projected it would be appropriate to enact one more quarter-point increase by the end of 2023. But some officials have said the recent rise in Treasury yields could further restrain the economy and lessen the need for additional increases.Runoff PlanThe US central bank is shrinking its massive balance sheet — after it roughly doubled in size during the pandemic — through a process known as quantitative tightening, or QT. The Fed has offloaded more $1 trillion in bond holdings since it began reducing its portfolio last year, with few signs of the financial market strains that spooked policymakers the last time they oversaw such a program.As the Fed removes liquidity from the banking system, money-market funds and other eligible financial firms are parking less cash at the Fed’s facility for reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repo.Story continuesThere is nearly $1.3 trillion parked with the program, down from the all-time high of $2.55 trillion seen at the end of 2022. If the balance-sheet reduction begins to eat more into reserves parked with the Fed, it could lead to scarcity and push the central bank to rethink the pace of QT.Perli said usage of the reverse-repo program could decline more, “possibly to low levels.” But he said officials will watch markets closely for signs of stress and that the Fed intends to slow and then stop its balance-sheet reduction while reserves are still above the levels considered “ample.”That moment has not arrived, and officials will be watching money-market conditions for signs of stress, Perli said. “The commitee will make that judgment based on careful analysis and market monitoring that incorporates price signals from money markets as well as extensive market outreach and intelligence,” he said.Perli’s speech mark his first public remarks since he started the role in February, taking over a position previously held by Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

A net 43% of small-business owners saw business conditions deteriorating in the next six months, the most since May.Small firms were also increasingly pessimistic about credit availability. The share of survey respondents saying it was harder to get a loan compared to three months ago increased to 8% on net — the most since March, when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates to the highest level since the early 2000s to tame persistent inflation. Officials have reiterated the need to keep borrowing costs higher for longer, triggering a recent selloff in the bond market.Here’s what else small businesses had to say about credit conditions:One in 10 firms on net expect worse credit conditions in the next three months, matching the highest share since 2012.About a quarter of borrowers on net said they now pay a higher interest rate compared to three months ago, matching the highest share since 2006.Small-business owners said they paid an average interest rate of 9.8% on short-term loans, the highest in data back to 2013.Respondents to the NFIB survey continued to rank inflation and labor quality among their single-most important problems. The share of small businesses who raised selling prices rose for a second month in September, marking the first back-to-back increase since early 2022.Story continues“Owners remain pessimistic about future business conditions, which has contributed to the low optimism they have regarding the economy,” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “The bottom line is being squeezed, leaving owners few options beyond raising selling prices for financial relief.”Hiring struggles were evident as well. Firms reporting job openings that were hard to fill rose by the most since the start of the year, to 43%. Those who said they had few or no qualified applicants for vacancies rose to 57%, the most in a year.(Adds graphic, tout to survey)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Grant Smith,OPEC’s Spare Oil Buffer Can Help Market Weather Mideast Storm,"(Bloomberg) -- Global oil markets may be facing heightened risk from tumult in the Middle East, but they’re better equipped to weather the shock than during previous crises.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkIsrael Latest: Biden Assures Netanyahu of US Support in CallSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingBrutality of Surprise Attack Unites Israel Around One Goal: Crush HamasHaving slashed crude output this year to prop up prices, Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ allies are left with a healthy reserve of spare production capacity. Outside of the Covid pandemic — when lockdowns caused demand to slump — it’s the biggest buffer in more than a decade.OPEC, primarily Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, will be sitting on more than 4 million barrels a day of idle capacity this year and next, about 4% of global supplies, according to the US Energy Information administration.That’s almost double the cushion they held during other regional crisis, such as when the kingdom’s Abqaiq processing facility was bombarded by Iran in 2019, or when Islamic State fighters captured huge swathes of Iraq in 2014. It’s almost 20% more than when Libyan output collapsed during the uprising against Moammar Al Qaddafi in 2011.After initially surging more than 5% in the wake of Hamas’s weekend attack on Israel, crude prices have since subsided back below $88 a barrel in London. That’s largely due to the lack of immediate threat to oil supplies, but it may also reflect the reassuring impact of OPEC’s spare oil.Whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners could ultimately dip into that trove isn’t clear. Riyadh has chosen to squeeze supplies so far this year, pushing prices to almost $100 a barrel last month. The deciding factor may be whether Iran, the main backer of Hamas, faces tighter US sanctions on its oil exports as a result of the current crisis.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaCan AI Beat the Market?

Eleanor Pringle,Janet Yellen says inflation is actually being ‘really well-behaved’ as she denies strong jobs report that scared markets is anything other than a good thing,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is confident that American consumers, businesses, and banks will be able to survive rising interest rates—and believes the Fed’s battle to slay the inflation dragon appears to be going rather well.Yellen, who arrived in Marrakech this week for the IMF and World Bank annual meeting, also dismissed fears that a strong jobs report could actually prove to be a negative for the economy.Yellen noted that core inflation—which excludes fast-moving prices in food and energy—is actually “really well-behaved,” while speaking to the Financial Times.Over the past 12 months inflation has been slashed, as the Fed raised rates to their highest levels in 22 years this summer to now sit at 5.5%.It seems to be working. In August 2023, inflation sat at 3.7%, down from 8.3% the year prior. The August figure was also driven in part by an increase in oil which peaked at $3.984 per gallon in the third week of the month.Yellen also refused to concede that a strong jobs report for September was anything other than a good thing for the U.S. economy.The jobs report, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed the economy added approximately 336,000 roles in the month, considerably higher than August’s net gain of 227,000 jobs.Seemingly great news, right? Wrong. The market reacted skittishly, fearing a strong labor report could push the Fed into keeping rates higher for longer.Yellen dismissed such concerns, saying the report was “impressive” and should be seen as “positive, not a negative."" She added that after all, the report implies “more people wanting to work and finding jobs.”“What could be a problem is if we saw the labor market overheating, but I didn’t really see evidence here of that,” she added.What about the bond rout?Wall Street is less convinced by Yellen’s take on the jobs report, indicating its discomfort by a further selloff in the bond market.The U.S. Treasury market—the foundation of much of the global financial system—is currently seeing a 16-year-high in its 10-year bond yields. The selloff isn't just a headache for U.S. officials, as an increase in the cost of borrowing in the U.S. also lifts costs around the world.Story continuesBut Yellen remained unfazed by the notion that interest rates are causing any “dysfunction” in the American market.“I haven’t seen any evidence of dysfunction in connection with the increase in interest rates. When rates are more volatile, sometimes you see some impact on market function, but that is pretty standard,” she said.Her confidence was echoed, to some extent, by Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel who wrote the economy’s strength shouldn’t lead the Fed to push for any further rate hikes.“Is the economy too strong?” professor Siegel pondered in his Wisdom Tree weekly blog. “Yields jumped in reaction to the employment report because there’s worry the Fed will stay higher for longer. The initial equity market reaction to the employment report was a drop, but it closed on Friday much stronger—which I think is the right reaction.“He added that “none” of the data—no matter how strong—led him to think the Fed would increase rates again, given the fact there are still so many uncertainties in the economy.These include the UAW strike, some weakness in the housing market, and the continued threat of a government shutdown.“I don’t think a one-tenth higher than expected inflation will force the Fed to hike,” professor Siegel noted. “Maybe 0.2% to 0.3% hotter than expected inflation might cause to the Fed to hike.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
WAYNE PARRY,"Casino industry spurs $329 billion in US economic activity, study by gambling group shows","ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — The casino gambling industry in the U.S. generates nearly $329 billion a year in economic activity, according to a new study by the industry's national trade association.The American Gaming Association released a study Monday showing the industry's economic impact in 2022 was up 26% from 2017, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.Commercial and tribal casinos support 1.8 million jobs, including 700,000 jobs at casinos themselves or related businesses, about the same as in 2017. Those jobs generated $104 billion in wages across the country, up 40% from 2017, according to the study.The industry paid $52.7 billion last year in taxes to federal, state and local governments, up 29% since 2017, the report said.The report was the first such study released by the association since 2018, which presented 2017 data.Bill Miller, president and CEO of the association, said the numbers show the casino industry's “resiliency and continued strength” since the pandemic first hit.“Think back to where we were a few years ago with nearly 1,000 casinos, almost all of them closed,” he said. “Today, we're seeing record revenue in the industry.”Miller said the association will use numbers from the survey to press its case to lawmakers in favor of gambling industry goals, including a government crackdown on unlicensed gambling operations.The U.S. casino industry is having its best year ever this year in terms of the amount of money won from gamblers. It is on a pace to exceed the $60 billion it won from gamblers last year.“I think it speaks to the continuing popularity of casino gambling in the United States,” said David Schwartz, a gambling historian at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. “Despite some economic headwinds, casinos remain powerful drivers of economic activity.”Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at New Jersey's Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry, said money won by casinos is just part of their overall contribution to the nation's economy.Story continues“Casinos are often the largest employers in a region, with major commitments in terms of wages and benefits,” she said. “People employed by casinos use those wages and benefits to purchase additional goods and services, generating secondary economic impact.”Bokunewicz said casinos spend significant sums on operating costs, including purchases of goods and services like food, linen, hotel room amenities, laundry services, and building maintenance. They also hire local builders and vendors for construction and ongoing capital improvements.The survey examined money won from gamblers or spent at non-gambling casino businesses like restaurants and stores, including traditional casino games, sports betting and online gambling. Also surveyed was capital investment, including the building and opening of new casinos or renovations to existing ones, and spending by manufacturers of gambling devices including slot machines.It included supply chain spending by casinos, and spending by casino workers on non-gambling items. And it also included $13.5 billion in so-called catalytic spending by casino patrons outside casinos, on things like transportation to and from a casino resort, and money spent at restaurants that are not part of casinos.Commercial casinos employed almost 332,000 workers last year, who earned $16.3 billion in wages and benefits, and tribal casinos employed almost 265,000 workers, who earned $8 billion in wages and benefits. There also were almost 89,000 jobs at businesses serving casino patrons during trips or in casino construction and renovations, and more than 23,000 jobs at gambling equipment manufacturers.Non-gambling revenue accounted for nearly 17% of casino revenue last year, including money from food and beverage sales, hotel rooms and other items.___Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly known as Twitter, at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC"

That’s slightly above the 11.3% monthly inflation expected for September by an average of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg, which puts annual price gains at 135%, the highest since the country was exiting hyperinflation in early 1990s.BCRA has refrained from boosting borrowing costs further after lifting them by 21 percentage points in mid-August, when the government ordered a sharp devaluation of the official exchange rate. Heightened volatility linked to Argentina’s upcoming presidential election on Oct. 22., coupled with a historic drought that cost the economy $20 billion of exports, has sent prices soaring and activity down as a recession looms.Read More: IMF’s $43 Billion Argentina Problem Is About to Get WorseOutsider candidate Javier Milei, who’s the frontrunner in the election after winning a primary in August, is openly pushing Argentines to get rid of their pesos as he advocates to dollarize the economy if elected.Story continuesDespite the central bank tightening monetary policy, the pressure on the Argentine currency continues as the black market exchange rate weakened to a record low of 945 pesos per dollar Monday and the gap between the official rate and informal rates reached 170%.

Will Daniel,"War in Israel, oil shocks, and roaring inflation, Deutsche Bank sees ‘a striking number of parallels’ with the 1970s","Hamas’s surprise attack against Israel has fanned the flames of an age-old conflict in the Middle East and sparked fears that the global economy faces a repeat of the turbulent 1970s. Almost exactly 50 years ago, an oil price shock caused by the Yom Kippur War and subsequent crude embargoes against nations that supported Israel in the conflict helped usher in a decade of stagflation—a toxic mix of weak economic growth and spiraling inflation. Now, as the current war in Israel continues to escalate, Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist Henry Allen can’t help but feel a sense of déjà vu.“As we look back at the 1970s today, there are a striking number of parallels with our own time,” the Wall Street veteran wrote in a Monday note. “Over the weekend, the attacks on Israel showed how geopolitical risk can return unexpectedly.”Anemic economic growth and crushing, stubborn inflation were the status quo in much of the 1970s—not just in the U.S., but worldwide. Between 1973 and 1983, as GDP growth rates plummeted in many nations, inflation averaged 11.3% globally, more than three times the average of the previous decade. Allen’s main fear is that we could see a repeat of this type of persistent inflation during the 2020s. He pointed to a number of reasons why he’s so concerned on Monday, from the threat of another oil price shock to growing “industrial unrest” from workers that can be seen in union strikes.Parallels to the 1970s""The most obvious parallel between the 2020s and the 1970s has been the surge in energy prices, particularly that of oil,"" according to Allen.The 1970s saw two major oil price shocks caused by wars in the Middle East that exacerbated inflation globally.The first came in October 1973, when OPEC, which then was called the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OAPEC, cut its oil production and imposed an embargo on a number of nations for supporting Israel in its fight against a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria during the Yom Kippur War. The move led the price of a barrel of oil to jump 300% from $2.90 to $11.65 in just four months.Story continuesSimilarly, the Russia-Ukraine war and subsequent sanctions against the West for its support of Ukraine lifted oil prices from around $80 per barrel at the start of 2022 to over $139 in just three months. Prices then slowly retreated to a low of around $74 this June, but supply-demand imbalances have led to a steady rise ever since. And the Israel-Hamas war threatens to bring back another bad memory from the 1970s—a second oil shock.In 1979, the Iranian Revolution crippled Iran’s oil production, reducing global crude output by roughly 7%. Then the Iran-Iraq War began in 1980, leading to further cuts in oil production. Crude prices rose from under $10 per barrel in early 1979 to $34 per barrel by February 1981 as a result.“These supply shocks caused serious difficulties for the economy, both in the 1970s and today, since they push up inflation and dampen growth at the same time,” Allen explained, noting that rising oil prices have put central banks in a tough spot as they continue their inflation fight amid fading global economic growth.However, Capital Economics’ deputy chief markets strategist Jonas Goltermann said he doesn’t believe the latest conflict in the Middle East will have as dramatic of an impact on oil prices as past wars have.""It would take a major escalation for this conflict to generate a shock comparable to the one in 1973 following the first Yom Kippur War. Back then the oil price quadrupled over the space of a few months; such an outcome remains a tail risk scenario,"" he wrote in a Monday note.Putting the potential for another oil price shock aside, Deutsche Bank’s Allen noted that inflation still remains well above central banks’ targets in many nations worldwide, just as it did in the 1970s. And in another repeat of history, economists may be a bit too optimistic about the path ahead for consumer prices.“Forecasts were repeatedly too optimistic in the 1970s, as the persistence of inflation was underestimated,” he wrote, explaining that there has been a “similar phenomenon” in the 2020s, which could lead central banks to be too dovish. “Now is not a time to get complacent…the 1970s showed how unexpected shocks could rapidly send inflation higher once again.”The number of striking workers is also on the rise in a repeat of the 1970s. Actors, screenwriters, autoworkers, journalists, and more have all taken drastic steps to push for higher wages to compensate for inflation in recent years.In the 1970s and early 1980s, U.S. workers regularly saw their wages rise by 7%, 8% or as much as 9% annually to compensate for rising prices. But some economists believe the persistent wage increases helped exacerbate inflation and fear current worker strikes could do the same.The good news, according to Allen, is “even as the number of strikes reaches its highest in decades, the scale of the industrial action is at just a fraction of its levels in the 1970s.”Still, striking workers and oil price shocks are definitely reminiscent of the disco era, and even the weather is feeling a lot like the ’70s. “We are also seeing an El Niño event this year, which echoes a similar event in the early 1970s that put upward pressure on food prices,” Allen warned, adding that “there is a clear risk that it could create another inflationary shock.”El Niño events can cause warmer and drier winters in North America, reducing crop yields.This year, the U.S. Climate Prediction Center estimates that there is a 73% chance that there will be a “strong” El Niño event.Reasons for optimismWhile there are certainly a lot of similarities between the 1970s and today, there are also a number of differences and reasons to believe the global economy can avoid stagflation.First, central banks around the world have raised interest rates aggressively to counter the rise of inflation, which was ultimately how consumer price increases were slowed in the early ’80s. Second, after years of supply-chain inflation, Allen said that supply chains have “broadly healed.” The New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index—which measures constraints caused by supply chains worldwide—has dropped back below its long-term average after hitting a record high in late 2021.Commodity prices, overall, are also still from their post-Russia invasion peak; consumers’ inflation expectations remain anchored; and the U.S. economy is far less energy intensive than it once was due to a number of factors, including a reduced emphasis on industrial production and new vehicle efficiency standards. U.S. energy intensity—a measure of primary energy consumption per real GDP dollar—has fallen nearly 80% since 1950, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.“An energy shock in the 1970s was capable of causing far more economic damage than today, because our economies were much more reliant on energy,” Allen explained.Summing it all up, the veteran strategist said that there have been “a lot of promising signs that a return to the 1970s can be avoided,” but the latest conflict in the Middle East means “it is too early to sound the all-clear.”“After all, inflation is still above target in every G7 country, even if it has come down from its peak. We saw in the 1970s how fresh shocks can lead to expectations becoming unanchored, particularly if they already follow a period where inflation has been above target. At the same time, growth remains sluggish in several countries, and relative to recent years, policymakers face more constraints when stimulating the economy,” he wrote.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
Josh Schafer,Oil prices surge as surprise attack on Israel sparks fears of broader conflict,"Oil prices jumped more than 4% Monday morning after a surprise attack on Israel by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas fueled concerns of broader conflict breaking out in the Middle East region.West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent International (BZ=F) futures jumped about 4% to about $86 a barrel and $88 per barrel, respectively. The more than $3.50 rise in WTI crude oil marked the largest intraday move since April.Hamas over the weekend launched the biggest military assault on Israel in decades. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel's response to the attack will ""change the Middle East.""The Middle East accounts for more than 30% of the world's oil production.""There has been no oil supply disruption,"" Lipow Oil Associates president Andy Lipow wrote in a note on Monday morning. ""The oil market knee jerk reaction is to move higher on the fear that the conflict will spread, eventually drawing Iran into the conflict and impacting the transit of oil through the Strait of Hormuz.""Lipow noted that Iran's involvement will be key in determining how much the conflict could impact oil prices. The Strait of Hormuz, which is located between Oman and Iran, produces 17 million-18 million barrels of oil per day. If closed, that could result in a $20 to $30 per barrel increase in oil prices and a surge in gasoline prices in America.For now, though, Lipow believes the conflict won't impact gas prices' path downward.Oil prices have been in focus over the past several months as a surge at the end of September had some analysts calling for $100 per barrel prices amid a supply shock across the market. But those prices had receded recently as ""demand destruction"" had begun in energy.Fundstrat's head of research Tom Lee says the lack of oil demand should limit Monday's price spike.""Expect [oil] to initially rise on geopolitical risk, but demand is weak,"" Lee wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""So this will fade.""Story continuesOil's massive move higher had been flagged by many on the Street as a drag on the economy. Goldman Sachs called the headwind ""manageable"" while others were concerned about how rising oil prices, combined with other factors like the auto strike, the resumption of student loan payments, and a potential government shutdown, could hit growth.<img alt=""NOLAN, TEXAS - OCTOBER 04: An oil pumpjack is seen near a field of wind turbines on October 04, 2023 in Nolan, Texas.

Julia Fanzeres and Alex Longley,Oil Surges as Israel Conflict Reignites Middle East Volatility,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil prices surged after a shock attack on Israel by Hamas brought renewed instability to the Middle East.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkBrutality of Surprise Attack Unites Israel Around One Goal: Crush HamasXi’s Reply to Hamas Attack Shows China’s Limit as PeacemakerMore than 1,400 people have died since the fighting between Israel and militant group Hamas broke out over the weekend, in a conflict that has potential repercussions across the wider region. US crude futures settled above $86 a barrel, at one point rallying 5.4%.While Israel’s role in global oil supply is limited, the bloody outbreak threatens to embroil both the US and Iran. Iran has become a major source of extra crude this year, alleviating otherwise tightening markets, but additional American sanctions on Tehran could constrain those shipments.“Recently crude has been prone to overreact to geopolitical events and price increases have been short-lived,” said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. “This situation may prove to be the exception,” with the market especially sensitive to potential supply disruptions.Any retaliation against Tehran — amid reports that it helped to plan the attacks — could endanger the passage of vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital conduit that transports much of the world’s crude and which the Iranian government previously threatened to close. Iran denied on Monday that it was involved in the assault.The surge after the attacks added a fresh bout of volatility to a market that has seen sizable swings over the last month. In late September, Brent was on course to rally up to $100 a barrel as cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia tightened the market, before retreating sharply last week as concerns about consumption and financial flows pulled prices lower.Story continuesEarly trading on Monday saw a flurry of bullish activity in the Brent options markets, with call options that profit from higher oil prices outpacing — by more than three-to-one — bearish put options.Read More: What Oil Watchers Have to Say About Impact of Hamas’ AttacksThe conflict may have far-reaching consequences for crude.

Risks are also growing that Israel will attack Iran, analysts including Ed Morse said.Morgan Stanley said that they thought the impact of the conflict would be limited. For now they don’t expect a spillover into other countries, meaning there will be a muted longer-term impact on crude prices.Societe Generale SA said heightened geopolitical tensions could add $5-$10 risk premium to crude prices.RBC Capital Markets analysts including Helima Croft said Israel will likely escalate a long-running shadow war against Iran, but Tehran’s response to such a move will be less clear.To get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter into your inbox, click here.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraA Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Native Art Is a $1.5 Billion Market Plagued With ProblemsCan AI Beat the Market?

Craig Torres,"Jefferson Says Fed Can Proceed Carefully, Mindful of Yield Rise","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said he is watching the increase in Treasury yields as a potential further restraint on the economy even though the rate of inflation remains too high.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingA Fractured Israel Unites Around a Singular Goal: Crush the EnemyXi’s Reply to Hamas Attack Shows China’s Limit as PeacemakerBank of America’s Wrong-Way Rate Bet Hurts Moynihan’s Growth PledgeOfficials are “in a position to proceed carefully in assessing the extent of any additional policy firming that may be necessary,” Jefferson said Monday in a speech at a National Association for Business Economics conference in Dallas.“Looking ahead, I will remain cognizant of the tightening in financial conditions through higher bond yields and will keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy.”After raising the benchmark federal funds rate by more than five percentage points over the past year and a half, a majority of US central bankers at their September policy meeting projected it would be appropriate to enact one more quarter-point increase by the end of 2023.Yields on US government 10-year notes are up about 40 basis points since the September meeting. Fed officials including San Francisco’s Mary Daly and Lorie Logan of Dallas noted the recent tightening of financial conditions may substitute for additional rate hikes.“We are in a sensitive period of risk management, where we have to balance the risk of not having tightened enough, against the risk of policy being too restrictive,” Jefferson said.Futures markets show less than 20% chance of a 25 basis-point increase at the upcoming Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, and similar odds on a hike at the final meeting of the year in December.Answering questions after his speech, the vice chair said he wouldn’t want to prejudge how the Fed would respond to economic developments.Story continues“Our responsibility is to bring inflation down to 2% and to be nimble with regards to what may or may not be happening in the economy as we go forward,” Jefferson said. “I would want the public to know that we’re going to be mindful, whatever is happening, and we will use data in real time to pick an appropriate response.”In spite of rising borrowing costs, the US economy has shown surprising resilience. The labor market added 336,000 jobs in September, according to fresh data published Friday.Jefferson in his speech listed risks on both sides of the outlook, from the potential impact of slower growth in China and Europe on the US to a labor market that might remain “too strong to achieve further disinflation.”--With assistance from Edward Dufner.(Updates with additional comments from Jefferson beginning in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraA Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Native Art Is a $1.5 Billion Market Plagued With ProblemsCan AI Beat the Market?

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,2 Federal Reserve officials say spike in bond yields may allow central bank to leave rates alone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Monday that the central bank may leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting in three weeks because a surge in long-term interest rates has made borrowing more expensive and could help cool inflation without further action by the Fed.Since late July, the yield, or rate, on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has jumped from around 4% to about 4.8%, a 16-year high. The run-up in the yield has inflated other borrowing costs and raised the national average 30-year mortgage rate to 7.5%, according to Freddie Mac, a 23-year high. Business borrowing costs have also risen as corporate bond yields have accelerated.Philip Jefferson, vice chair of the Fed's board and a close ally of Chair Jerome Powell, said in a speech Monday to the National Association for Business Economics that he would “remain cognizant” of the higher bond rates and “keep that in mind as I assess the future path of policy.”U.S. stock prices reversed their losses after Jefferson's comments. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% in late trading.Jefferson's comments followed a speech to the NABE earlier in the day by Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee. She also indicated that higher long-term bond rates could help serve the central bank's efforts to slow inflation to its 2% target.Since March of last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark short-term rate 11 times, from near zero to roughly 5.4%. The rate hikes have been intended to defeat the worst bout of inflation in more than 40 years. But they have also led to much higher borrowing rates and sparked worries that they could trigger a recession.“If long-term interest rates remain elevated"" because investors are increasingly concerned about the risks of holding long-term bonds, ""there may be less need to raise the fed funds rate,” Logan said, referring to the Fed's benchmark rate. Bond rates rise when investors find them riskier to buy or hold.Story continuesAnd last Thursday, Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that if longer-term interest rates remain high, “the need for us to take further action is diminished.”The Fed officials' remarks coincide with increasing expectations in financial markets that the Fed will skip rate hikes at its meeting Nov. 1, as well as at the following meeting Dec. 13, and simply leave its benchmark rate at its current high level through the end of this year. Futures markets have priced in only a 12% chance of a rate hike in November and 26% in December, both significantly lower than on Friday, when a surprisingly robust jobs report was released.Fed officials have not pushed back against those expectations in their remarks, a sign they may not disagree with them at the moment.“There’s this growing sense of comfort among Fed officials with the July rate hike having been the last one in this tightening cycle and now focusing on how long to keep monetary policy at the current restrictive level,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, the accounting and consulting firm.One issue that economists and Fed officials are trying to determine is what factors are pushing longer-term rates higher. The Fed's rate hikes themselves don't automatically translate into higher longer-run borrowing costs, such as the 10-year Treasury yield. Market forces, expectations for future inflation and for future economic growth also affect yields.Logan noted that if longer-term rates are rising mostly because investors expect the economy to grow more quickly in the future, the Fed might have to keep lifting their short-term rate to cool the economy. But analysts increasingly think that the 10-year rate is rising because investors see greater volatility in inflation and the economy and consider holding longer-term bonds to be more risky. In that case, the Fed doesn't necessarily have to do more to cool the economy.Another issue bedeviling Fed officials is how long it may take from the time they hike short-term rates until those higher rates impact the economy. The economist Milton Friedman said in the 1960s that the Fed's policies work with “long and variable lags,” and yet now Fed officials disagree with how long they are.Logan, like Fed governor Christopher Waller, said she thinks much of the impact of the Fed's rate increases have already occurred, as businesses have reacted quickly because Powell and other Fed officials issued clear warnings that rates were likely to rise quickly.But Jefferson noted the large amount of corporate debt that was refinanced at very low interest rates during the pandemic, and said that businesses would have to refinance it in coming years at higher rates, potentially slowing growth.Jefferson said that when thinking about future interest rate decisions, he would have to keep in mind all the rate hikes the Fed has imposed, that have yet to hit the economy, “and that could influence what I think should happen next.”"
Alex Longley and Devika Krishna Kumar,Middle East Conflict Spurs Bullish Rush in Oil Options Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Bullish oil options contracts surged in value as the conflict between Israel and Hamas injected a fresh dose of volatility into a market that already had seen huge swings over the last week.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingA Fractured Israel Unites Around a Singular Goal: Crush the EnemyBank of America’s Wrong-Way Rate Bet Hurts Moynihan’s Growth PledgeIsrael Latest: Over 1,100 Dead; US Sends Warships to RegionCall options, which profit from higher prices, surged relative to bearish put contracts for the Brent global crude benchmark on Monday. The difference between the two, known as the skew, was on track for its biggest one-day move since March 2022, when oil prices rocketed in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Oil prices in New York surged as much as 5.4% on Monday as the conflict threatened political stability in the wider Middle East — the latest sharp swing in an oil market that has seen a tumultuous few weeks. Late last month, prices looked set to rally to $100 a barrel, before an ensuing sharp slump, driven by financial flows and demand concerns, saw them shed about $10 over a week.The tumble led to a surge in options volatility last week as traders who had positioned for higher prices rushed to cover themselves when oil fell. That had caused the skew to surge in favor of puts, but the move reversed Monday.The price shift also showed up in volumes, with call trading outpacing that of puts significantly on Monday. About 154,000 Brent calls traded by 11:27am in New York, compared with 52,000 put options. Among the most actively traded contracts were calls for $100- and $110-a-barrel oil for December.--With assistance from John Deane.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraA Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaNative Art Is a $1.5 Billion Market Plagued With ProblemsCan AI Beat the Market?

Logan said “there is a clear role for increased term premiums in recent yield curve moves,” though “the size and persistence of the contribution are subject to uncertainty.”Read More: How Rising Rates, US Debt Brought Back Term Premiums: QuickTakeOn the other hand, “to the extent that strength in the economy is behind the increase in long-term interest rates,” the central bank may need to tighten more, Logan said.Fed officials are trying to decide whether they need to hike their benchmark federal funds rate again this year after raising it by more than five percentage points over the last 19 months. The yield on 30-year Treasury securities rose above 5% last week, the highest since 2007, amid an ongoing adjustment in markets to the Fed’s message that rates are likely to remain higher for longer than previously thought.Better BalanceSpeaking separately at an American Bankers Association event Monday, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr downplayed results of a monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report published Oct 6, which showed stronger-than expected employment growth in September.Story continues“There are important elements of the labor market that are showing that labor supply and labor demand are coming into better balance,” Barr said, citing cooler wage growth. “The picture is one that is showing that we have made significant progress on bringing inflation towards the direction we want.”Answering questions after her speech, Logan argued “we have more work to do, and I think restrictive financial conditions will be will be needed for some time.”“The most important thing is that we stay focused on on restoring price stability, and I think that will require some rebalancing in the labor market,” she said.Investors currently see less-than-even odds of another rate increase this year, according to futures. Logan’s comments Monday jibed with recent remarks from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who suggested on Oct. 5 that “if financial conditions, which have tightened considerably in the past 90 days, remain tight, the need for us to take further action is diminished.”(Updates with Barr’s comments in seventh paragraph.

Alaric Nightingale,What Oil Traders Are Watching After Shock Attack on Israel,"(Bloomberg) -- The shock attack by Hamas and Israel’s response risk a wider destabilization of the region — and the global oil market is watching.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingIsrael Latest: Over 1,100 Dead; US Sends Warships to RegionBank of America’s Wrong-Way Rate Bet Hurts Moynihan’s Growth PledgeStocks Shrug Off Losses After Fedspeak; Oil Climbs: Markets WrapThere are sprawling questions about the geopolitical consequences of the conflict, which erupted 50 years after the Yom Kippur war that foreshadowed the 1970s oil crisis.There is no suggestion that the fallout from the current situation will be comparable to what happened back then, but it could alter the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East in unpredictable ways. Israel has broadly pointed the finger at Iran following the attack. Tehran has denied involvement but President Ebrahim Raisi called it a “victory.”Before the weekend, Saudi Arabia had been close to a deal with Israel that could have brought increased stability to the region. The US and Iran were engaged in broad but largely unacknowledged efforts to reach a kind of detente, and with it higher oil flows.Many of the geopolitical considerations will hinge on how far Israel takes its response — particularly with regard to Iran. For now, these are the most immediate considerations for oil traders:1. Sanctions EnforcementThere is a widely held belief in the oil market that the US has turned something of a blind eye to sanctions on Iran’s oil flows, allowing shipments to soar in recent months.That has helped keep a lid on oil prices in a market that has seen a huge loss of supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of OPEC+.There is a chance that the US could take aim at this trade. The Islamic Republic currently sells the bulk of its crude exports to China, sending 1.5 million barrels a day — the most in a decade — in August, according to data intelligence firm Kpler.Story continuesIt’s hard to be sure how much control the US can really exert. Since Iranian sanctions were re-imposed in 2018, sales to Chinese customers have increasingly been transacted in yuan, or via barter trade, and executed by local banks to circumvent western restrictions. Oil is transported on Iran’s own tankers or so-called dark fleet vessels, using a supply chain that US authorities can’t easily control.Any outcome that cuts Iran’s oil flow could boost demand for Russia’s barrels — an undesirable outcome for Washington or other Group of Seven nations trying to cut Moscow’s access to petrodollars.What’s more, any move to clamp down would tighten the oil market, a big decision to take going into an election year in the US.2. Hormuz DisturbanceThe Strait of Hormuz connects oil producing countries in the Persian Gulf to refineries all over the world.It is a transit point for one in every six barrels that the world consumes, and a stretch of water over which Iran has often claimed dominion. It’s vital to the global energy market.For now, there’s no sign Tehran is moving to disrupt merchant shipping — something it has done in recent times, often in tit-for-tat measures.Hormuz has never truly halted. Not in the Tanker War of 1984 in which Iran and Iraq would routinely attack each other’s oil carriers, and not in more recent times when Tehran stepped up vessel seizures and harassment of merchant shipping.Halting Hormuz hurts Iran’s allies. That doesn’t mean it can’t be significantly disrupted — even to the point of disrupting the flow of oil — bit it’s hard to see it being fully stopped.Beyond the strait, there have also been instances in recent years where Iran’s own oil shipments have been intercepted and disrupted by western powers — another source of potential disruption in an escalation.3. How Wide?The readout from the conflict for the oil market rests very much on what Israel does in the coming days, weeks and months.What Oil Watchers Have to Say About Impact of Hamas’ AttacksIran is a “very big wild card” and there will a focus on how strongly Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blames Tehran for facilitating the attacks, RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts including Helima Croft said in a note.4. Strategic ReleasesIf the conflict ultimately spirals into something that affects oil supply, or boosts oil prices for a prolonged period, it would be a justification for the US government to further sell barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.That could quell short-term oil price moves, but it would nevertheless leave the US needing to replenish its stockpile at some point in the future.5. History as a GuideFor all of these risks, there is nevertheless a chance that this war ultimately proves to be immaterial for the oil market.Turmoil in the region in recent times hasn’t been a catalyst for structural moves higher in oil prices. Traders want proof that the disturbances are material for supply. And usually, they aren’t.--With assistance from Julian Lee and Serene Cheong.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraCan AI Beat the Market?

A “blowout” jobs report last week raised the likelihood the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again, further constraining net interest income growth and highlighting the need to lower business costs.Quarterly reports from PepsiCo Inc., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Domino’s Pizza Inc. will underscore the dwindling spending power of American consumers, who now hold less cash in hand than they did before the pandemic.Monday: No earnings of note.Tuesday: Pepsi (PEP US) earnings are seen rising 9.4%, slowing after two quarters of double-digit gains. Concerns that cost-conscious customers will switch to cheaper brands may be overstated, Goldman Sachs said, noting that PepsiCo enjoys a “favorable geographic footprint” over rivals. However, BI said unfavorable foreign-exchange rates likely crimped quarterly revenue growth. Pepsi, which has the capacity to take on $10 billion of debt without hurting its credit profile, could be looking to further grow its portfolio of snack brands; the company had shown interest in buying Hostess Brands, which was eventually sold to J.M. Smucker.Wednesday: No earnings of note.Thursday: Walgreens Boots’ (WBA US) adjusted earnings per share likely shrank 14% in the quarter, with Jefferies analysts expecting continued pressure on the profitability of its US retail pharmacy segment, the company’s largest money maker. Operational issues with VillageMD, a clinic operator in which Walgreens has a controlling stake, also likely weighed on performance. Analysts are calling Walgreen’s 2024 and 2025 guidance into question amid the drugstore chain’s recent C-suite shakeout.Story continuesDelta Air Lines (DAL US) has seen estimates for its third-quarter adjusted earnings revised downwards as higher fuel and labor costs bite. The carrier’s four-year contract with its pilots, signed in March, will further erode margins at a time when slowing domestic demand is also squeezing passenger yield, BI said.Domino’s Pizza’s (DPZ US) domestic same-store sales growth was flat in the quarter from a year ago, dragged down by fewer delivery orders, BI said. A revamped loyalty program and a new partnership with Uber Eats could help in the fourth quarter, though the worsening global consumer environment will continue to weigh on earnings, Barclays said.Friday: JPMorgan (JPM US) is set to post the fastest earnings-per-share growth among major US investment banks this reporting season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net interest income likely jumped 27% in the period, offsetting declines in trading revenues and investment-banking fees. The bank could beat its full-year NII guidance, defying the impact of persistently higher interest rates, said Piper Sandler. JPMorgan’s third-quarter report is due pre-market.Citigroup (C US) earnings likely fell 18%, while Wells Fargo’s (WFC US) are projected to decline 3.6%. Expenses and efficiencies will be under increased scrutiny in both reports, which are due before the opening bell. Rising operating costs are outpacing Citi’s revenue growth and weighing on profitability, even as the bank prepares to overhaul its organizational structure, BI said. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has reiterated its full-year expense outlook but also has opportunities for more efficiencies, Piper Sandler said.PNC Financial Services (PNC US) could say more about this month’s purchase of a $17 billion portfolio of capital-commitment facilities from Signature Bank, on its third-quarter earnings call. The deal should add around 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter without materially impacting PNC’s capital ratios, RBC Capital Markets said. Earnings and revenue likely shrank in the third quarter, with net interest margin down for the first time after six straight quarters of growth.BlackRock’s (BLK US) adjusted earnings are projected to fall 11% from a year ago, as the firm faces challenges from slowing institutional flows and foreign-currency headwinds, Citi analysts said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraCan AI Beat the Market?

Josh Schafer,A key inflation gauge and bank earnings: What to know this week,"A crucial inflation print and the start of third quarter earnings season are set to greet investors in the week ahead.The economic highlight will come on Thursday morning, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September will be released. The report is expected to show a small decrease in headline inflation.Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting are also expected to provide further insight on the path forward for monetary policy and a reading of consumer sentiment will close out the week.On the corporate side, Pepsi (PEP), Delta (DAL), and JPMorgan (JPM) will highlight the start of third quarter earnings season. Reports from Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BlackRock (BLK) are expected on Friday.Monday is a bond market holiday, meaning there will be no bids on Treasury yields, which have been at the top of investor focus over the past week. However, the US stock market will still be open.Stocks enter the week largely higher after a blowout September jobs report sent stocks roaring on Friday, negating a bond yield-driven sell-off earlier in the week. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) climbed nearly 1.6% while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.5%. Both rises marked the best week in the past five for the indexes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.3%.A hot September jobs report has further complicated the Fed's next move.The details of the report could have positives for the Fed. On a month-over-month basis, hourly wage growth came in cooler than the expected at 0.2% for the second straight month. The yearly wage growth of 4.2% was the slowest annual pace since June 2021.Broadly though, the 334,000 nonfarm payroll additions was unavoidably hot compared to what economists had expected. And that adds upside risks to further rate hikes, according to economists, as the hot job market needs to be met with cooling inflation in order to stay on pace for a coveted ""soft landing.""""While we’re sticking with our call for rates on hold, if today’s number is followed by hot inflation data the Fed may get pulled into another hike,"" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note on Friday. ""And if that happens the already-tenuous case for avoiding recession next year gets harder to make.""Story continues<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13015579/embed?auto=1></iframe>The latest inflation print is expected on Thursday via the Consumer Price Index. Economists forecast prices rose 3.6% over the prior year in September, a decrease from headline inflation of 3.7% in August. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a monthly basis, down from a 0.6% in August.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, CPI is expected to have risen 4.1% over last year in September, a slowdown from the 4.3% increase seen in August. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, equal from the monthly increase seen in August.""We think there is a greater risk of core CPI printing at 0.3% m/m than 0.1% m/m,"" Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""Airfares and lodging could come in firmer than we expect, which would push up the m/m print to 0.3%, all else equal ... Should the print come in as we expect or above our expectations, it would keep a November hike in play.""Bets on the Fed hiking interest rates at the November meeting increased after the September jobs reports release. As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 27% chance of a rate hike in November, up from 18% a week prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool.<img alt=""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023, in Washington.

Strategists believe bank stocks could provide key insight into how corporate America is dealing with the higher interest rate environment.""[Bank stocks] need to participate in any recovery rally in order to validate the notion that higher interest rates do not doom the US economy to a recession next year. If you are very bullish here, this is the group for you,"" DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.Pepsi and Delta will provide a look at consumer demand. Pepsi will be one of the first consumer brands to report since reports about weight loss drugs bringing down demand for snacks sank stocks in the sector last week.Leading into Friday's jobs report, bond yields rose to 16-year highs. The rising yields unsettled investors already fearful of the impact of further rate hikes and sent stocks lower. But the bond-induced sell-off might not have been all bad.For one, it could keep the Fed on pause in November as some economists and Fed officials believe the rise in bonds might've already done the credit-tightening work for the central bank.""Were it not for the significant tightening in financial conditions (more than two 25bp hikes in fed funds equivalent), this report might support the additional hike foreseen in the Fed's September projections,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote in a note on Friday.And while the tightening itself could still be a concern for investors, it might have opened up markets for a new catalyst.Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel says the past week's ""bondfire of the volatilities"" provided a buying opportunity for stocks.""As much focus as there is on Yields right now, earnings season begins in a week and the flip side of unanticipated 3Q economic strength is that 3Q earnings will likely surprise to the upside,"" Emanuel wrote in a note on Friday.

Alicia Adamczyk,Financial experts say we need to stop living in a ‘YOLO economy.’ They share 5 ways to rein in spending,"This summer, I saw many of my favorite artists in concert, took trips I'll not soon forget, and started upgrading my wardrobe for the return to office. It was gratifying to be back in community with other fans, to be part of cultural moments that were few and far between in recent years, and to spend time out in the world with the people I love.It was also, well, expensive. I don't regret the money I paid, but as the weather starts to cool off here in New York (or at least hints at cooling off), it feels like the right time to recalibrate my budget and dial back my spending as well.I'm likely not the only one who feels this way. Consumer spending has been strong over the past few years, with retail, travel, and experience spending particularly robust. Despite the Federal Reserve's best efforts, Americans spent 5.8% more in August 2023 than they did last year.Though Americans haven't been under stay-at-home orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic in years, there is still a pervading sense that we're catching up on things we missed—or that tomorrow isn't guaranteed, so you might as well spend today, says Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.""We’re in a YOLO economy,"" says Samana, referring to the acronym for ""you only live once."" ""We should be in an intermittent fasting economy to save up for the recession.""This fall is a great time to check in on your finances even if you haven't been overspending. For almost 44 million, October brings the first additional multi-hundred dollar bill each month, as federal student loans are due again. Credit card debt has surpassed $1 trillion, a record high. And gas prices have been soaring.Interest rates have also been creeping up, as the Fed tries to rein in inflation, partially caused by all that spending. A recession hasn't materialized, but if you're anything like me, you're always a little worried it could, leading to job loss or general anxiety.Story continuesWith all of those macro—and personal—headwinds at play, here's what financial advisors suggest to work on for your financial peace of mind.Reassess your budgetLook, no one likes to hear it, but actually understanding where your money is going is crucial to getting a handle on it. With the price of just about everything on a seemingly neverending upward spiral, it's important to take stock of what you're paying and to whom.For example: You probably know what subscriptions you pay for, but do you know how much you're paying? Many have increased costs recently. If you're going to the office more and use public transportation, is it time to opt back into your company's commuter benefits program?""Take a close look at your checking and credit card accounts and examine every purchase, charge, and expense to determine what was a necessary purchase and where you may have overspent on something unnecessary, your 'needs' versus your 'wants,'"" says Mary Hines Droesch, head of consumer and small business products at Bank of America. ""This can help you determine some areas where you may be able to cut back your spending in the 'wants' category as you reevaluate your habits and priorities.""There are a number of programs you can use to track your household's spending. Software like Mint and You Need a Budget are particularly popular, and there are online communities you can join to get more insight into them.Create an ""honest list"" of your assets, debts, and upcoming large expenses, suggests Kelly Palmer, founder and chief wealth officer of The Wealthy Parent, a financial planning firm in Chicago. ""If you are in a relationship, this is a hugely important step to take with your partner,"" Palmer says. ""Fall is a great time to reconnect with your partner financially before the stress of the holidays sets in.""Personally, I track my savings and investments in a Google spreadsheet; I'll be adding on my daily spending this month to get a fuller picture. I also get text alerts of all of my credit card swipes and daily updates with my balances, which you can do by logging into your account on your bank or credit card company's website.Prioritize certain spendingWhen I've strayed from my financial goals, I like to reset with a No Spend month. During these periods, I cut out on non-essential purchases or follow other pre-determined rules I've made.""While it may seem like a drastic step, think of it as the equivalent of putting your spending on an elimination diet to see what you can truly live without,"" says Hines Droesch.A No Spend month can be helpful because it's a temporary reset. But reassessing your budget doesn't mean cutting back on all discretionary spending long term. In fact, doing so can often backfire.""Give yourself permission to spend a little on 'fun stuff,'"" says Hines Droesch. ""Applying the 50/30/20 method to any budget is a universal way of ensuring the proper amounts of your income is going to saving and investing while leaving enough room to enjoy your hard-earned money.""The 50/30/20 budget is a popular method of divvying up expenses. Following it, 50% of your after-tax income goes toward needs, like your housing payment, student loans, groceries, etc. Another 30% goes toward wants, and 20% goes toward savings (including investments).""By living below your means, you’ll lay the groundwork for a lifetime of financial progress,"" says Hines Droesch. ""When you treat savings as mandatory, you make it that much easier to stay serious about achieving financial stability.""Pay down credit card debtThough student loan debt has gotten a lot of attention lately, credit card debt is often a bigger headache for the consumers who have it. The interest rate is likely to be higher, and it can be more predatory. That's why if you've accrued some, it's critical to focus on paying that down ASAP, says Andrea Woroch, a family-budgeting expert.That's doubly true in the current environment because not only has consumer credit card debt hit a record high, but so have interest rates: The average credit card APR in September hit 24.45%, according to LendingTree, with 35% of cards charging as high as 29.99%.Of course, many of these steps are easier said than done. What's helped me focus on these types of goals is finding others in a similar boat. There are Facebook groups and subreddits related to personal finance that can inspire you to stick to your budget, and TikTokers (like Jamie Feldman, whom I profiled here) chronicling their debt payoff journeys. If you're only watching content that encourages you to spend, or talks about how pointless or difficult saving is, it's hard to make changes. But seeing or reading about others do it can be the encouragement you need.If you qualify, look into a 0% balance transfer. With these offers, a credit card company allows you to use a new card to pay off a credit card balance you have with another company, often with a 0% interest rate for a set amount of months. So if you have 0% for 24 months, you have two years to pay down your balance without more interest accruing. That can help you become debt free, or at least make substantial inroads.Think long termAs a millennial with a propensity to doom scroll, it can often feel silly to prioritize saving and investing when the future is so uncertain. That's a popular sentiment among younger generations: 45% of workers aged 18 to 35 don’t see the point of saving for retirement ""until things return to normal,"" a 2022 report from Fidelity found.I won't pretend to know what the future holds. But one thing that's helped me is the realization that no matter what happens, there likely won't come a time when I wish I had less money saved.One thirty-something put it to me as saving in a ""nihilism fund."" Focusing on what you can control in an uncertain world can be empowering.Get helpIf you're struggling to make your budget work, there are ways to ask for help.For example, if you have federal student loans, an income-driven repayment plan may help lower your monthly payment. The new SAVE plan is particularly generous. You can apply on the Department of Education's website.If credit card debt is stressing you out, you might be able to negotiate your interest rate, consolidate your debt, or get on a payment plan. Set aside an afternoon to call your credit card company to see how they can help you.""If you’re struggling, communicate with creditors and work with them on paying down your debt,"" says Brandon Robinson, president and founder of Texas-based financial firm JBR Associates. ""Many are willing to be flexible.""Another option is to work with a credit counseling company, which can give you advice and help you develop a budget and repayment plan. Just remember: Most reputable credit counseling organizations are nonprofits—check with your local credit union or even a university to find one that won't overcharge you.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
The Economist,A jobs bonanza stirs fears the American economy is overheating,"The american economy is supposed to be slowing down by now, and that is supposed to be translating into a weaker labour market. But according to figures released on October 6th, the country added 336,000 jobs in September, nearly twice as many as forecast and the most since January (see chart). It is the latest evidence that, despite an aggressive series of interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve over the past 18 months, American growth remains resilient. Instead of the “hard-landing” forecasts that predicted a recession, and were so common earlier this year, America looks to be heading for something more like a “no-landing” scenario.<img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DkGzwyuSRjvzmG3yZJ33fg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTExMDc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_economist_group_401/39677f890524867ba2097ee59e5cec70 class=caas-img>Underlying the data release is a vexing question, about whether the labour-market resilience is excessive, and will therefore place upward pressure on inflation. If so, Fed policymakers will be tempted to resume their interest-rate rises before long. In recent weeks financial markets have moved sharply to price in the possibility that rates will remain elevated for an extended period—or, to use the terminology now favoured, stay “higher for longer”—owing to the Fed’s protracted fight against inflation. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds have soared since August to around 4.8%, their highest in more than 15 years, which represents a swift tightening of financial conditions.Initial reactions to the strong jobs data fell into the good-news-is-bad-news mould. In the minutes after the release, yields on Treasuries jumped yet higher, reflecting bets that the Fed may raise rates again as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for the end of this month. That, in turn, weighed on stockmarkets globally.However, as analysts and investors digested the numbers, worries about the outlook for rates gave way to optimism about the broader economy, because the employment report also offered pretty positive signals about inflation. Average hourly earnings—a proxy for wage growth—were up 0.2% month-on-month in September, the slowest monthly rise since early 2022. In year-on-year terms, earnings growth of 4.2% dipped to its weakest since mid-2021. Alongside a recent deceleration in inflation, an ebbing of wage pressures will reassure the Fed that prices are trending in the desired direction.Story continuesA separate batch of labour-market data published at the same time—based on a survey of households rather than businesses—also painted a more restrained picture. It showed that just 86,000 jobs were added last month. With 90,000 people entering the workforce at the same time, the unemployment rate remained perfectly steady at 3.8%, which is low by historical standards but a touch higher than a few months ago. All this suggests that the labour market has gone from being ultra-tight to just moderately tight. Viewed in such a light, America’s economic resilience would appear to be impressive, not excessive.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

Josh Schafer,September jobs report shows US economy remains stronger than Wall Street thinks,"A monthly jobs report just blew out expectations, and the US economy remains in a familiar position. In September, 334,000 nonfarm payrolls were added to the labor market, nearly double the consensus estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg and the highest monthly addition since January.The odds of a Fed rate hike, as measured by investor bets on the CME FedWatch Tool, ticked higher to a 30% chance the central bank boosts rates in November, up from a 18% chance last week.And some Wall Street economists think Friday's report was one of the last signs of strength before the Fed's historically fast tightening cycle finally grabs hold of the elusive US consumer.""Despite all the excitement around the September report, we don’t exclude the possibility of a negative payroll print before year-end,"" EY chief economist Greg Daco wrote in a research note on Friday.Daco cited the United Auto Workers strike, ""easing consumer spending,"" and more ""cautious business activity"" as factors that will slow labor demand in the months ahead. The firm boosted its odds for a recession in the next 12 months to 50% from 40%.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13015579/embed?auto=1></iframe>But the fact is, the current situation isn't nearly as bad as many thought it would be, and the fears of a slowdown are just projections for now. Just as they were in July when economists shunned the highest consumer confidence in two years. Or when March's decline in retail sales amid a banking crisis proved to be an aberration not a trend as consumers have kept spending. And spending.While there have been hints of cooling, recent data still reflects a resilient economy that remains resilient, with flashes of cooling. The final reading of Gross Domestic Product for the second quarter showed the economy grew at a 2.1% pace. Expectations are for 4.9% growth in the current quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow Forecaster. And a recent revision from the government showed households' ""excess savings"" have been higher than previously thought and therefore could promote more consumer spending.Story continues""A year ago there was a general consensus among economists and financial markets that a recession was in the offing,"" Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note on Thursday. ""Those forecasts have largely been pared, put-off or canceled altogether. To some extent the rationale for these more sanguine assessments is a recognition of the uncanny staying power of the consumer.""Quinlan and Wells Fargo noted that their predicted slowdown in the labor market would be the catalyst that eventually slows down the consumer. But as of Friday's data that's not happening. And it's not just the monthly jobs report, either. The August Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed job openings hit their highest levels since May. Meanwhile jobless claims remain muted, which economists have highlighted reflects a low layoff environment.<img alt=""A sign hangs in front of U.S. flags outside of the New York Stock Exchange in New York September 1, 2015.

Myles Udland,One thing stands between the US labor market and a full recovery from the pandemic,"Back in August 2022, the number of people employed in the US officially overtook pre-pandemic highs reached in February 2020.But the headline recovery in the labor market papered over weakness that remained in the industries hardest hit by the pandemic. Namely, restaurants and hotels.The September jobs report showed employment in the accommodations industry — which covers hotels — remains the last major holdout in restoring the labor market to its pre-pandemic status.In September, employment in the food services and drinking places industry rose by 61,000, returning this industry to its February 2020 level. As of September, 12,368,400 people worked in this industry; in February 2020, 12,338,900 people were employed in this line of work.Accommodations employment, in contrast, stood 10.3% below levels that prevailed just before the pandemic. Last month, the industry added 16,000 workers, bringing the employment total for this industry to 1,895,500; in February 2020, there were 2,054,500 people employed in this industry.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15265636/embed?auto=1></iframe>And this weakness in accommodations employment accounts for more than all of the gap in leisure and hospitality, the only major industry tracked by the BLS that has not recovered its pandemic-induced losses.As of September, leisure and hospitality employment was just 184,000 jobs short of February 2020 levels. Accommodation and food services — a sub-industry within leisure and hospitality — employment was 187,500 jobs shy of these levels. And as we saw above, that gap is solely attributable to the shortfall in accommodations.Overall, the US labor market added 336,000 new jobs in September, nearly double the 170,000 that were forecast by Wall Street. This report served as the latest sign the economy remains more resilient than expected by many economists.""The labor market remains robust,"" wrote Bank of America economist Stephen Juneau in a client note on Friday.Juneau also noted that hiring in ""high-touch services sectors [like] education and health, leisure and hospitality, and other services"" accounts for 55% of the job gains we've seen this year. ""In short, the sectors that lagged behind the broader labor market recovery continue to hire at a rapid clip.""Story continuesAnd that we're slicing the industry data on employment this finely to find the remaining cracks in the labor market speaks to the strength of this recovery and the encouraging dearth of residual damage lingering from the pandemic.<img alt=""Concierge Maurice stands behind a plexiglass barrier at The Pierre, A Taj Hotel, New York on September 28, 2020 in New York City. - John Farrell and his wife booked a $1,000 room in the morning and were in New York hours later for their one-night stay.

(Chris Pizzello/AP Photo)MoreStriking Hollywood actors will meet with studios again on Friday as the two sides restart negotiations on the heels of an epic conclusion to the writers strike last week.SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — began a strike on July 14 after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the major studios including Warner Bros. (WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Sony (SONY).Similarly to the writers, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to better pay, improved working conditions, and higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go directly to streaming.The writers union, Writers Guild of America (WGA), had been on strike for nearly 150 days prior to its studio deal. The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.Industry watchers largely expect SAG-AFTRA to reach a similar conclusion, although the union made it clear that, while it will review the WGA's agreement, the guild is ultimately committed to reaching a deal that's specific to its member base.Story continues<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13015579/embed?auto=1></iframe>According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 writers strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion.

Hamza Shaban,How the Fed's 'higher for longer' rate hikes will squeeze the US government,"Even small moves in interest rates can have big impacts on deficits.That's why the surge in bond yields has fueled concerns over the Federal Reserve and government debt, and what deficit watchers see as a looming crisis spelled out in budget lines.Earlier this week the yield on 10-year Treasuries (^TNX) surpassed levels not seen in more than 15 years, rising just above 4.8%. While yields fell slightly on Thursday, they remain elevated, holding over 4.5% for nearly two weeks. Their climb accelerated in recent weeks after the Fed signaled it would raise rates once more before the end of the year. Investors are also grappling with signs that the central bank will keep rates higher for longer as the Fed struggles to yank inflation down to its 2% target.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/story/1831701/embed?auto=1></iframe>The rapid ascent of bond yields — leaping more than 50 basis points in a month — has grabbed the attention of deficit watchers because of the outsized impact interest rates have on the federal budget.Interest on government debt is on track to cost $10 trillion over the next decade, according to estimates. In the fiscal year of 2022, American taxpayers spent $475 billion in interest on the national debt. The following year that figure climbed to $640 billion. And as a percentage of GDP, the costs of servicing the debt is projected to rise from 2.4% in 2023 to 3.6% 2033.While deficit spending can serve as an effective economic strategy, especially to stimulate the economy during a downturn, some experts say higher government debt loads can crowd out other types of spending, causing interest rates to rise, which can have a corrosive effect on economic growth.The Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this year that if all interest rates — including those on three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury notes — were 0.1 percentage point higher each year than they are in its forecast, deficits would increase progressively over the next 10 years by amounts that would reach $47 billion in 2033. The cumulative deficit from 2024 to 2033 would increase by $303 billion.Story continuesAnd while interest rates are not excessively high by historical standards, the prior period when rates approached 5% coincided with far less government debt as a percent of GDP, so the debt load was easier to manage.The last time the US had interest rates and Treasury yields this high the debt-to-GDP ratio was a third of the size, said Andrew Lautz, a senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank that updates a monthly deficit tracker. ""So our debt situation is almost three times ... worse. That is going to make it massively more expensive to handle the current debt burden and significantly increase the cost we pay for it.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13727016/embed?auto=1></iframe>Even if the Fed’s next rate hike is the last of the cycle, as forecasts suggest, the costs of paying down government debt will keep increasing, as Washington's new borrowing comes at higher interest rates.Government estimates of future interest payments paint an onerous picture that experts say could spell an unworkable budget. In 10 years, interest payments are projected to exceed $1.4 trillion annually. That's more than defense spending is expected to cost in that period.“At some point in the future, if we don’t change something, then it’s unsustainable. It just won’t work,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.Interest rates are not astronomically high right now, Zandi said, but what's striking is that rates were previously so low. And in the current economic climate, with GDP growth expected to slow, its unlikely that the US economy can expand its way out of the situation, he said. That puts the onus on the federal government to rethink taxing and spending.<img alt=""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference in Washington, D.C., the United States, Sep. 20, 2023.

(Aaron Schwartz/Xinhua via Getty Images)Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington think tank, pointed to an array of policies to combat Washington's fiscal challenges, including tax reform, raising the retirement age, and changes to immigration policy. ""We can't grow our way out of this but growth can help us get out of this,"" he said.Emergency borrowing during the initial, chaotic phase of the COVID public health crisis came cheap for the government. The Fed kicked into rescue mode and lowered interest rates to avoid a depression. Inflation wasn't an issue then either. But Goldwein noted that while such investments may have seemed cheap at the time, there wasn't a plan to pay for the borrowed money. That means the government's low-interest debt is rolling over into high-interest debt, in addition to Washington taking on altogether new debt, he said.The CRFB estimates that nearly 60% of government debt originated when the average interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes was less than 3%. And more than half of all debt will mature in the next three years.Regarding that low-cost borrowing as a free pass was ""a huge error that we are paying for,"" Goldwein said.Even as some budgetary hawks sound the alarm, other observers don't see a catastrophe waiting to happen. Nathan Tankus, the research director of the Modern Money Network, a nonprofit that runs educational programs about money and economics, said that dire projections of astronomical interest expenses don't account for the ways those government payments will influence GDP. And if the forecasts are as stark and disastrous as hawks say they are, he said, the budgetary calamity would force the Fed to act, since price stability would come under threat.Tankus, who is writing a book about the Federal Reserve, also points out that concerns over growing debt payments tied to rising interest rates is a reason to rethink the Fed's limited and in some ways crude toolbox for combating inflation.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER,Rising long-term interest rates are posing the latest threat to a US economic 'soft landing',"WASHINGTON (AP) — Surging interest rates are intensifying the challenges for the U.S. economy and threatening to derail the Federal Reserve’s drive to tame inflation without causing a deep recession.Since mid-summer, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for many loans, has steadily climbed, causing a spillover rise in other borrowing costs. The costs of mortgages, auto loans and credit card debt have all risen in response. The collective impact of higher rates across the economy could also weaken the government's own finances.The jump in longer-term rates coincides with other threats, from higher gas prices and this week's resumption of student loan payments to autoworkers’ ongoing strike and the risk of a government shutdown next month, all of which could leave consumers with less money to spend to power the economy.The strike by the United Auto Workers, now in its third week with no resolution in sight, could reduce vehicle sales in coming months. And the threat of a government shutdown, narrowly averted this past weekend, looms large, especially given the chaos over the leadership of the House of Representatives. Far-right Republican House members deposed their leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, on Tuesday for working with Democrats to temporarily avoid a shutdown.The economy is coming off a robust summer, fueled by strong consumer spending on travel, concert tours and movie blockbusters. The economy is estimated to have grown at a healthy 3.5% annual rate in the July-September quarter, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.Yet growth will likely slow to a meager 0.7% annual rate in the final three months of the year, Goldman estimates. With borrowing rates high and inflation still relatively elevated, consumers, who drive about 70% of economic growth, are expected to spend more cautiously.On Friday, the government will provide a snapshot of how employers are factoring the turmoil into their hiring plans when it issues the September jobs report. Economists have forecast that it will show that employers added a solid 162,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate dipped to 3.7%, near a half-century low, from 3.8%.Story continuesBut the substantial rise in borrowing costs could intensify the economy's slowdown. The yield on the 10-year Treasury touched a 16-year high of 4.8% on Tuesday, up from 3.3% in April. Last week, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage hit 7.3%, the highest rate in 23 years, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.On Tuesday, Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said she and other Fed policymakers will have to consider the rise in long-term rates in deciding whether to raise their key rate once more before year's end. Her remarks suggested that the higher borrowing costs might lead the Fed to forgo another hike.“That will influence not only our policy decisions but how the economy evolves over the next year,” Mester said. “Those tighter, higher rates will have an impact on the economy.”Financial analysts point to several reasons for the rapid increase in lending rates. To begin with, the Fed has repeatedly underscored that it intends to keep its key rate elevated for much longer than financial markets had expected earlier this year. And the economy's ability to keep growing, even as the Fed has jacked up rates, has lent the impression that it can withstand higher borrowing costs.The economy's resilience in the face of higher rates could mean that borrowing costs will stay higher than they did after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, which led the Fed to cut its rate to near zero. During that period, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to as low as 1.5%, and mortgage rates even fell below 3% during the pandemic.The Treasury Department is now also auctioning off more debt to cover the government's swelling budget deficit, which reached $1.5 trillion this year and is expected to rise further in 2024. The supply of Treasurys is growing even as the Fed is reducing its holding of bonds. Overseas buyers have reduced their purchases, thereby forcing rates higher to attract buyers.“All of that is driving these fears of higher rates, and no one knows when it’s going to stop,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities.Benson Durham, a former Fed economist who is head of global policy at Piper Sandler, suggested that long-term rates are rising because investors consider it riskier to hold government debt for the long run when the economy appears particularly volatile and uncertain, as it does now.And Fed officials, Durham noted, have shifted from well-telegraphed rate hikes to a hazier stance. Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stressed that the central bank is “data dependent,"" meaning it will raise rates again only if the latest economic data supports doing so — or forgo a rate hike if inflation falls steadily.“What they’re really telling us is, ‘We’re all over it like a cheap suit, but we’re not sure what exactly we’re going to do,’ ” Durham said.In addition to higher rates, student loans are expected to take a noticeable bite out of the economy. Roughly 43 million people will resume paying several hundred dollars a month to the government, which Goldman estimates could cut one-half of a percentage point from annual growth in the October-December quarter. More expensive gas could shave an additional 0.3 percentage point from growth in both the fourth quarter and the first three months of next year, Goldman estimates.A government shutdown, should it occur next month, would lop another 0.2 percentage point off growth for each week it endures, according to calculations by Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics.“We think the narrative is going to shift quite materially before the end of the year,” said David Page, head of macro research at AXA IM, a London-based investment manager, who expects the economy to actually shrink in the fourth quarter.Rather than optimism for a “soft landing,” in which inflation is curbed without causing a recession, there will be renewed fears of a downturn, he said."

Eleanor Pringle,Ray Dalio warns Biden’s chip ban is similar to the pre-WW2 oil sanctions the U.S. placed on Imperial Japan—which partly led to Pearl Harbor,"The White House may inadvertently be repeating history by restricting the amount of advanced semiconductors the U.S. exports to China—and if it’s not careful, could repeat the escalations that led to Pearl Harbor. That’s the warning from legendary investor Ray Dalio, who has long advocated for a positive relationship between China and America.Dalio, who founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975, told an audience at the Greenwich Economic Forum that the U.S. finds itself in a “much similar situation” with China, as it did with Japan during World War II.In 1940 the U.S. halted exports to Japan, froze Japanese assets held in U.S. banks, and stopped any negotiations with Japanese diplomats, as tensions between the two sides heightened.Japan, facing down serious shortages and with seemingly no way to negotiate with the U.S., launched an attack on Pearl Harbor in December a year later.And Dalio fears that measures recently announced by the Commerce Department, which will curb shipments of AI chips and chipmaking tools to China as early as October, could heighten tensions in the way a similar move did in the 1940s.“The reason in World War II—war with Japan—you had the cutting off of the oil and then sanctioning them, taking their payments,” Dalio said in a conversation with Bloomberg TV’s David Westin. “So you have a somewhat similar situation. Chips is like oil back then, and it’s a very, very, very delicate issue.”The chip embargo—which U.S. officials say is one to stabilize the relationship between the nations—is one of a series of factors adding fuel to the fire, Dalio added.‘On the brink of red lines’The self-proclaimed sinophile said the two major world powers are inching toward the point of no return on a number of issues.“These irreconcilable differences, they’re right on the brink,” Dalio said.Dalio—whose book Principles: Life and Work was a bestseller in China after it debuted in a translated version—said the “Taiwan issue” was high on this list of tensions.Story continuesTaiwan has been governed independently of China since the 1940s, however officials in Bejing still see the island as part of its territory.For its part, the U.S. has a long-standing “One China” policy, which is the diplomatic acknowledgment of China’s position that there is a single Chinese government.The U.S. Department of State said in a statement last year: “We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side; we do not support Taiwan independence; and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means.”As such, Dalio explained that any diversion from that long-held agreement could prove devastating: “The breaking point is if the United States said, ‘We are in favor of the independence of Taiwan.’ That’s the equivalent of a declaration of war.“And because of our political issues now, internally, you are going to be likely to push that—because of the fact that many in the Congress and so on would say, ‘We’ll defend Taiwan.’”Nobody wants a warThankfully for the global population, Dalio is also convinced that neither the U.S. nor China wants to enter into a conflict.“Neither country wants to go to war,” the man reportedly worth $16.5 billion continued. “Everybody’s afraid of what that war would be like because it would be devastating economically and politically.”High-profile individuals like Janet Yellen are also doing their part to try and solidify the U.S.-China relationship.Following a trip to Beijing this summer, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury admitted that no single visit would “solve our challenges overnight.”However, she added that decoupling from China would be “disastrous for both countries and destabilizing for the world,” and noted that any separation would be “virtually impossible to undertake.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
Josh Schafer,Wage growth keeps slowing for job switchers as US labor market cools off,"Leaving your job for that shiny new opportunity doesn't pay like it used to. New data out Wednesday from ADP shows median year-over-year pay increases for job switchers fell to 9% in September, the slowest rate of growth since June 2021. At their peak, workers saw roughly 16% year-over-year pay increases on average, more than double that of those who stayed at their job.But Wednesday's data showed the difference between wage growth gained by leaving a job versus staying is at its slimmest margin since October 2020.""We are seeing a steepening decline in jobs this month,"" ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said in a press release. ""Additionally, we are seeing a steady decline in wages in the past 12 months.""<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15239214/embed?auto=1></iframe>The ADP National Employment Report report showed 89,000 private payroll jobs were added to the US economy in September. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected job additions of 150,000 for the month. The report comes amid a busy week for labor market news that kicked off in earnest with the latest Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, which revealed job openings unexpectedly picked up in August. The surprise headline of the report sent stocks lower as investors feared a strong economy may mean more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. But in the fine print, there were signs of the economy cooling.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards After years of aggressive hiring in a hot labor market, the hire rate in August was 3.7%, unchanged from the month prior, and below its pre-pandemic level. The quit rate was also unchanged in August at 2.3%, down from the historically high 3% seen in April 2022, showing fewer workers are seeking opportunity outside of their current job.""The improved rate of retention comes as the pay premium for switching jobs has narrowed and a declining share of workers view jobs as plentiful,"" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ""The lower rate of voluntary turnover should further reduce wage pressures and job openings as employers have fewer positions to backfill.""Story continuesEasing wage pressures would likely be a welcome sign in the Fed's fight against inflation. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said a rebalancing of the labor market, including a better balance of job supply and worker demand, is needed to keep inflation on its downward path. Part of that better balance includes more normal wage gains.""Nominal wage growth must ultimately slow to a rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation,"" Powell said during his speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium.<img alt=""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a town hall meeting with teachers at the Federal Reserve Board Building, Thursday, Sept. 28, 2023, in Washington.

Associated Press Finance,Saudi Arabia says it will maintain production cuts that have helped drive oil prices up,"Saudi Arabia on Wednesday confirmed that it will maintain a production cut of 1 million barrels of oil a day through the end of the year.The announcement could further prop up oil prices, which are hovering around $90 a barrel. Production cuts first announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia in July have driven up prices at the pump, enriched Moscow's war chest and complicated global efforts to bring down inflation.The Saudi Energy Ministry reaffirmed that the cuts would continue through the end of the year in a brief statement posted on its website Wednesday attributed to “an official source.” It said the kingdom would continue to produce 9 million barrels per day in November and December.“The source stated that this voluntary cut decision will be reviewed next month to consider deepening the cut or increasing production,” the statement said.Benchmark U.S. crude oil for November delivery rose 41 cents to $89.23 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude for December delivery rose 21 cents to $90.92 a barrel.Saudi Arabia is counting on high oil prices to help fund Vision 2030, an ambitious plan by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to overhaul the economy, reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil and create jobs for young people."
LEAH WILLINGHAM,Child care programs just lost thousands of federal dollars. Families and providers scramble to cope,"WILLIAMSON, W.Va. (AP) — Kaitlyn Adkins is studying law to help families in her community impacted by the opioid epidemic at the heart of West Virginia coal country.But to do that, she needs someone to help look after her three toddlers. The first-generation college graduate said she wouldn’t be able to finish law school without access to reliable daycare.Providers say millions of children and their families are now at risk of losing that vital service. After two years of receiving federal subsidies, 220,000 child care programs across the country were cut off from funding Saturday. The largest investment in child care in U.S. history, the monthly payments ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars, and stabilized the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.“It feels like they're just setting everyone up for failure,” Adkins said, dropping her 2-year-old and 1-year-old twins at daycare on a recent morning before an hour-and-a-half drive to class.For years, providers have been raising alarm about an unsustainable business model that burdens families with high costs and leaves centers with razor-thin profit margins — issues only exacerbated by inflation and a significant workforce shortage.Now, providers say that without additional investment, they face the possibility of shutdown. The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank in Washington, D.C., analyzed a provider survey and government data, and concluded that in five states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia — as well as Washington, D.C., up to half of all providers may be forced to close.Many families and providers are calling on Congress to create a permanent funding solution to the crisis, warning of the ripple effects on the nation's economy. A Democratic proposal failed last month without any Republican support. It would have continued the grants for five years with $16 billion allocated annually.The most at-risk providers are those in rural communities that predominately serve low-income families. In West Virginia, where a quarter of all children live in poverty, the situation is especially dire.Story continuesAdkins brings her children to a center affiliated with a church in Williamson, West Virginia, where nearly 90% of families qualify for federal aid to help cover child care costs. For a family of four, that means making less than $45,000 a year. Williamson is the seat of Mingo County, where one in three residents live below the poverty line, and more than 75% of children in the county school system are being raised by someone other than their parents, often grandparents.Most mornings, Adkins wakes up at 5:30 a.m. to shuttle her kids to Living Water Child Care Center. She typically gets home late, and plays with and bathes her children before studying until early morning.The proud daughter of a former coal miner, Adkins said she's witnessed the loss of coal jobs and the influx of opioids in the state with the highest rate of overdoses. She said taxpayers will end up paying more in the long run to welfare programs if the government doesn't make investments now in child care.""We’re seeing our kids really suffer — and that’s a big problem,” said Adkins, who wants to practice law focused on child abuse and neglect. “If they have no structure and no guidance, we’re going to keep repeating cycles.”Starting in October 2021, Democrats' American Rescue Plan Act disbursed $24 billion in payments to providers across the country, with varied funding based on program size and quality rating. In West Virginia, centers received an average $5,000 to $27,000 a month and family providers got between $750 to $3,200. The legislation also included $15 billion to expand the block grant program that subsidizes the cost of child care for low-income families, though it is set to expire in September 2024.At Living Water, a $7,000 monthly subsidy went to purchasing new curriculum and advancing employee certifications, according to Director Jackie Branch. The investment paid off: In April, the center moved up a tier in its state quality rating, increasing its monthly stabilization funding to $11,000.When staffers realized many children didn't get outside playtime at home, they installed a rubber playground and colorful sunshades.School-aged kids can finally work on homework assignments in the after-school program thanks to recently purchased computers.Like most providers in the state, Living Water was also able to offer staff bonuses.As of May 2022, the median pay for a child care worker in the U.S. was $13.71, compared with $10.47 in West Virginia, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. Wage growth in the industry has fallen behind other low-wage professions.Over the years, Goldie Huff, a waitress at a steakhouse in Williamson, has cared for more than two dozen foster care children. There are just two child care centers in the entire county, and the community can't afford to lose either one, she said.“It would be horrible,” she said, if Living Waters closed. All of her foster children have attended Living Water, along with kids, grandchildren and other family members. The state has the highest number of youth in foster care in the country.She said a lot of the kids she cares for are recovering from traumatic childhood experiences and need structure. “How many kids do you know that don’t wake up to breakfast? They don’t know where the meals are coming from. They’ve not had baths. They’ve never had nice clothes.""The center serves three meals a day, plus snacks. They also distribute donations such as clothes and school supplies.Branch said it will be an uphill battle to find other grants to make up for lost funds.Policymakers should not only be worried about shuttering centers, but also about the quality of care and education available with such limited resources, said Melissa Colagrosso, CEO of A Place To Grow Children’s Center, in Fayetteville, West Virginia. Since they opened 28 years ago, the number of accredited centers in the state has been halved.“Right in the beginning, that’s our opportunity to really change the brain and change a child’s future,"" she said. “You invest in early childhood, then you invest less in prisons.”West Virginia’s Department of Health and Human Resources announced last week it was sending providers a final bonus payment as September drew to a close, but that funds were tapped. The agency also allocated $24 million in TANF funds to reimburse providers for children whose costs are subsidized based on enrollment rather than attendance for another year.But providers say what they need instead is a permanent, long-term funding solution.If West Virginia wants to grow its economy, child care is part the infrastructure necessary for that to happen, Tiffany Gale said. She isn't a parent herself, but just months before the pandemic started, she began caring for six children at her home in West Virginia's northern panhandle.In just three years, she’s moved up a level in the state’s quality rating status and expanded into an empty commercial space downtown. She has five staff members and 18 children — 24 split between the two sites — who would have otherwise been waitlisted. Three-quarters of them are considered low-income, and qualify for government-subsidized care.With the help of federal subsidies, Gale was able to purchase the two units next door. But now that the pandemic-era support is ending, Gale doesn’t know if she'll be able to stay in business.Policymakers have relied on the passion of child care providers — who are mostly women — to find a way to make ends meet without the resources and support they really need, Gale said.“They’re still going to do it, whether they’re living in poverty and having to go to the food bank every week or not,” she said, of child care workers' commitment to work. ""I think we really take advantage of that instead of lifting them up, lifting children up and lifting our communities up.”"
REBECCA SANTANA,That blaring noise you heard? It was a test of the federal government's emergency alert system,"WASHINGTON (AP) — “THIS IS A TEST"": If you have a cellphone or were watching television Wednesday, you should have seen that message flash across your screen as the federal government tested its emergency alert system used to tell people about emergencies.The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System sends out messages via the Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alerts.The Emergency Alert System is a national public warning system that's designed to allow the president to speak to the American people within 10 minutes during a national emergency via specific outlets such as radio and television. And Wireless Emergency Alerts are short messages — 360 characters or less — that go to mobile phones to alert their owner to important information.While these types of alerts are frequently used in targeted areas to alert people in the area to things like tornadoes, Wednesday's test was done across the country.Antwane Johnson, the director of FEMA's Integrated Public Alert and Warning System which conducted the test, said afterward that he's confident the test performed as expected but that the government would gather and analyze data in the coming weeks to assess how it went. He estimated hundreds of millions of people received Wednesday's message.Johnson said he'd already received reports from across the country of people who'd received the alerts including from colleagues at a conference for emergency managers in Tennessee. From where he observed the test, Johnson said he saw the entire map “light up.”“I am totally elated,” he said.The test was slated to start at at 2:20 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, although some phones started blaring just a few minutes before that. Wireless phone customers in the United States whose phones were on got a message saying: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” The incoming message also made a loud noise.Story continuesCustomers whose phones were set to the Spanish language should have gotten the message in Spanish.The test is conducted over a 30-minute window, although mobile phone owners should only get the message once. If their phones were turned off at 2:20 p.m. and then turned on in the next 30 minutes, they should have gotten the message when they turned their phones back on. If they turn their phones on after the 30 minutes have expired they should not get the message.The message also went to people watching broadcast or cable television or listening to the radio. That messages said: “This is a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, covering the United States from 14:20 to 14:50 hours ET. This is only a test. No action is required by the public.""Federal law requires the systems be tested at least once every three years. The last nationwide test was Aug. 11, 2021.The test has spurred falsehoods on social media that it's part of a plot to send a signal to cellphones nationwide to activate nanoparticles such as graphene oxide that have been introduced into people’s bodies. Experts and FEMA officials have dismissed those claims, but some social media users said they planned to shut off their cellphones Wednesday.FEMA spokesman Jeremy Edwards said after the test was done that people have every right to turn their phones off to avoid the test but the organization hopes that after the test is done they make sure they turn their alerts back on because it's designed to make sure people can be reached in an emergency.People on social media also suggested turning off phones for other reasons, such as not disturbing students and teachers in classrooms or children during naptimes at day care. At the White House, messages taped to chairs in the press briefing room asked members of the media to turn off their cellphones during the daily briefing.Not everyone did.Shortly before 2:20 p.m., journalists’ and staff’s phones began buzzing in the briefing room.“Oh! There we go,” said press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. After joking that the briefing was over, she added: “It works. Every couple of years, folks.”Alarms continued to sporadically go off for a few minutes afterward.Secretary of State Antony Blinken was speaking at an event at the University of Texas at Austin when cell phones in the audience went off, briefly disrupting the conversation. At the time the conversation was focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine.“It might be our Russian friends interrupting us,” Blinken joked. “But I’m glad to know the national alert system works.”The test also sparked discussion about how it could affect people in abusive situations. Some people in abusive situations have secret cellphones — usually with notifications muted — hidden from their abuser that allow them to keep contact with the outside world. Organizations that work with abuse survivors recommended they turn off their phones entirely during the 30-minute-long test Wednesday so as to not have the blaring noise give away to their abuser the fact that they have a secret phone.___Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report."
Eleanor Pringle,Bank of America warned consumers they would be pushed to the ‘point of pain’—and CEO Brian Moynihan says we’ve now reached that point,"It’s a message now echoing in every corner of Wall Street: Consumers have finally run out of steam.It’s also an eventuality Bank of America has predicted since March, when analysts warned that the Fed would push consumers to the “point of pain” in order to tame inflation.And now, according to Bank of America’s CEO, Brian Moynihan, that time has come.Speaking to CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Moynihan said the way consumers are acting is consistent with a “low growth, low inflation economy,” which the U.S. saw from 2016 to 2019.In a given year, Bank of America customers spend $4 trillion dollars—be it using a debit or credit card, writing a check, confirming a bank transfer, or taking cash out to spend.From 2021 to 2022 that spend grew by 10%, Moynihan said, and began dropping to 9% in the first quarter of 2023.Now that growth figure has dropped to 4.5%, he added, signaling consumers are either too nervous to spend the money they have, or have less in their pandemic-boosted savings accounts to sustain their spending levels.“That is the same of September and October,” Moynihan continued. “That growth rate…is consistent to where we were in ’16, ’17, ’18, ’19, which was a low growth, low inflation economy.”“Consumers’ activity has slowed down…It’s slowed by half, and that means the consumer is being slowed down by the interest rate environment and all the stuff going on.”Lower-income homes are impacted moreMoynihan went on to support an observation made by Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, who said “cracks” are beginning to show in consumer spending, particularly by lower-end consumers.Fraser said that while Citi’s data shows consumer spending is still “good” and is in positive figures, the growth has begun to “come off,” explaining to CNBC that in September numbers, “the softening of the growth in demand, is…evident.”Savings are down for lower-end consumers, Fraser added: “They’re very low at the moment, and I think some of the excess savings from the COVID years are close to depletion.”Story continuesMoynihan said that Bank of America has found similar trends. He said median-income households have lower account balances and are spending down their pandemic war chests.Higher-income households have similarly moved their money out of checking accounts, but have instead moved their fortunes into investments.“You’re seeing that deterioration of positive balances and consumers in those medium-income households down a little bit,” Moynihan said. “That means they’re spending some money in excess of what they bring in. So that means the economy has slowed down, consistent with a low growth, low inflation economy.”Is the Fed’s plan working?If the so-called YOLO (you only live once) spenders have indeed run dry and the economy is inching back, as Moynihan says, to low growth—then has the Fed’s plan really paid off?The first priority of the Fed was to tackle inflation—which has indeed come down. In September 2023, inflation sat at 3.7%, down from 8.3% a year prior.Economists seem largely satisfied by this effort—though many have warned the most difficult part of bringing inflation down lies ahead.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen remarked inflation is being “really well behaved,” while Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel believes rates will hold steady in November.In his weekly Wisdom Tree commentary, professor Siegel observed there is still a great deal of economic uncertainty—not least tensions in the Middle East.Despite this, professor Siegel wrote: “We’re poised for a year-end rally in equities and a good year for 2024.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
Jeannine Mancini,"Warren Buffett's Daughter-In-Law Gave Him Her Financial Statements As A Christmas Gift One Year: 'I Just Wanted To Show Him, Look, We're Doing Good'","Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is no ordinary gift recipient. Known for his extraordinary success in investing, he has remained one of the world's wealthiest people for years.Shopping for a family member is often challenging, but when that family member is Buffett, the dilemma becomes even more unique: What can you possibly give a billionaire who already has everything?Mary Buffett, who was married to Warren Buffett's son Peter, faced this question during their first Christmas as a married couple. She and Peter owned a music business, leveraging her prior experience as a Columbia Records executive and manager for Playboy's late Founder Hugh Hefner.Don’t Miss: Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups. Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O’Leary-backed startup lets you become a venture capitalist with $100.Many NBA players, including LeBron James, have ventured into fine wine investments as an alternative asset. Now you can too with just $25.During a 2019 interview with ThinkAdvisor, Mary Buffett said, ""The first year we were married, I realized, ‘Warren is very rich, therefore, he doesn't want anything.'"" This led her to an unconventional gift choice: She presented her father-in-law with the balance sheet of their music company to show they were profitable.Mary Buffett made it clear that her gift wasn't an investment pitch. She simply wanted to show that they were doing well financially, a subtle but powerful affirmation of Buffett's philosophy of enabling others to make their own way rather than providing them with unearned success. She clarified, ""I just wanted to show him, ‘Look, we're doing good.'""The uniqueness of Mary Buffett's Christmas gift to Warren Buffett becomes even more meaningful when viewed through the lens of Buffett's approach to family and wealth. He's well-known for his belief in giving his children enough resources to take initiative but not so much that they lose the drive to accomplish things on their own. He famously said the perfect inheritance is ""enough money so that they would feel they could do anything but not so much that they would do nothing.""Story continuesTrending: Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.For those curious about what spending Christmas with Buffett entails, his daughter-in-law provided some insight.""When the family got together in Laguna over Christmastime, all the titans of industry would be there,"" she said. The conversation naturally gravitated toward companies and investing, subjects that were always top of mind for Buffett.When asked what Buffett gave as Christmas gifts, she explained that he would typically give each family member $10,000 in hundred-dollar bills every Christmas. Then one year, he gave them $10,000 in shares of Coca-Cola stock with a note explaining they could save it or cash it in. Each year he continued giving them $10,000 of shares in his favorite stocks, which varied.Mary Buffett has since moved on to other ventures, including writing multiple books about her famed former father-in-law and lecturing on business and finance.Buffett didn't amass his fortune by waiting for opportunities to come to him. He actively sought them out and invested wisely. This mindset isn't just for the ultra-wealthy or financial experts; it's a principle that anyone can apply. Whether you’re considering investing in blue-chip stocks or the more uncertain yet potentially rewarding world of startups, taking the initiative is crucial.Buffett's principles of informed decision-making, diversification and taking calculated risks can be applied broadly, even to emerging sectors like healthcare and new technologies. These sectors offer numerous opportunities for anyone to invest in startups, even with as little as $500. Buffett's approach is not so much about having a financial head start, often referred to as a ""silver spoon,"" but more about adopting a disciplined and educated approach to investing.Read Next:As Jack Ma once said, “Opportunities lie in the place where complaints are.” Unearth such opportunities in this promising startup.Power players like Arianna Huffington and Sheryl Sandberg recognize the value in startups.

Dawn Allcot,Biden Unveils Plan To Increase US Homeownership — How It Benefits Low-to-Middle-Income Families Looking To Build Generational Wealth,"Shutterstock / ShutterstockWhile many upper-income individuals in big cities are eschewing homeownership in favor of renting, as recently reported by GOBankingRates, owning a home remains part of the American dream for many low-to-middle-income families.Housing Market 2023: The 10 Most Overpriced Housing Markets in the US — 5 Are in FloridaLearn: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000The Biden Administration is seeking ways to help families make that happen with a number of new initiatives for first-time homebuyers.Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit Offers Down Payment Assistance and MoreThe Biden-Harris Administration recently announced the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, along with down payment assistance for select first-time homebuyers. The program is designed to create a path to homeownership for first-generation or low-wealth buyers whose parents have never owned a home, either.The Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit has not yet been signed by Congress. If it does pass, it will allocate $16 billion in funding to build or rehabilitate 400,000 new homes across the U.S., according to a statement from the White House issued on Monday, Oct. 16. Additionally, the package will provide $10 billion in down payment assistance and $100 million to supplement first-time homebuyers.Policy Changes Could Make It Easier to Qualify for Mortgages at Lower RatesAdditional changes to existing policies could make it easier for some prospective homebuyers to qualify for a loan. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would allow lenders to factor in a positive rental history and on-time student loan payments when they evaluate an applicant’s creditworthiness.That means even someone without a strong history of revolving credit, car loans, or personal loans could qualify for a mortgage at a lower interest rate as long as they show that they have paid their bills, including rent, responsibly in the past.The policy, introduced by HUD through the FHA, also allows homebuyers to use a portion of rental income from Accessory Dwelling Units in the house they are purchasing or building to count as effective income when qualifying for an FHA-insured mortgage, according to the White House release.Story continuesIf someone builds or buys a home with an accessory apartment, or intends to add-on to the house with an additional dwelling, a portion of that unrealized rental income can factor into their mortgage qualifications.“The flexibilities will help more first-time homebuyers, seniors, and inter-generational families leverage ADUs to build generational wealth through homeownership while creating new affordable housing in their communities,” said the White House release.Additional Policy Changes Carve a Path to HomeownershipHUD, through FHA, is also updating the 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program. The policy changes could make it easier for homebuyers and homeowners to finance repair costs prior to a home’s purchase or to refinance their mortgage and tap into their home equity to fund improvements. Under the new policies, they might have more time to complete repairs and improvements prior to purchase.The USDA, simultaneously, is working on launching a pilot program to expand eligibility criteria for Community Land Trust Organizations through the Section 502 Direct Loan Program. Community Land Trusts are non-profit organizations devoted to making homeownership more affordable. Prospective homeowners can lease, rather than purchase, the land, making the overall cost of their home more affordable since they are only purchasing the house. The homeowners must agree to sell the home at a restricted price in order to maintain affordable housing in the community for generations, according to GroundedSolutions.org.Downsizing for Retirement? Stay Away From These 7 HomesBuilding on Past SuccessThese initiatives are designed to build on the past success of the Biden Administration to expand access to homeownership. Data released by the White House shows that first-time homebuying rates are the highest they’ve been since 2000.The FHA has helped 1.8 million homeowners secure mortgages since Biden took office; 1.5 million of those new homeowners (83.6%) were first-time buyers.In the past year, the USDA provided 7,100 direct housing loans, subsidizing homebuyers with interest rates as low as 1%. The average homebuyer that benefited from the program has an income of just $42,918.Bottom LineIf homeownership is one of your dreams or a marker of financial success to you, 2024 might be the year it happens. These programs could help lower- and middle-income Americans begin to build generational wealth through a tangible asset — a family home that is likely to appreciate in value over time while providing a sense of security and stability.More From GOBankingRatesTop 7 Countries with Zero Income TaxHere Are All the States That Don't Tax Social Security Benefits3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement5 Ways to Elevate Your Finances DailyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Biden Unveils Plan To Increase US Homeownership — How It Benefits Low-to-Middle-Income Families Looking To Build Generational Wealth"
"Daniel Brown,Elias Chavez","We toured the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which can house 75 aircraft (but doesn't have urinals)","The flight deck of the USS Gerald R. Ford.Daniel Brown/Business InsiderThe USS Gerald R. Ford is the world's largest aircraft carrier.It is the first of the Ford-class carriers and the most technologically advanced carrier to date.The US has sent the carrier toward Israel to deter any potential escalation in the ongoing conflict.The USS Gerald R. Ford is the US Navy's newest and largest aircraft carrier — in fact, it's the world's largest.Commissioned in July 2017, it is the first of the Ford-class carriers, which are more technologically advanced than Nimitz-class carriers.It has an improved hull design and weapons stowage, a new weapons elevator, more space on the flight deck, a new electromagnetic-powered aircraft-launch system, three times the electrical-generation capacity of any previous carrier, and a lot more.The USS Gerald R. Ford launched on its first deployment in 2023 to the Mediterranean. The carrier and its strike force are en route toward Israel to provide support after an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas killed 1,400 people.Israel responded with a series of airstrikes on Gaza and most recently issued an evacuation order over the weekend, ordering 1.1 million people out of northern Gaza within a 24-hour deadline. The counter-attack from Israel has killed nearly 3,000 Palestinian people and injured more than 10,000 in Gaza, according to data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.As of October 10, 2023, the USS Gerald R.

Alexandra Canal,Roku stock falls 8% after Wall Street analyst warns of more ad market 'softness',"Roku stock (ROKU) slid 8% on Wednesday after a Wall Street analyst warned softness in the ad market will continue to impact the company's earnings through the end of the year.In a new note released Tuesday night, Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall lowered his price target on shares to $70 from $84, citing concerns the fourth quarter ""could see softness from ad trends.""""We heard at our Advertising Day last month that scatter remains weak quarter-over-quarter, while Roku will also face a reduction in media and entertainment spend due to the ongoing Hollywood strikes,"" Cahall wrote. Scatter refers to ad inventory that isn't purchased during upfront sales.The analyst added that although Roku likely has more upfront inventory in Q4 compared to last year ""it's unclear how upfront pricing compares both year-over-year and to current scatter since this year's TV Upfronts occurred amidst a weak ad environment.""Cahall said he expects softer fourth quarter guidance as a result, anticipating that revenue per streaming hour will fall 8% year over year in Q4 compared to an estimated 4% annual drop in Q3.The analyst also cut his estimates for Q4 platform revenue by 1% to $780 million — 3% below consensus expectations — meaning total revenue would be $929 million, a 7% year-over-year gain but still 3% below Wall Street projections.That lower overall revenue would also hit gross profits with the analyst expecting $379 million in fourth quarter profits, 6% below the Street.Roku stock is down about 17% over the past three months but has soared more than 50% since the start of the year.In Roku's second quarter results, brand advertising remained pressured as total US advertising came in flat year over year. Spending on traditional TV fell 9.4% while traditional TV ad scatter sank 17.2%.At the time, management warned the Hollywood strikes would continue to negatively impact media and entertainment spending through the back half of the year — a notable challenge given the heavy promotions Roku provides for content.Story continuesTo combat some of these hurdles and bring down operating expenses, Roku revealed a slew of cost-cutting measures last month, which included layoffs.The company said it would be eliminating 10% of its workforce, or 300 jobs, in addition to slowing down its pace of hiring. The announcement marked Roku's third round of layoffs in less than a year after it cut 200 jobs in March 2023 and another 200 in November 2022.Excluding charges related to items such as severance and the removal of select content from its streaming platform, Roku said it expects third quarter net revenue in the range of $835 million to $875 million, with adjusted EBITDA in the range of negative $40 million to negative $20 million. This is ahead of its previous Q3 forecast for revenue of roughly $815 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $50 million.<img alt=""FILE - This Aug. 13, 2020 file photo shows a logo for Roku on a remote control in Portland, Ore.

Jeremiah Budin,Viral video shows Tesla owner using controversial method to charge their EV at home: ‘I don’t see a problem’,"One TikTok user recently revealed the method they use to charge their Tesla, setting the comments section ablaze in the process.“You was too cheap to get the Tesla charger installed in your garage so now you gotta pull your car up to the backyard to connect it to the stove outlet just to get 20 miles of charge an hour,” Rickie (@rickologist), a North Carolina-based content creator, wrote.The accompanying video shows the charger coming into the kitchen via a window that is propped open with a towel and plugged into the wall with the regular 120-volt plug adapter that comes with the car. The stove is pulled away from the wall to make room. It does not seem like the ideal charging scenario.The TikTok is tagged #teslamodely and #newcar. A new Tesla Model Y is currently priced at $50,490 before tax credit.Although it seems like there is at least a decent chance that Rickie set this convoluted charging system up just to make a viral post to share with their over 150,000 followers, it is also possible that this is really how they charge their $50,000 EV on a regular basis. Either way, the commenters leaped at the opportunity to roast the whole setup.“How you got money for the Tesla but not the charger?” wrote one commenter.“LMAO. Someone did this at work and it destroyed a bunch of appliances,” wrote another.“Look [online] for certified electricians,” wrote another. “I got my moms installed for $200 since I bought the charger already.”“This is the 2023 version of ‘got a quarter tank of gas, in my new E class,’” wrote another commenter, referencing the 2002 classic “Still Fly” by Big Tymers.Many of the comments were also in support of Rickie’s charging system, however.“Lol it work I don’t see a problem,” wrote one commenter. “We gone find a way.”Join our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet."
Sabina Wex,'We were living our best lives': This 32-year-old man says he had more financial freedom working at Chili's in 2012 than he does today with a much higher income — here's why,"While it’s not hard to get a millennial to indulge in some nostalgia for the 2010s — the decade many of their cohort entered adulthood and the workforce — what’s got them reminiscing about their younger years lately may come as a surprise.Although many were fresh out of college, still figuring things out and living on minimum wage, they’d likely hesitate to characterize their past selves as “young, dumb and broke.” But not necessarily because they remember themselves as wise and mature.Don't missCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlordRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds‘A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency — 3 ways you can prepareAs Mordecai Nuccio explains in a recent TikTok, it all comes down to money. Nuccio feels he had more disposable income back in 2012 compared to now — an assertion that’s been making the rounds on TikTok.“We were making minimum wage, but we were living our best lives,” Nuccio, a 32-year-old photographer, says about his time living on minimum wage working as a food runner at Chili’s.He adds that a big part of his current financial stress is thanks to his increased credit card and student loan debts. Even though he makes more money and lives in a double-income household with his fiancé, he feels more squeezed.Here’s how do you get back to living your best life now that you should have more cash flow.Tackle debtBack in 2012, Nuccio says he had “minimal” credit card debt. But that’s changed as his expenses have increased — and he’s got his student loans to think of too.While expenses tend to increase as you age and take on more responsibilities, making more often translates into spending more. Millennials love splurging on experiences, but that can quickly wander into risky spending habit territory.Story continuesIf you’ve racked up a couple of balances, one way to start picking away at your debt in a manageable way is to use the “debt avalanche method,”.Here’s how it works: you pay off your highest interest loan debt first, and only make minimum payments on all your other debts.Once you’ve paid off the highest interest loan, you move on to the next highest interest debt, and so on — until, voila, all your debt has disappeared.Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howConsolidate your debtUp until recently, student loan payments were suspended. But their return means that borrowers like Nuccio need to figure out how to fit these payments back into their monthly expenses.Unfortunately, 28% of student loan borrowers say they’ll need to take on additional debt to maintain their household payments and repay their student debt, according to a recent Achieve survey.When you’re robbing Paul to pay Peter, things can get messy. But consolidating your debts can make this a little easier. If you have private student loans and credit card debt, you might consider refinancing your loan.Even though it means taking on another loan, if you're able to find an offer at a lower rate than your current accounts, you'll save yourself plenty in interest over the life of the loan. Plus, by pooling your debts, you'll only have to worry about making a single monthly payment, which will hopefully make your life a little easier.Lower your cost of livingNuccio mentions that he lived in Tampa, Florida in 2012 when he worked at Chili’s, but has since moved to New York City to pursue photography. Though this may have been a good move for his career, it’s bad news for his debt.Though Nuccio doesn’t explicitly say which borough he lives in, New York’s Manhattan is the most expensive city in the U.S., according to the Council for Community and Economic Research’s (CCER) most recent data. Though several Florida media outlets report Tampa is the Sunshine State’s most expensive city, it still doesn’t rank on the CCER’s list of priciest cities across the country.So part of your plan to pay back your debt may need to include your locale. If you live in an expensive city like New York, it’ll likely take you longer to pay off your debt than a cheaper city like Tampa.What to read nextWorried about the economy?

Jennifer Sor,"Long-term investors should be plowing 80% of their portfolios into stocks and other hard assets, BlackRock chief Larry Fink says","Investors should have most of their portfolio invested in stocks, Larry Fink said.REUTERS/Ruben SprichInvestors should be putting at least 80% of their portfolios into stocks and hard assets, Larry Fink said.The BlackRock CEO pointed to catalysts that could power stocks higher over the long-term.Investors with high tolerance for volatility could even have 90%-100% of their portfolios in equities, he added.Long-term investors should be allocating most of their portfolios to stocks and other hard assets, according to BlackRock chief Larry Fink.The CEO of the world's largest asset manager touted stocks and hard assets, like real estate and infrastructure as healthy long-term investments. Though financial advisors typically tell investors to allocate 60% of their holdings to stocks and 40% to bonds, there are a lot of factors that make stocks more appealing over the long-term than in past eras, Fink said in an interview with CNBC last week.For one, investors have good opportunities to put their cash into artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as companies that are nearshoring, Fink said.Investors are also likely living longer lives than they did in the past, thanks to new medical advances and drugs like Ozempic, which is seen as a potential cure for obesity, as well as breakthroughs in other areas such as Alzheimer's.A longer lifespan means investors need to be able to support themselves for longer, and should therefore tolerate more risk by investing in stocks for a longer period, versus shifting more to bonds as they get older.""For a long-term investor, with a long-term view, who can tolerate market volatility, you should be at least 80% in equities or hard assets,"" Fink said.Investors who have an especially high tolerance of volatility could even have a 90% or 100% allocation to equities, Fink added, though he noted that many investors couldn't afford big downswings if their portfolio allocations were that high.""You've got to have a 10, 20-year view,"" Fink added. ""I'm a hopeful person. I believe that in 10 years, in 20 years, humanity will be in a better position than it is today. With that view, I want to own hard assets. I want to own equity. I want to be part of this economy.""Story continuesBonds, meanwhile, could face more trouble in long-term as interest rates stay higher-for-longer. In particular, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury could surge past 5%, BlackRock strategists said in a note this week, as bond investors will soon feel pressure from the market's rising term premium. That's the yield investors are compensated for by buying long-dated US Treasury bonds, which have more interest rate risk than short-term Treasuries.Stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 up nearly 15% from the start of the year. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield ticked slightly higher to trade around 4.8%, with the latest bout of selling pressure coming as investors mull the impact on Fed policy of strong September retail sales data release Tuesday.Read the original article on Business Insider"
Susan Elizabeth Turek,First-of-its-kind technology set to revolutionize global shipping: ‘A milestone for the maritime industry’,"The vast majority of international trade takes place via our planet’s waters. Engineering and tech company ABB is helping to chart a new course to reduce the amount of harmful carbon pollution as a result.ABB is collaborating with Dutch shipping company Samskip and India’s Cochin Shipyard, a shipbuilding and maintenance facility, to bring us some of the first ocean container ships that will use a hydrogen fuel cell power distribution system, as CleanTechnica reported.“These ships are a milestone for the maritime industry,” Erik Hofmeester, the head of vessel management at Samskip, said in a press release.ABB’s proprietary onboard grid and tech package helps optimize the usage of hydrogen energy while ensuring safety, reported the Maritime Executive. The companies are beginning with the construction of two vessels that will be able to travel approximately 800 miles.William Grove, a Welsh inventor, is credited with dreaming up the hydrogen fuel cell in 1842, but the technology didn’t begin to see significant applicable development until the 1950s. The first car powered by hydrogen fuel cells wasn’t released by GM until 1966.Hydrogen is a clean energy because it only releases water when utilized. Each of the new Samskip vessels is projected to avoid the creation of roughly 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually — basically the pollution-saving equivalent of removing more than 5,000 passenger cars from the road in a year.That’s great news for the health of our planet and everyone who calls it home.According to NASA, in less than 200 years, the actions of humans have increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by 50%, which has contributed to the overheating of Earth and led to an increased risk of extreme events like wildfires.Thankfully, this effort by ABB, Samskip, and Cochin Shipyard is yet another example of promising tech and cooperation that could make our future a cleaner, safer place while maintaining international trade, as well as human connection.Story continues“ABB is at the forefront of shipping’s most ambitious plans for decarbonization and setting new standards for green maritime transportation,” Juha Koskela, the division president of ABB’s Global Marine and Ports Business, said in the press release. He further noted that operational expenses would also be reduced.The International Maritime Organization, an agency that regulates shipping, is committed to reducing pollution from international shipping by 2050, with a focus on increasing the usage of low-carbon fuels by 2030.There’s no word yet on when the ships will be ready for their first voyage, but according to the Maritime Executive, the order for them was made during the second quarter of 2023.Join our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet."
Alexandra Canal,Netflix CFO says company has 'long runway of margin growth' as streamer hikes prices,"Netflix (NFLX) said its operating margins have more room to run as the streamer leans on initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing, cheaper ad-supported tier, and newly announced price hikes. ""We don't think we're anywhere near a margin ceiling. We've got a long runway of margin growth,"" Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann said on the company's third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.Operating margin, a key profitability metric, hit 22.4% in the quarter, slightly ahead of Netflix's own projection of 22.2%. The company said it expects full-year operating margin to hit 20% — the high end of its previous forecast of 18% to 20%.The update is an encouraging sign for investors who have been hyper-focused on the company's margin outlook after Neumann doubled down last month on full-year margins falling in the range of 18% to 20%. Consensus estimates are just below 20% for full-year 2023.Neumann added the company's full-year operating margin should improve to roughly 22% to 23% next year, assuming no material swings in foreign exchange.<img alt=""(Source: Netflix Q3 earnings report)"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BU7wUnbEQQsQNYsMUTLo6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/48901890-6e0c-11ee-be5f-ee867e3f5474 class=caas-img>(Source: Netflix Q3 earnings report)Netflix did not provide a longer-term projection, although management has hinted the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to other media networks, which historically have been in the range between 40% to 50%.""We have a very scalable business model,"" Neumann said. ""It's a global network at scale that has, in many ways, not been seen with legacy entertainment networks. So we think we've got a long way to go.""The executive noted the platform will continue to take a ""disciplined approach"" when it comes to balancing margin improvement with investments for future growth.He explained there are many areas Netflix can continue to invest in such as existing content categories both domestically and overseas, in addition to building out its advertising capabilities, live programming, and new content categories like gaming.Story continuesConsumers, however, will begin to more heavily bear the cost of those investments after Netflix said it will once again hike prices in in the US, UK, and France.<img alt=""Netflix said its operating margins have more room to run after the company beat earnings expectations on both the top and bottom lines and reported a surge in subscribers.
