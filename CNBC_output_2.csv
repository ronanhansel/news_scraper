Yun Li,Wells Fargo shares rise after third-quarter results top Wall Street expectations,"In this article
Wells Fargo
on Friday surpassed Wall Street expectations for third-quarter earnings and revenue as the benefit from higher interest rates offset slowing lending activity.
Shares of the bank rose 3.1% following the report.
Wells Fargo posted earnings per share of $1.48 in the quarter, or $1.39 excluding discrete tax benefits. It was unclear what the exact comparable number was to Wall Street’s expectations, but both figures are higher than the LSEG consensus EPS of $1.24. The earnings are also significantly higher than the 86 cents per share earned in the same quarter a year ago.
Total revenue came to $20.9 billion during the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $20.1 billion, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Revenue was 6.5% higher than the $19.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2022.
“Our revenue growth from a year ago included both higher net interest income and noninterest income as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we are making in our businesses,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement.
“While the economy has continued to be resilient, we are seeing the impact of the slowing economy with loan balances declining and charge-offs continuing to deteriorate modestly,” Scharf added.
Net income rose to $5.77 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $3.59 billion a year earlier, driven by an 8% increase in net interest income.
Wells Fargo said provision for credit losses in the quarter included a $333 million increase in the allowance for credit losses for commercial real estate office loans and higher credit card loan balances."
Bertha Coombs,Pregnant Latinas face greater maternal health concerns,"Zaza Cristina Robles worked as a pregnancy coach in her native Peru, so when she arrived in the U.S. at 16 weeks pregnant, the first thing she did after settling in with her in-laws was to seek medical care.
“When they showed us the bill, it was so expensive, my husband and I thought, ‘If this is just for the doctor’s visit, imagine what the delivery will be?’ It scared us,” she said.

Her sister-in-law put her in touch with the Hispanic Health Council, a nonprofit in Hartford, Connecticut. The organization’s Comadrona — or midwife — program helps Latina immigrants and low-income pregnant women navigate the complications of the U.S. health-care system.
“They really helped clear up a lot of my fears,” Robles said.
The program helped Robles gain health-care coverage as she and her husband seek asylum in the United States. Her comadrona helped her find a doctor who treats low-income patients and connected her with other services.
“One of the things that we do here at Hispanic Council is provide birthing classes, in their own language,” said Bianca Noroñas, the Comadrona program manager.
Noroñas said coaching and social services have helped the mothers in the nonprofit’s program avoid medical complications during childbirth.
“If you don’t receive education and support, that is going to affect you directly in your life,” Noroñas said.
In the U.S., the rate of maternal morbidity — medical complications in childbirth — and maternal mortality is nearly twice as high as in other developed nations.
“We’ve been paying a lot more attention to try to understand why these differences persist and why our numbers are so high,” said Marie Thoma, a professor at the department of family science at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. “A lot of investment has been going into addressing some of these factors around the health before, during and after pregnancy that we can improve on in the U.S.”
U.S. maternal mortality worsened during the pandemic, especially for Latinas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. saw 23.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020, up 18.4% from 2019. For Black women, the maternal mortality rate jumped 25%, while for Hispanic women it surged 44%.
While researchers are not clear on why Latinas saw such disproportionately higher mortality rates in 2020, the overall trend in the U.S. has been that women of color have had poorer outcomes in childbirth.
Latinas with private insurance plans have a 22% higher rate of severe pregnancy complications than non-Hispanic white women, according to a Blue Cross Blue Shield Association study. Low-income Hispanic women on Medicaid have a 28% higher rate of complications.  
Higher rates of obesity and chronic conditions such as diabetes among women of color can play a role in maternal morbidity. Financial barriers to getting proper care also contribute to poorer outcomes for Black and Hispanic women, as well as cultural barriers in health care, said Hispanic Health Council board member Dr. Yvette Martas.
“It is the issue of being listened to,” said Martas. She said the health-care system needs to support mothers beyond the delivery room, “creating the culture where this is not a disease model, but it’s a very natural course of how we reproduce.” 
An analysis by the Commonwealth Fund calculated that the cost of maternal and child morbidity for U.S. births in 2019 reached $32.3 billion from conception through the child’s fifth birthday. That amounts to an additional $8,624 for each mother-child pair, according to the researchers.
Health insurers and large employers such as Walmart
have taken note of the problem. This year, Walmart expanded coverage for pregnancy-support programs to workers in four states by providing up to $1,000 for doula services. 
Through its pregnancy-support initiative, Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina has seen maternal and infant morbidity rates decline substantially. The insurer’s Centering Pregnancy program has cut the rate of newborns needing to go into the neonatal intensive care unit from 13.9% to 3.5% — at an average savings of $67,000 on NICU costs.
“I think offering doula programs and offering paid leave — there’s a lot of things that I think our companies can do ... that could really support moms during and then just as they return to work,” Thoma said. “It will give back to the company as well.”
Beyond pregnancy, the Comadrona program also offers postpartum support. Robles said she got help with diapers and lactation coaching. 
“Thank God ... It turned out well for us and they cared for us so well,” said Robles, whose delivery had no complications."
Michael Wayland,Ford says it’s ‘at the limit’ of what it can offer UAW as strikes escalate,"In this article
DETROIT – Ford Motor
is “at the limit” of what it can offer the United Auto Workers union in terms of economic concessions, an executive said Thursday as contract negotiations continue for roughly 57,000 U.S. workers.
Kumar Galhotra, president of the company’s traditional operations, said that while the company is willing to shuffle money around within the existing offer to meet the union’s priorities, any added costs would hurt the automaker’s ability to operate in the future and invest in emerging areas such as electric vehicles.
“We’ve been very clear that we are at the limit. We stretched to get to this point,” Galhotra said Thursday during a media and analyst call. “Going further will hurt our ability to invest in the business like we need to invest.”
Galhotra declined to disclose how much the company’s current offer to the union would cost the company.
His comments come a day after the union unexpectedly launched a strike at the automaker’s highly profitable SUV and pickup truck plant in Kentucky.
“We’re surprised by the escalation last night,” Galhotra said. “Kentucky Truck Plant is one of the most important manufacturing plants of any kind in America.”
UAW President Shawn Fain said Wednesday night that the strike escalation was a result of the company repeating its previous offer instead of offering additional economic benefits.
“This offer was the exact same offer they gave us two weeks ago. In our position, they’re not taking it seriously,” Fain said during a pre-recorded online video. “We’ve been very patient working with a company on this. At the end of the day, they have not met expectations. They’re not even coming to the table on it.”
Ford’s most recent proposal included 23%-26% wage increases depending on classification; retention of platinum health care benefits; ratification bonuses; reinstatement of cost-of-living; and other benefits.
In the past several days, Ford said, it had been negotiating outstanding issues such as retiree benefits and potential options for future battery plant workers, in line with guidance from the union.
Electric vehicle battery plants have been a major point of contention for the union in bargaining with all three of the Detroit automakers. Ford, General Motors
and Stellantis have all formed joint ventures with battery makers to manufacture EV batteries in the United States. Officially, because they’re owned by joint ventures, the battery plants aren’t and won’t be covered by the automakers’ agreements with the union.
The union has characterized the joint-venture arrangements as a plan to shut it out of the new factories, many of which are under construction now. But the UAW said last Friday that GM had agreed to place the workers at those battery plants under its national agreement with the union – a strong hint that it now expects Ford and Stellantis to do the same."
Sarah Whitten,A $150 million opening for The Eras Tour concert film? Don’t doubt Taylor Swift,"In this article
The weekend box office (Taylor’s Version).
Taylor Swift has sold out stadiums worldwide and now she’s packing cinemas, with her sights set on a $100 million opening weekend for her The Eras Tour concert film — and that’s on the conservative side.
Box office analysts predict Swift’s film could generate as much as $150 million during its debut this weekend, a figure that would make it the highest opening of a concert film ever, and also one of the highest openings of 2023.
“Taylor is in a league of her own with this release,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com.
Fervor for the tickets has picked up because a significant portion of Swift’s fanbase was unable to attend the concert in person due to high demand and secondary market price surges. The film is expected to draw those who were unable to attend, as well as spark repeat viewings.
“Given the unique nature of virtually every aspect of the marketing and theatrical release strategy of the Taylor Swift Eras Tour film, speculation is running rampant as to how massive the opening weekend will be,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst a Comscore.
Demand was so high, in fact, that Swift shifted the release date from Friday to Thursday, offering showtimes beginning at 6 p.m. local time.
“Look what you genuinely made me do,” Swift wrote on Instagram on Wednesday as she announced the early access showings in the U.S. and Canada. “We’re also adding additional showtimes Friday and throughout the weekend. All tickets will be available by 10am tomorrow morning. And it’ll be showing starting Friday in 90 countries all over the world.”

Presales for the theatrical concert have generated interest on par with the likes of Disney’s
Marvel and Star Wars franchises. Average ticket prices for the film are more than 40% higher than typical releases this year.
Base prices for tickets for standard formats start at $19.89 for adults and $13.13 for kids. The numbers reflect Swift’s birth year and her lucky number, 13. Tickets for premium format screens such as IMAX and Dolby come at a higher cost.
“Taylor is opening her movie like a traditional Hollywood tentpole in close to 4,000 theaters domestically,” Robbins said. “Whether or not Swift’s blockbuster has staying power will be up to her fans and whether or not casual audiences decide to check out the hype.”
Comscore reports the film will open in 3,850 locations, the most of any concert film ever.
Source: Comscore
AMC Entertainment
, which is distributing the film, reported last week that presales for its theaters had already exceeded $100 million for the full run of Swift’s film.
Robbins warned that because the film is only showing on the weekends, instead of full-week play like traditional movies, it could skew box office comparisons after opening weekend. Still, expectations are high that Swift’s theatrical concert will generate revenue throughout its limited engagement. It runs through Nov. 5.
Still, movie theaters are likely to see a big bump in concession sales as cinemas have designed specialty popcorn buckets and boutique cocktails for the film. Additionally, many locations have plans to set up friendship bracelet-making tables and other in-person events to make the occasion bigger and more memorable than just a trip to the movies.
“No matter what, [the film is] already an enormous success and music to the ears of theater owners,” said Robbins."
Hugh Son,"Bank earnings kick off amid concerns about rising rates, bad loans","In this article
American banks are closing out another quarter in which interest rates surged, reviving concerns about shrinking margins and rising loan losses — though some analysts see a silver lining to the industry’s woes.
Just as they did during the March regional banking crisis, higher rates are expected to lead to a jump in losses on banks’ bond portfolios and contribute to funding pressures as institutions are forced to pay higher rates for deposits.
KBW analysts Christopher McGratty and David Konrad estimate banks’ per-share earnings fell 18% in the third quarter as lending margins compressed and loan demand sank on higher borrowing costs.
“The fundamental outlook is hard near term; revenues are declining, margins are declining, growth is slowing,” McGratty said in a phone interview.
Earnings season kicks off Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase,
Citigroup
and Wells Fargo
.
Bank stocks have been intertwined closely with the path of borrowing costs this year. The S&P 500 Banks index sank 9.3% in September on concerns sparked by a surprising surge in longer-term interest rates, especially the 10-year yield, which jumped 74 basis points in the quarter.
Rising yields mean the bonds owned by banks fall in value, creating unrealized losses that pressure capital levels. The dynamic caught midsized institutions including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic off guard earlier this year, which — combined with deposit runs — led to government seizure of those banks.
Big banks have largely dodged concerns tied to underwater bonds, with the notable exception of Bank of America
. The bank piled into low-yielding securities during the pandemic and had more than $100 billion in paper losses on bonds at midyear. The issue constrains the bank’s interest revenue and has made the lender the worst stock performer this year among the top six U.S. institutions.
Expectations on the impact of higher rates on banks’ balance sheets varied. Morgan Stanley
analysts led by Betsy Graseck said in an October 2 note that the “estimated impact from the bond rout in 3Q is more than double” losses in the second quarter.
Bond losses will have the deepest impact on regional lenders including Comerica
, Fifth Third Bank
and KeyBank
, the Morgan Stanley analysts said.
Still, others including KBW and UBS analysts said that other factors could soften the capital hit from higher rates for most of the industry.
“A lot will depend on the duration of their books,” Konrad said in an interview, referring to whether banks owned shorter or longer-term bonds. “I think the bond marks will look similar to last quarter, which is still a capital headwind, but that there’ll be a smaller group of banks that are hit more because of what they own.”
There’s also concern that higher interest rates will result in ballooning losses in commercial real estate and industrial loans.
“We expect loan loss provisions to increase materially compared to the third quarter of 2022 as we expect banks to build up loan loss reserves,” RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy wrote in a Oct. 2 note.
Still, bank stocks are primed for a short squeeze during earnings season because hedge funds placed bets on a return of the chaos from March, when regional banks saw an exodus of deposits, UBS analyst Erika Najarian wrote in an Oct. 9 note.
“The combination of short interest above March 2023 levels and a short thesis from macro investors that higher rates will drive another liquidity crisis makes us think the sector is set up for a potentially volatile short squeeze,” Najarian wrote.
Banks will probably show stability in deposit levels in the quarter, according to Goldman Sachs
analysts led by Richard Ramsden. That, and guidance on net interest income in the fourth quarter and beyond, could support some banks, said the analysts, who are bullish on JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.
Perhaps because bank stocks have been so beaten down and expectations are low, the industry is due for a relief rally, said McGratty.
“People are looking ahead to, where is the trough in revenue?” McGratty said. “If you think about the last nine months, the first quarter was really hard. The second quarter was challenging, but not as bad, and the third will be still tough, but again, not getting worse.”"
Gabrielle Fonrouge,Dollar General stock jumps after it brings back former CEO,"In this article
Dollar General’s
former CEO Todd Vasos is coming out of retirement to helm the company, which aims to rebound from slowing growth and allegations of unsafe working conditions.
Vasos, who served as the discounter’s CEO between June 2015 to November 2022, will replace Jeff Owen effective immediately, the company announced on Thursday.
“The Board has tremendous respect for Jeff and greatly appreciates his many contributions to the Company, especially during his long tenure leading our retail operations,” said Michael Calbert, the chairman of the company’s board, in a statement. “However, at this time, the Board has determined that a change in leadership is necessary to restore stability and confidence in the Company moving forward.”
Owen had been in the role for less than a year. During that time, Dollar General has seen a slowdown in its sales growth and has faced criticism from federal officials and activists for having unsafe stores that put employees at risk.
The company, which is rapidly adding stores and exanding its footprint, has more than 19,000 locations in 47 states. Dollar General has more than 185,000 full- and part-time employees.
Dollar General shares jumped more than 6% in extended trading Thursday.
When it last reported earnings, Dollar General cut its full-year profit guidance. It did so again Thursday, and said it was now expecting earnings per share of about $7.10 to $7.60, compared to its previous expectation of $7.10 to $8.30.
Dollar General also said it anticipates net sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, revised from a previous expectation of 1.3% to 3.3%.
The company said it expects same-store sales to be in a range of flat to down 1% this year, versus a prior expectation of a 1% decline to a 1% increase.
Vasos said in a statement he is “honored” to rejoin the company at such a “pivotal time.”
“I look forward to getting back to work with the broader team as we strive to return to a position of operational excellence for our employees and customers and deliver sustainable long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders,” said Vasos.
Slowing sales have come amid pressure from employees and activists over working conditions. In May, shareholders passed a resolution, over the objections of the company’s board, to start an independent audit into worker safety. But it was unclear if the measure was binding and whether the company would carry it out.
Dollar General has accumulated more than $21 million in fines from federal officials for issues including blocked fire exits, blocked electrical outlets and clutter.
At the time the shareholder resolution passed, a Dollar General spokesperson said the company aims “to create a work environment where employees are able to grow their careers, serve their local communities and feel valued and heard, and we encourage employees to share their feedback through the many company-provided channels so that we can listen and work together to address concerns and challenges, as well as to celebrate successes.”"
Leslie Josephs,"Delta says Hollywood, auto strikes are denting business travel","In this article
Recent strikes by Hollywood talent and United Auto Workers union members are a “drag” on business travel demand, which is otherwise recovering, Delta Air Lines
President Glen Hauenstein said Thursday.
Delta has an outsized exposure to the automotive and entertainment industries, with a more than 70% market share at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and a nearly 20% share at Los Angeles International Airport, more than any other carrier, according to airport data.
The strikes have had “a not insignificant change in the business travel to and from Los Angeles as well as now the UAW strike, which curtailed a significant amount of the business in Detroit,” Hauenstein said on an earnings call Thursday. “We are probably the most impacted by those two sectors.”
The United Auto Workers’ targeted strikes, which began after major Detroit automakers and the union failed to reach labor deals before a September contract expiration, are entering their fourth week — and escalating.
Hollywood writers earlier this week ratified a new three-year contract after nearly 150 days of work stoppage that suspended significant film and TV production.
But Hollywood actors, represented by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, are still on strike. And late Wednesday, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents production studios like Disney
, Universal
, Netflix
and others, said talks have been been suspended with the two sides far apart on a deal.
Delta’s Hauenstein noted that demand from technology and financial services customers posted double-digit growth in the third quarter, contributing to an overall rebound for business travel.
A company survey of corporate customers found that a majority expect their travel to stay the same or increase in the last three months of this year and into 2024, Hauenstein said.

Alex Sherman,"Comcast, Disney hire investment banks to value Hulu as sale process makes progress","In this article
Comcast
and Disney
have hired investment banks to value Hulu, the next step in what’s been a nearly five-year process to put the streaming service under one owner.
Comcast, which owns one-third of Hulu, has hired Morgan Stanley
, and Disney, which owns the other two-thirds, has hired JPMorgan Chase
. Each bank is tasked with providing a fair value for Hulu — a condition of an agreement set up in 2019 that allows either Disney or Comcast to trigger an option forcing Disney to buy Comcast’s 33% stake.
Spokespeople for Comcast, Disney, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan declined to comment.
Nearly five years ago, Comcast and Disney set up an unusual agreement after Disney acquired the majority of Fox’s assets in a $71 billion deal, including Fox’s minority stake in Hulu. That deal gave Disney majority control over Hulu, because Disney already owned one-third of the streaming service.
Comcast didn’t want to sell its stake in Hulu to Disney right away because it believed the value of streaming video would increase between 2019 and 2024. Still, Comcast executives also understood the company would no longer have operational control over the future of the company. Consequently, Disney and Comcast worked out a deal where Comcast could participate in the assumed appreciation of the business while also setting a time where Disney could eventually unify ownership and integrate Hulu into its long-term streaming strategy.
Initially, the companies set an option strike date of January 2024. Last month, the two companies agreed to move up the deadline at which Hulu will be valued from January 2024 to Sept. 30. That deadline represents the final date at which Hulu’s valuation will be assessed by both Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.
On Nov. 1, Comcast can force Disney to acquire its 33% stake in Hulu and/or Disney can trigger its option to acquire the stake from Comcast. That’s expected to happen, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said at the Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia conference last month.
“We are excited to get this resolved,” Roberts said at the conference. “The company is way more valuable today than it was [in 2019]. And we are looking forward to seeing how that process [plays out].”
Once the option is triggered, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan will begin their assessments of Hulu’s value. If the two banks’ final valuations are within 10% of each other, the average of the two banks’ determinations will be the price at which Hulu is valued. Disney would then pay Comcast 33% of that value for its stake. The 2019 deal set a floor valuation for Hulu at $27.5 billion.
If the two banks’ assessments aren’t within a 10% range of each other, then Disney and Comcast would agree to hire a third investment bank to make another valuation conclusion. To set the sale price, that third valuation would then be averaged with the previous assessment that’s closest to it.
The valuation calculation process isn’t straightforward. Hulu has 48.3 million subscribers. A pure-play streaming service at its scale has never been sold before. Roberts argued during the Goldman conference that a fair appraisal would also have to include synergy value. Disney’s ownership of Hulu helps prop up Disney+ and ESPN+ subscribers because Disney bundles all three streaming services together.
There is no timetable for how long the valuation process will take or when a deal will get done, but Roberts acknowledged Disney and Comcast both want a resolution sooner rather than later, which is why they agreed to move the option strike date forward several months.
“It will take a little time for this to play out,” Roberts said. “But both companies wanted to get it behind us. So we pulled the date forward.”
Roberts said at the conference Comcast plans to return proceeds from a sale to shareholders.

Inter Miami co-owner and President David Beckham backs a takeover of his original club Manchester United
.
“At the moment, there’s no stability,” the longtime former midfielder for the Premier League club told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” in an interview aired Thursday. “It’s the right time for somebody to take over.”
Beckham also dispelled reports that he would serve as an ambassador for Manchester United in a potential sale to Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani. Beckham previously served as World Cup ambassador last year in a deal with Qatar.
“At the moment there’s been no discussion. I have had a long-standing relationship with Qatar because of my involvement with PSG … but there’s been no discussion at the moment,” Beckham said, referencing the French club Paris Saint-Germain, where he played at the end of his career around the time the Qatar Sports Investments group bought the team.
During the CNBC interview, Beckham also discussed his various other ventures, including his ongoing business partnership with Authentic Brands CEO Jamie Salter. Authentic Studios, under Authentic Brands was behind the creation of the newly released Netflix docuseries, “Beckham,” which chronicles Beckham’s rise to superstardom and his marriage to Victoria Beckham. Authentic Brands previously took a majority stake in Beckham’s brand management firm, DB Ventures, in 2022.
Beckham’s success at Manchester United is featured prominently in the documentary.
The club has had a tumultuous last few years under the leadership of the American Glazer family, who took control of the Premiere League club in 2005. The team went six years without winning a trophy before it won the English League Cup this year.
In November last year, Manchester United announced star player Cristiano Ronaldo would leave the team following an interview where he criticized manager Erik ten Hag and the Glazer family. Ronaldo spent only one year with the club during his second stint there.
Manchester United is currently ranked 10th in the Premier League and sits at a record of four wins and four losses.
Soccer club Inter Miami, of which Beckham is part owner, signed a landmark deal with soccer superstar Lionel Messi earlier this year. Managing owner Jorge Mas said in July that he expects the signing to double revenues of the soccer club over the next year."
Melissa Repko,Target CEO meets with Biden as company tries to figure out consumers,"In this article
Target
CEO Brian Cornell met with President Joe Biden on Thursday afternoon as the retailer — and the White House — try to figure out U.S. consumers.
Cornell is one of about a half-dozen business leaders across industries who offered up their point of view on the economy and the labor market at the White House. Other attendees at the meeting with Biden were expected to include Brendan Bechtel, CEO of construction and engineering firm Bechtel Group; Calvin Butler, CEO of energy and utility company Exelon
; Kenneth Chenault, chair and managing director of venture capital firm General Catalyst; Thasunda Brown Duckett, CEO of financial services company TIAA; Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM
; and Judy Marks, CEO of Otis Worldwide, a manufacturer of elevator, escalator and similar equipment, according to the White House.
The CEO huddle was closed to the press.
In a statement, Target said it appreciated the chance to “participate in this important conversation” but provided few specifics about what was discussed.
“While they are incredibly resilient, we know American consumers still face several headwinds that are leaving them with less discretionary income and driving difficult trade-offs in their family budgets,” the statement said.
The company said it’s committed to providing affordable prices for shoppers and attractive pay and benefits for employees.
In a statement after the meeting, the White House said the president and business leaders spoke about economic growth and “underscored the importance of public sector-enabled, private sector-led investments.”
Biden’s meeting with the business leaders comes as the White House gears up for the next presidential election, a time when the president’s track record on the economy and inflation will be under the microscope. Inflation remains stubbornly high — a factor that has cut into consumer spending at Target — but Biden on Thursday cheered new data showing the rate of price increases continues to slow.
For Target, the meeting comes at a pivotal time. The retailer’s business has taken a hit from a tougher economic backdrop and the divisive political climate. It recently announced plans to close nine stores in major American cities, including New York City and San Francisco, blaming the shuttered locations on heightened levels of organized retail crime and concerns about violence.
The big-box retailer cut its full-year forecast in August, saying its shoppers have continued to watch their dollars and spend mostly on necessities even as inflation cools. At the time, Cornell cited other factors that could hurt sales in the coming months and during the critical holiday season, including higher interest rates and the return of student loan payments.
Target also got caught in the crosshairs of conservative political furor over its Pride month merchandise. It has had a collection of LGBTQ-themed items for more than a decade, but the merchandise drew backlash this year. The company removed some items, citing concerns about employee and customer safety.
In August, Cornell said on an earnings call that the “negative reaction” contributed to the company missing Wall Street’s sales expectations for the most recent quarter.
It’s not the first time the Target CEO has had an important meeting at the White House. During the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, he joined Walmart
CEO Doug McMillon and other top executives at a news conference in the Rose Garden with then-President Donald Trump and pledged to help ramp up access to Covid testing.

Sarah Whitten,Hollywood stuck in a rut after talks break down between actors’ union and studios,"Forget about a Hollywood ending for actors and studios — for now.
After just under two weeks, negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke down Wednesday night.
It appears that wages and artificial intelligence protections remain sticking points between actors and studios.
The AMPTP claims that SAG-AFTRA’s offer would cost more than $800 million per year, a sum that studios said would “create an untenable economic burden.” SAG-AFTRA’s negotiating team countered on Thursday, accusing studios of using bully tactics to misrepresent the cost of the actor’s proposal, overstating the price by 60%.The two parties have also clashed on what guardrails should and should not be attached to the use of AI.
With the dissolution of talks, the strike will rage on, disrupting marketing campaigns and preventing production from commencing on a significant portion of Hollywood’s film and television projects.
While some talk shows, like those of late-night heavyweights Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver, returned following the WGA deal, most scripted programs remain dark. Some independent productions have managed to continue by agreeing to SAG-AFTRA’s interim agreement.
If negotiations do not continue or become resolved soon, more theatrical film release dates will be delayed, disrupting the box office, and television releases will be pushed.
Hollywood and industry observers had hoped negotiations would move quickly in the wake of the Writers Guild of America’s deal with the AMPTP last month. Writers officially ratified the new contract earlier this week.
But Wednesday’s bad turn dashed those hopes.
“After meaningful conversations, it is clear that the gap between the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA is too great, and conversations are no longer moving us in a productive direction,” the AMPTP said in a statement Wednesday.
Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA’s negotiators claim that the proposal from AMPTP was “shockingly, worth less than they proposed before the strike began.”
“These companies refuse to protect performers from being replaced by AI, they refuse to increase your wages to keep up with inflation, and they refuse to share a tiny portion of the immense revenue your work generates for them,” SAG-AFTRA negotiators wrote in a letter to striking actors.
The AMPTP said common issues, like general wage increases, SVOD residuals and viewership bonuses, were the same terms ratified by the Directors Guild of America and the WGA.
The WGA secured pay increases in each of the next three years, artificial intelligence restrictions and a new residual system for streaming based on viewership. The guild also negotiated higher contribution rates to health benefits and pensions, as well as a guaranteed number of writers in writers’ rooms for television shows.
SAG-AFTRA is looking to improve wages, working conditions and health and pension benefits, as well as establish guardrails for the use of AI in future television and film productions. Additionally, the union is seeking more transparency from streaming services about viewership so that residual payments can be made equitable to linear TV. The guild is also looking to standardize the self-tape process.

The company initially targeted consumer customers, and now says Starlink has upward of two million subscribers. It has expanded into other markets — including national security, enterprise, mobility, maritime and aviation — and disrupted the existing satellite communications sector.
Maersk said its deal with SpaceX came after a successful pilot phase with more than 30 of the company’s ships, during which crew members gave “very positive feedback” about the service."
Annika Kim Constantino,Incoming Walgreens CEO doesn’t mention walkouts as he praises pharmacy staff,"In this article
Incoming Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth on Thursday briefly praised the company’s pharmacy staff, but made no mention of the three-day protest walkouts they held this week over poor working conditions.
The walkouts reflect rising dissatisfaction among pharmacy employees, who have complained for years about having to grapple with understaffing and burdensome work expectations imposed by corporate management. The Covid-19 pandemic worsened those issues, with new duties such as testing and vaccinations stretching employees even thinner. 
The growing labor pressure is just one of several challenges Wentworth will have to face when he steps into the chief executive role on Oct. 23.
He will also have to grapple with a profit squeeze due to falling demand for Covid products and Walgreens’ rocky transition from being a major drugstore chain to a large health-care company. 
Wentworth, during the company’s earnings call Thursday, shared a story about how an employee at a store in Rochester, New York, “professionally and cheerfully” helped deliver a critical medication prescription for his mother. 
“It was the kind of experience I appreciate and everyone deserves,” Wentworth said in his first remarks as incoming CEO since Walgreens announced his appointment on Tuesday. 
He said committed pharmacists and other team members can collectively “improve the lives of each person who walks through our door in my mom’s hometown Walgreens in Rochester, and in every store we operate.” 
The experiences he has had with employees made his decision to join Walgreens “frankly, an easy one,” Wentworth added.
His remarks partly echoed a statement the company issued earlier this week in response to the walkouts. 
A Walgreens spokesperson touted the company’s pharmacy teams in the statement, noting that they work “tirelessly to serve our communities.”
But the spokesperson also acknowledged that the “last few years have required an unprecedented effort from our team members.” 
Walgreens is engaged and listening to the concerns of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, the spokesperson said.
But it’s unclear whether management has made any changes in response to any of those employees’ demands, which include more staff, payroll transparency, advance notice of staff and schedule changes and mandatory training for new hires, among other items. 
In addition to filling and verifying prescriptions, pharmacy employees often have to juggle patient phone calls, administer a growing number of vaccines this fall, work with insurance companies on issues such as copays and reimbursements, perform rapid Covid and flu testing and deal with angry customers who are seeing longer wait times due to understaffing."
Michael Sheetz,"Viasat won’t replace damaged Americas satellite, moves up financial targets","In this article
Viasat
shares rose Thursday after the company said it expects to meet financial growth targets earlier than expected and that it won’t need to replace a damaged $750 million communications satellite.
While Viasat’s investigation into the root cause of the ViaSat-3 Americas satellite malfunction is still ongoing, the company said its current and imminent satellite fleet, as well as support from third parties, “will meet the current and future needs” of its key mobility market customers despite the lost bandwidth.
The company “is well-positioned to achieve its financial growth objectives” despite the problem. Viasat expects to be free cash flow positive in the first half of 2025, earlier than the second half of 2025 it previously forecast.
Viasat stock rose 7.5% in trading to close at $16.80 a share.

The company in July disclosed the malfunction with the recently launched ViaSat-3 Americas satellite, also known as ViaSat-3 F1, that occurred while deploying the reflector of the spacecraft’s antenna. On Thursday, Viasat said it “expects to recover less than 10% of the planned” communications capability of the satellite.
The company also expects to finalize a $420 million insurance claim on the ViaSat-3 Americas satellite before the end of the year, representing just over half the company’s value.
Separately, Viasat on Thursday confirmed it plans to make a $348 million insurance claim before the end of the year for the I6 F2 backup satellite. The company in August reported that I6 F2′s power system malfunctioned.
Together, the pair of Viasat insurance claims total $768 million, which industry executives previously expected would roil the specialty space insurance market."
Drew Richardson,AMC CEO identified as victim of an online blackmail attempt last year,"In this article
AMC
CEO Adam Aron confirmed Thursday he was the victim of a blackmail attempt by a New York woman last year.
The case had been previously publicized, identifying the victim in legal documents only as a CEO of a publicly traded company. News outlet Semafor reported Thursday that Aron was the unnamed CEO, which he later confirmed in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Unfortunately, last year I became the victim of an elaborate criminal extortion by a third party who was unknown to me related to false allegations about my personal life,” Aron said.
“Rather than give in to blackmail, I personally engaged counsel and other professional advisors and reported the matter to law enforcement,” he said. “I did so knowing I risked personal embarrassment. But with my access to resources, if I did not stand up against blackmail, who could?”
The New York woman behind the blackmail attempt, Sakoya Blackwood, pretended to be a former romantic partner of Aron using an anonymous online account beginning in March 2022. She then attempted to extort Aron of $300,000, threatening to expose Aron’s online behavior to the AMC board.
Blackwood was charged in a Manhattan federal court for her extortion attempts and was sentenced in July to time already served in jail.
Aron said Thursday he was asked by law enforcement to keep the matter confidential during the investigation and legal proceedings, and that he informed AMC’s board after Blackwood’s sentencing.
“This indeed was entirely a personal matter, and the matter is closed,” Aron said."
Leslie Josephs,Delta Air Lines profit jumps almost 60% after strong summer,"In this article
Delta Air Lines’
profit rose nearly 60% in the third quarter as strong travel demand continued through the summer, particularly for international trips, though the carrier forecast full-year earnings toward the low end of an earlier estimate after a jump in fuel prices.
In its quarterly report Thursday, Delta said it expects adjusted, full-year earnings of $6 to $6.25 a share, after forecasting $6 to $7 a share in July. Delta cut its free cash flow estimate for the year to $2 billion from the $3 billion it forecast in the summer.
Delta said that it expects solid travel demand in the last three months of the year, estimating revenue will rise 9% to 12% from the same quarter of 2022, with per-share earnings of $1.05 to $1.30, in line with estimates.
“We expect many of the same trends to continue in the fourth quarter,” CEO Ed Bastian said in a CNBC interview.
Delta and other airlines trimmed their third-quarter forecasts in recent weeks because of a surge in fuel prices.
“Obviously there’s some short-term pressure on fuel as fuel rose quickly in the third quarter and stayed relatively high into the fourth quarter,” Bastian noted.
Here’s how Delta performed in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with Wall Street expectations based on consensus estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
Delta brought in adjusted revenue of nearly $14.6 billion for the period, up 13% year over year and in line with analysts’ expectations.
Net income for the period was $1.11 billion, or $1.72 per share, up 59% from $695 million, or $1.08 per share, during the same period a year earlier. Adjusted for third-party refinery sales and other items, the company earned $2.03 during the quarter.
Delta and other global airlines have cited particularly strong demand for trips abroad, with trans-Atlantic travel a standout. The Atlanta-based carrier reported revenue for those flights was up 34% in the third quarter compared with last year.
Delta’s planes flew 88% full in the quarter, up 1 percentage point from the year-earlier period, despite additional capacity both domestically and internationally. Unit revenue from passengers fell 1.5%, year over year. Airfares have dropped in recent months as airlines grew their schedules.
In addition to a surge in international trips, the carrier has said it has seen a sharp increase in demand for premium seats, like business class or premium economy. Main cabin revenue came in at $6.62 billion, up 12% on the year, while premium product sales rose 17% to $5.11 billion, Delta said.
“I know the lower-fare airlines are having some challenges but our premium product, especially domestically is doing very, very well,” Bastian said in the interview. He added that business travel is more than 80% recovered to 2019 levels.
However, Delta President Glen Hauenstein said Thursday on an earnings call that the Hollywood and autoworkers strikes have hurt demand from those sectors.
Delta has a more than 70% market share in Detroit and nearly 20% at Los Angeles International Airport, the most of any carrier.
Delta came under fire from customers last month when it announced it would make it harder to earn elite frequent flyer status and said it will scale back access to its popular airport lounges after travelers experienced long entry lines. Weeks later, Bastian said the carrier would make changes to those new policies, which he said might have gone “too far.”
Bastian declined to provide details but said changes could be announced in the “coming days.”
“Customers almost universally understand we had to do something given the significant demand for our premium assets,” he said.
United Airlines
and American Airlines
are scheduled to report third-quarter results next week."
Michael Wayland,UAW launches strike against Ford’s Kentucky truck plant as dispute escalates,"In this article
DETROIT — The United Auto Workers union launched an unexpected strike against Ford Motor
at the automaker’s highly profitable SUV and pickup truck plant in Kentucky.
The strike was effective at 6:30 p.m. ET Wednesday at Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant, where the automaker produces Ford Super Duty pickups as well as the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator SUVs. The facility employs 8,700 UAW members.
The strike at the plant — Ford’s largest in terms of employment and revenue — marks a major escalation in the UAW’s targeted, or “stand-up,” strikes. It also represents a shift in strategy now in the fourth week of expanded strikes. For previous work strikes, UAW President Shawn Fain has publicly announced the targets before the work stoppages occur.
A Ford source said the union informed the company early Wednesday afternoon that it wanted a new economic counteroffer by 5 p.m. ET, followed by a meeting request for 5:30 p.m. ET with the UAW’s entire Ford bargaining committee, including Fain and union Vice President Chuck Browning.
The source, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private, said the meeting lasted less than 10 minutes before Fain declared that the company had “lost Kentucky Truck.”
“The strike was called after Ford refused to make further movement in bargaining,” the union said in a release. “The surprise move marks a new phase in the UAW’s Stand Up Strike.”
A UAW source with knowledge of the talks said Ford did not add any additional cash to its proposed deal, which provoked the strike escalation. The source added the union was expecting Ford to enhance its prior economic offer.
Ford said the “decision by the UAW to call a strike at Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant is grossly irresponsible but unsurprising given the union leadership’s stated strategy of keeping the Detroit 3 wounded for months through ‘reputational damage’ and ‘industrial chaos.’” 
The latter part of the statement refers to leaked private messages last month in which UAW communications director Jonah Furman discussed the union’s public posturing of issues and targeted strikes as causing “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” to the automakers.
The companies have argued the messages, as well as the union’s actions, show UAW negotiators were never actually interested in reaching a deal with the Detroit automakers.
“We have been crystal clear, and we have waited long enough, but Ford has not gotten the message,” Fain said in a statement Wednesday. “It’s time for a fair contract at Ford and the rest of the Big Three. If they can’t understand that after four weeks, the 8,700 workers shutting down this extremely profitable plant will help them understand it.”
Ford said the new strike puts at risk approximately a dozen additional operations at the automaker and “many more supplier operations that together employ well over 100,000 people.”
Ford said it had presented an “outstanding offer” and “has been bargaining in good faith this week on joint venture battery plants,” which have been a recent focus of the talks.
General Motors last week agreed to include workers at its electric vehicle battery plant in the company’s national contract with the union, which Fain called a “transformative win.”
Fain said the union expects Chrysler parent Stellantis and Ford to follow suit, including battery plant workers in eventual contract agreements.
The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14.
The additional workers brings UAW’s total to about 34,000 U.S. workers, or roughly 23% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, who are currently on strike.
Fain will give bargaining updates and potentially announce further strikes at 10 a.m. Friday online, the union said Wednesday night."
Annika Kim Constantino,"Walgreens stock rises as cost cuts make progress, even as profit outlook comes up short","In this article
Walgreens
on Thursday offered soft profit guidance and reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations, as demand for Covid vaccines and tests sinks in the U.S. 
The retail pharmacy giant – squeezed by the transition out of the Covid pandemic, a leadership shake-up, its wobbly push into health-care and recent labor pressure from pharmacy staff – has now underperformed Wall Street’s adjusted earnings expectations for two straight quarters. The last time Walgreens posted a consecutive earnings miss was nearly a decade ago.
Still, Walgreens reported narrower losses and progress in its cost-cutting plans. It also posted sales growth in its health care business, which is now central to the company’s business strategy. Shares of Walgreens closed 7% higher on Thursday. The stock had been down more than 39% for the year heading into the open. 
The quarterly results came two days after Walgreens named health-care industry veteran Tim Wentworth as its new CEO following the abrupt departure of the company’s former top executive, Roz Brewer, last month. Wentworth, who will take over on Oct. 23, is tasked with steering the retail pharmacy giant out of a rough spot. 
“I have worked with Walgreens as a customer partner, competitor investor and family member, and I understand the challenges ahead for us,” Wentworth, the former CEO of Cigna
’s pharmacy benefits management company, said during the earnings call Thursday.
Wentworth also praised the company’s pharmacy staff, sharing a brief story about how an employee at a New York location helped fill his mother’s prescription for critical medications. However, he made no mention of the three-day walkouts that pharmacists and pharmacy technicians held this week to protest chronic understaffing and other poor working conditions.
The company said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.20 to $3.50 in the coming fiscal year, which is lower than analysts’ estimate of $3.72. Walgreens expects lower Covid-related sales, along with a higher tax rate and lower sale and leaseback contributions, to offset earnings growth. 
Walgreens also sees revenue for the year at $141 billion to $145 billion. Wall Street analysts estimated sales of more than $144 billion.
“We see a continuation of the challenging trends that impacted us in 2023,” interim CFO Manmohan Mahajan said during an earnings call Thursday, noting that the company is “adopting a prudent approach.”
Mahajan added that Walgreens expects to see a higher level of shrink, or lost inventory, in the upcoming fiscal year, which has been increasing for the company over the last several months and continues to represent a serious systemic issue across the retail industry.
But Interim CEO Ginger Graham noted during the call that the company expects over $1 billion in savings during the next fiscal year due to its ongoing cost-cutting initiative, which involves closing unprofitable stores and using AI to drive supply chain efficiencies, among other efforts.
Here’s what Walgreens reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
The company reported a net loss of $180 million, or 21 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That compares with a net loss of $415 million, or 48 cents per share, during the same period a year ago. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per share were 67 cents for the quarter. 
Mahajan said the loss was driven by charges for certain legal and regulatory approvals and settlements, and one-time charges related to Walgreens’ cost-cutting program.
Walgreens booked sales of $35.42 billion in the quarter, which is up roughly 9% from the same period a year ago due to growth in its U.S. retail pharmacy and international business segments. 
Sales in the company’s U.S. health-care division also grew. Walgreens noted in a release that it is “intently focused on accelerating” that segment’s profitability moving forward. 
Walgreens has made significant investments to transform from a major drugstore chain to a large health-care company.
But the pharmacy chain is facing a number of challenges in that transition, including a profit squeeze due to softer consumer spending and declining demand for Covid products as patients emerge from the pandemic. Walgreens is also facing an open revolt among pharmacists and pharmacy technicians demanding better working conditions.
Walgreens’ U.S. retail pharmacy segment generated $27.66 billion in sales in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 3.7% from the same period last year. Comparable sales at individual locations rose 5.7%. 
Pharmacy sales for the quarter increased 6.4% compared with the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, with comparable sales up more than 9% due to price inflation in brand medications and mix impacts.
Total prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, decreased by 0.5% to 297 million. Walgreens cited a weaker respiratory virus season this fall, which is blunting demand for medications and vaccines. 
The company administered roughly 400,000 Covid vaccines in the quarter, down from 2.9 million during the same period last year, according to Mahajan.
Retail sales for the quarter decreased 4.3% compared with the same period a year ago, and comparable retail sales fell 3.3%. 
Mahajan said retail revenue was impacted by a decline in demand for over-the-counter Covid tests, weaker cough, cold and flu sales and softer consumer spending. He added that elevated shrink negatively affected sales for health and wellness and personal care and beauty products.
Meanwhile, the company’s international segment racked up $5.78 billion in sales in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is up more than 12% from the same period a year ago. 
Mahajan said that reflects growth across all international markets, with sales from the company’s U.K. subsidiary, Boots, growing nearly 11%.
Sales in Walgreens’ U.S. health-care segment came in at $1.97 billion, up from $622 million for the same period last year. Its operating loss narrowed to $294 million from $338 million.
Primary-care provider VillageMD, which includes urgent-care provider Summit Health, saw revenue grow by 17%. Walgreens said that reflects “existing clinic growth and clinic footprint expansion” of VillageMD, which has a network of hundreds of full-service doctors offices across the U.S. 
Sales at CareCentrix, which coordinates home care for patients after they’re discharged from the hospital, increased 24% due to additional service offerings and expansion into additional markets. 
The health-care segment took a loss of $30 million in the quarter before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared to a loss of $133 million during the same period a year ago.
Walgreens said that “improvement” was driven by growth at CareCentrix and Shields Health Solutions, a specialty pharmacy company included in the health care segment. 
But John Driscoll, president of the U.S. health-care business, said that the company is “not satisfied with the near-term return on our investments” in the segment.
“We will continue to grow in 2024 but with a renewed focus on more profitable growth,” he said during the earnings call.

Amelia Lucas,Chipotle plans ‘modest’ menu price increases after pausing hikes this year,"In this article
Chipotle Mexican Grill
is planning to raise prices again.
“For the first time in over a year, we will be taking a modest price increase to offset inflation,” Chipotle Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Laurie Schalow said in a statement to CNBC.
The company did not share how much menu prices will rise as a result of the decision.
After peaking last June, inflation has cooled. Prices for many goods and services are still rising but at a slower rate. The 12-month consumer price index rose 3.7% in August after climbing 8.3% a year earlier, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The burrito chain started hiking its menu prices in June 2021, citing the cost of rising wages for its employees. It raised its prices again during the first three months of 2022 and then again in July of that year.
But Chipotle paused its price hikes as some customers pulled back on restaurant spending and ingredient costs stabilized. In April, CEO Brian Niccol said the chain had demonstrated its pricing power but would hold off on raising prices any more. At that time, its prices were up roughly 10% compared to the year-ago period.
Three months later, Niccol said Chipotle would reconsider its pricing as the company’s fourth quarter drew closer.
Chipotle’s stock has risen 30% this year, giving it a market value of $50.1 billion. The company is expected to report its third-quarter earnings Oct. 26.
Insider first reported that Chipotle’s prices are going up again."
Gabrielle Fonrouge,Birkenstock slides 12% in stock market debut after opening at $41 a share,"In this article
Shares of Birkenstock
slid more than 12% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
The German shoe brand’s stock closed at $40.20 per share, down from its opening trade of $41 per share, giving it a market value of $7.55 billion. The stock’s opening price came in lower than its initial price of $46 set Tuesday, which was just shy of the midpoint of its expected range of $44 to $49 per share.
Birkenstock sold 10.75 million ordinary shares in the offering, raising about $495 million and initially valuing the company at about $8.64 billion. Birkenstock had originally sought a valuation of up to $9.2 billion.
The company’s market debut comes nearly 250 years after it was founded by German cobbler Johann Adam Birkenstock. It remained under family control until 2021 when private equity powerhouse L Catterton acquired a majority stake in a deal that valued the business at $4.85 billion. 
In an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” Birkenstock CEO Oliver Reichert explained why the company decided to go public.
“The best thing for the brand would be staying family owned, but within the family there were so many problems, so we go for the second best option and that’s to be public and give the brand back to the people,” said Reichert.
Since L Catterton acquired its stake, sales have grown and Birkenstock’s valuation has nearly doubled. Between fiscal 2020 and 2022, sales jumped from 728 million euros ($771 million) to 1.24 billion euros. Over that time, the company grew direct-to-consumer sales, strategically exited certain wholesale partnerships and focused on driving sales of items with higher price points.
It posted net income of about 187 million euros in fiscal 2022 and saw margins of about 60%. Birkenstock has room to grow those margins if it expands its direct-to-consumer sales, which have grown from 18% of sales in fiscal 2018 to 38% in fiscal 2022, it said in a securities filing.
The offering comes as the IPO market gradually begins to defrost after more than a year of stagnation. But it has remained choppy and uncertain. Multiple recent IPO filers did well in their first couple of days of trading, but those stocks have since fallen.
Instacart priced its long-awaited IPO at $30 per share last month. But after an initial 40% pop, it closed at $33.70 on its first day on the Nasdaq and is now trading below its opening share price. Oddity Tech
, another L Catterton-backed consumer company, debuted on the public markets in July with a 35% pop and saw its stock close at $47.53 after the first day of trading. Soon after, it reached a high of $56 per share but since then, Oddity’s stock has fallen and is now trading below its initial offering price of $35.
A similar trend has followed Johnson & Johnson spinoff Kenvue.
The footwear and apparel sectors have been under pressure this year as consumers shift their spending from goods to services. But Birkenstock’s growth, sustained profitability and cultural relevance after its recent cameo in the “Barbie” movie have sparked interest from investors.
“Birkenstock is a long-standing brand but it fits into the trend of embracing casual comfort in the workplace after COVID. It continues to grow even in the face of a declining global footwear market, as consumers allocate their disposable income to other interests, such as travel,” Alex Smith, global sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, said in an emailed note.
“The current growth is being driven by a younger, new consumer base and its rising popularity among celebrities – even Barbie has been spotted wearing Arizona sandals.”
Despite its long history, Smith noted Birkenstock still has room to grow. Its customer base is still primarily female customers because of its sizing options and manufacturing capabilities, and it could expand sales outside of the U.S. and Europe."
Hugh Son,Goldman Sachs warns of hit to third-quarter earnings on deal to offload GreenSky,"In this article
Goldman Sachs
said Wednesday that it agreed to sell its fintech lending platform GreenSky to a group of investors led by private equity firm Sixth Street.
The deal, which includes a book of loans created by Goldman, will result in a 19 cents per share reduction to third-quarter earnings, Goldman said in the statement. The New York-based bank is scheduled to disclose results Tuesday.
The move is the latest step CEO David Solomon has taken to retrench from his ill-fated push into retail banking. Under Solomon’s direction, Goldman acquired GreenSky last year for $1.7 billion, overruling deputies who felt the home improvement lender was a poor fit. Months later, Solomon decided to seek bids for the business amid his broader move away from consumer finance. Goldman also sold a wealth management business and was reportedly in talks to offload its Apple Card operations.
“This transaction demonstrates our continued progress in narrowing the focus of our consumer business,” Solomon said in the release.
The bank is now focused on its core strengths in investment banking and trading and its push to grow asset and wealth management fees, he added.
Goldman will continue to operate GreenSky until the sale closes in the first quarter of 2024, the bank said.
The expected hit to third-quarter earnings includes expenses tied to a write down of GreenSky intangibles, as well as marks on the loan portfolio and higher taxes, offset by the release of loan reserves tied to the transaction, Goldman said.
It follows a $504 million second-quarter impairment on GreenSky disclosed in July.
The Sixth Street group includes funds managed by KKR, Bayview Asset Management and CardWorks, according to the release.
Private equity groups have played key roles in several of the banking industry’s asset divestitures since the start of the year, providing funding for the PacWest merger with Banc of California, for example.

Hugh Son,These regional banks are at risk of being booted from the S&P 500,"In this article
The stock sell-off
that hit regional banks this year has exposed lenders including Zions
and Comerica
to the risk of being delisted from the Standard & Poor’s 500 index.
The banks, each with market capitalizations of around $5 billion, were the fourth- and sixth-smallest members of the 500 company listing as of this week, according to FactSet.
That leaves the companies in a similar position to Lincoln National,
which got shunted from the S&P 500 last month and placed into a small-cap index. Blackstone,
the world’s largest alternative asset manager, took Lincoln National’s spot.
This year’s regional banking crisis has already caused changes in the composition of the S&P 500, the most popular broad measure of large American companies in the investing world. Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic were removed from the benchmark after deposit runs led to their government seizure. More changes may be coming, especially if the industry faces a protracted slump, according to analysts.
“It’s absolutely a risk,” Chris Marinac, research director at Janney Montgomery Scott, said in an interview. “If the market were to further change the valuation of these companies, especially if we have higher rates, I wouldn’t rule it out.”
Banks begin disclosing third-quarter results Friday, led by JPMorgan Chase
. Investors are keen to hear how rising interest rates affected bond holdings and deposits in the period.
Companies that no longer qualify as large-cap stocks are at heightened risk of demotion from the S&P 500. There were seven members valued at $6 billion or less at the end of August. Two of them were removed the following month: insurer Lincoln National and consumer firm Newell Brands
.
Those that join the benchmark often celebrate the milestone. The popularity of mutual funds and ETFs based on the index means that new members typically see an immediate boost to their stock price. Those that get demoted can suffer declines as fewer money managers need to own shares in the companies.
To be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500, companies need to have a market capitalization of at least $14.5 billion and meet profitability and trading standards.
Members that violate “one or more of the eligibility criteria for the S&P Composite 1500 may be deleted from the respective component index at the Index Committee’s discretion,” according to S&P Dow Jones Indices’ methodology.
Still, that doesn’t mean Zions or Comerica are on the cusp of a delisting. The committee that decides the composition of the S&P 500 looks to minimize churn and accurately represent reference sectors, making changes only when “ongoing conditions warrant an index change,” according to S&P.
For instance, after the onset of the Covid pandemic in March 2020, many retail S&P 500 companies temporarily violated the profitability rule, but that didn’t result in widespread demotions, according to a person who has studied the S&P 500 index.
S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment for this article, as did Comerica. Zion’s didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.
Besides Zions and Comerica, KeyCorp
and Citizens Financial
are the only other S&P 500 banks with market caps below the threshold for inclusion in the index, according to an Aug. 31 Piper Sandler note. KeyCorp and Citizens, however, each have market caps of greater than $10 billion, making them less likely to be impacted than smaller banks.
After Blackstone became the first major alternative asset manager to join the S&P 500 last month, analysts said that peers including KKR
and Apollo Global
may be next, and they would likely replace other financial names. KKR and Apollo each have market capitalizations of greater than $50 billion.
“Perhaps more demotions of low-market cap financials are to come,” Wells Fargo analyst Finian O’Shea said in a Sept. 5 research note.

Laya Neelakandan,Disney World and Disneyland raise prices for passes and tickets,"In this article
It’s about to get a bit more expensive to experience the magic of Walt Disney World and Disneyland.
The parks are increasing a wide variety of prices for passes, effective immediately, including parking and annual passes.
The parks’ most basic tickets, date-based day passes, will remain unchanged and vary based on the busyness of the date. At Disneyland, that least expensive option will run you $104 — consistent since before the pandemic — and at Disney World it’ll cost $109.
At Disney World in Orlando, annual price passes jumped by nearly 10%, with the most expensive Incredi-Pass now selling for $1,449.
Parking at the theme park will also rise by $5 to $30 total, but it’s free for hotel guests. And beginning Jan. 9, “Park Hopper” tickets will return, allowing vacationers to travel between parks at any time of day.
At Disneyland in Anaheim, the highest daily pass increased to $194, a nearly 9% increase from earlier prices. The cost of the Magic Key pass and Genie+ add-ons also jumped.
Parking at the California park will also see higher pricing.
“We are constantly adding new, innovative attractions and entertainment to our parks and, with our broad array of pricing options, the value of a theme park visit is reflected in the unique experiences that only Disney can offer,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement.
The price hikes come a week after Disney announced promotions for child tickets as low as $50 as theme parks report a slowdown in attendance.
Disney recently said it plans to nearly double its investment in its park division as it emerges from shutdowns that devastated the industry during the pandemic.
“As Disney considers future growth opportunities, there is a deep well of stories that have yet to be fully explored in its theme parks,” the company said in a September presentation.
Clarification: This story was updated to specify how the price increases affect admission at each park."

That caused a run on these so-called ARMs, pushing total mortgage application volume very slightly higher, up 0.6% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 7.67% from 7.53%, for loans with a 20% down payment. But the average contract interest rate for 5/1 ARMs decreased to 6.33% from 6.49%.
ARMs usually offer much lower rates because they have shorter fixed terms. The difference between ARM rates and the 30-year fixed rate, however, has been unusually narrow recently. Last week, it widened.
“The level of ARM applications increased by 15% over the week, bringing the ARM share up to 9.2% of all applications, the highest share since November 2022,” wrote Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist, in a release. “The yield curve has become less inverted in recent weeks and ARM pricing has certainly improved.”
Applications to refinance a home loan inched up 0.3% from the previous week and were 9% lower than the same week one year ago.
Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 1% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week one year ago.
“Application activity remains depressed and close to multi-decade lows, with purchase applications still almost 20% behind last year’s pace,” added Kan.
The average loan size is now at its lowest level since 2017. This indicates that most of the sales activity is happening at the lower end of the market. At the very high end, buyers tend to use all cash, and in the middle range affordability has been hit so hard that the market is essentially frozen.
At an open house in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, there were plenty of potential buyers looking, but most said that was all they were doing: just looking. The house was priced at $1.54 million.
“In this first two weeks of October, as anticipated, inventories have taken a jump, but then because interest rates have taken a jump too, we’re seeing less buyers. Lots of traffic, but not a lot of actual shoppers,” said Lisa Resch, a real estate agent with Compass who listed the home."
John Rosevear,ChargePoint shares fall after EV charging operator announces $232 million raise,"In this article
Shares of EV charging network operator ChargePoint Holdings
closed sharply lower Wednesday after the company said it’s raising $232 million via stock sales.
The company’s stock was down over 15% at Wednesday’s market close.
ChargePoint said in a statement that a group of institutional investors has agreed to purchase $175 million in newly issued stock. The company also disclosed it has raised $57 million during the current fiscal quarter via its existing “at-the-market” stock offering facility, for a total of $232 million in new funds.
CFO Rex Jackson said in a statement that the new funds, together with a recently secured credit line, will support the company into early 2025.
“These raises and our recently announced $150M revolving credit facility are consistent with our announced capital strategy to bolster our balance sheet,” Jackson said, adding the company has no further plans to offer stock via its at-the-market facility.
ChargePoint also disclosed that it has altered the terms of a prior $300 million convertible notes deal to give the company another year to pay back the funding but straps it with higher interest payments.
ChargePoint’s shares closed at $4.49 on Tuesday, down about 53% since the beginning of 2023."
Cait Freda,Period care brands form coalition to fight the ‘tampon tax’,"Starting Wednesday, consumers paying state sales tax on menstrual products will be able to get those costs on some period care purchases reimbursed.
The Tampon Tax Back Coalition — an initiative of period care brands August, Cora, LOLA, The Honey Pot, Rael, Here We Flo, Saalt and DIVA — will reimburse consumers for the tax paid on eligible items sold by the eight participating brands.
The coalition aims to stop the “tampon tax,” a term used to describe the state sales tax imposed on products such as tampons, pads and menstrual cups in more than a dozen U.S. states. Many states exempt essential products such as food and medications from being subject to sales tax but leave out period care products, because their current state tax codes consider them nonessential goods.
“So much of the work that has to be done is changing public opinion, putting that public pressure on legislators,” said Nadya Okamoto, co-founder of August, an inclusive period care brand focusing on providing products for all menstruators, not just those who identify as female. “We’ve made some progress, but there’s still quite a bit of ways to go.”
Twenty-one states in the U.S. tax menstrual items at “standard rates,” meaning tampons and pads are taxed at the same rate as any other nonessential product you would pick up at your local retailer, according to data from the Alliance for Period Supplies.
The annual cost of the taxes to consumers totals roughly $80 million, according to Period Law, a group recruiting volunteer attorneys to help advance period equity legislation.
The Tampon Tax Back Coalition was born out of an initiative by August that launched in May. Now with seven additional brands on board, the coalition said it is prioritizing the customer and making the reimbursement process easier.
“This is something that shouldn’t exist,” Okamoto said. “A customer shouldn’t have to text multiple different places or figure out the logistics of how they get the ‘tampon tax’ back if they’re buying one brand of tampons, one brand pads.”
Yanghee Paik, CEO of Rael, a clean feminine care and skincare startup, called the coalition a “big step” toward sending a message that period care products are essential to covering “basic medical needs.”
“Not many people really have the awareness of this issue in the country,” said Paik, adding the tax is “very, very backward.”
Beatrice Dixon, CEO at The Honey Pot, said it was not until she started her own period care brand that she learned about the tampon tax: “Before that, I didn’t even know that I as a consumer was even paying that.” 
Dixon described the decision to get involved in the coalition as a “no-brainer.”
To get reimbursed, customers can visit the coalition’s website and start a claim for reimbursement within 10 days of the date of purchase for eligible items sold by the eight participating brands. Customers will be refunded via Venmo or PayPal within 24 hours of their submissions, according to the coalition."
Michael Wayland,"Stellantis, Samsung SDI to build $3.2 billion EV battery plant in Indiana","In this article
DETROIT — Samsung SDI
and automaker Stellantis
plan to invest more than $3.2 billion in a new electric vehicle battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana.
The facility — Stellantis’ sixth battery plant announced globally — was largely expected, but the location and timing are notable. The announcement Wednesday was made during contentious U.S. labor strikes and contract negotiations between Stellantis and the United Auto Workers union, led by UAW President Shawn Fain, who is from Kokomo.
Battery plants have become a main issue in the labor talks, as the UAW views EV battery jobs as crucial to its long-term viability. General Motors
last week agreed to include workers at its EV battery plant in the company’s national contract with the union, which Fain called a “transformative win.”
Fain said the union expects Stellantis and Ford Motor
to follow suit, including battery plant workers in eventual contract agreements.
“The plan was to draw down engine and transmission plants and permanently replace them with low-wage battery jobs,” Fain said Friday. “We had a different plan, and our plan is winning at GM. And we expect it to win at Ford and Stellantis as well.”
Stellantis declined to comment on details of the ongoing negotiations or timing of the announcement.
EV battery plants are key to the automaker’s plans to build models such as electric versions of its Ram pickup truck and Dodge muscle car.
The new Stellantis battery plant is the second to be planned in Kokomo through a joint venture between the automaker and Samsung SDI called StarPlus Energy. The two plants are expected to create 2,800 new jobs, according to the company.
The first facility, a $2.5 billion plant, is under construction. It’s scheduled to begin production during the first quarter of 2025. The second plant is expected to begin production of battery cells in early 2027.
“Our battery ecosystem is the foundation of our electrification strategy and our great partners Samsung SDI, the State of Indiana, and the City of Kokomo have created a compelling case for locating our sixth gigafactory in Kokomo,” Mark Stewart, Stellantis COO North America, said in a statement."
Bertha Coombs,Walgreens names veteran health-care executive Tim Wentworth as next CEO,"In this article
Walgreens Boots Alliance
has chosen veteran health care executive Tim Wentworth as the company’s new chief executive.
Wentworth is the former CEO of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits management company, Express Scripts, which was acquired by Cigna
in 2018. He stayed on and served as chief of Cigna’s health services, before retiring at the of 2021.
“What made me decide to come back was a chance to lead this iconic brand and company at a time when it’s not in a steady state,” Wentworth told CNBC. “It’s a massive platform... they touch almost 10 million people a day.”
Wentworth will start on Oct. 23, almost two months after Roz Brewer stepped down as CEO, at a time when the company is facing a number of challenges in trying to transition to becoming a provider of health services beyond the pharmacy counter.
Under Brewer’s tenure, Walgreens took a major stake in primary care provider VillageMD, acquired specialty pharmacy provider Shields Health, as well as homecare provider CareCentrix. Trying to integrate and scale the businesses has pressured Walgreens’ earnings.
The transition has come at a time when pharmacy revenue has been pressured by falling demand for Covid vaccines and over-the-counter tests. In June, the company’s third-quarter profits missed Wall Street estimates for the first time in three years.
Walgreens’ board has said they were intent on hiring an executive with deep health experience who could rein in all of the new services.
“I came from one of the great efficiency companies at Express Scripts — I mean, we were built to drive out waste from health care and and we looked at everything through that lens. And that has to do by starting with our own cost structure, and there’s no question inside this company that’s every bit as important,” said Wentworth.
Walgreens’ executive chairman Stefano Pessina said Wentworth “is an accomplished and respected leader with profound expertise in the payer and pharmacy space as well as supply chain, IT and Human Resources. We are confident he is the right person to lead WBA’s next phase of growth into a customer-centric healthcare company.”
The company’s core pharmacy business is also facing challenges. This week, pharmacists in several cities have walked off the job to protest understaffing at pharmacies which the non-union workers say endangers patients. 
Wentworth says during Covid the drugstore chains pivoted quickly to become major providers of vaccines and supported patients with information.
“When you’re in a business that’s having to respond that quickly to something that is that unusual. You don’t get it all right. And I have no doubt that the leadership at Walgreens is taking a look and listening to their folks,” he said. “As a leader, I can tell you, there’s nothing that motivates me more than ensuring every employee feels like they’re supported in that mission.”
Walgreens is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. "
Leslie Picker,Birkenstock prices IPO at $46 per share,"In this article
Birkenstock, the longtime German shoe brand known for its comfy and durable styles, priced its IPO at $46 per share on Tuesday, giving it a tentative valuation of about $8.64 billion.
The pricing came in just shy of the midpoint of Birkenstock’s stated range of $44 to $49 per share and gives it a market cap that’s above Crocs
and in line with Swiss shoe brand On Running
.
Birkenstock had originally sought a valuation of up to $9.2 billion.
The company initially expected to sell about 10.75 million ordinary shares in the offering and could raise around $495 million when it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “BIRK.” 
Combined with the 21.51 million in shares its selling stockholders were looking to offload, the offering could bring in around $1.48 billion.
Birkenstock’s offering comes as the IPO market remains choppy after a number of recent filers began trading in muted debuts. 
Instacart
priced its long awaited IPO at $30 per share last month. But after an initial 40% pop, it closed at $33.70 on its first day on the Nasdaq and is now trading below its opening share price. Similar trends have followed Johnson & Johnson spinoff Kenvue
and beauty and wellness firm Oddity Tech
. 
Birkenstock, which has been in the footwear business since 1774, is going public about two years after private equity firm L Catterton took a majority stake in the business at a valuation of $4.85 billion. It decided to go public so it can boost its valuation and gain access to the capital markets, and plans to use proceeds from the offering to pay off loans, according to a securities filing. 
The company’s growth – and the bump in relevancy it received after its recent cameo in the “Barbie” movie – has attracted interest from investors, even as the footwear sector faces pressure from a slowdown in consumer spending and a shift to services over goods.
Between fiscal 2020 and 2022, sales jumped from 728 million euros ($771 million) to 1.24 billion euros ($1.32 billion) as the company leaned into its direct-to-consumer strategy, exited certain wholesale partnerships in key markets and boosted sales of items with higher price points. 
It posted a net income of about 187 million euros ($198 million) in fiscal 2022. "
Sarah Whitten,Have tickets to the Taylor Swift movie this weekend? Get ready for a dance party,"Take us to church, Taylor.
Starting Friday, Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour film arrives in theaters, and with it comes a certain expectation of exuberance from those in attendance. Friendship bracelet swapping, outfits dripping with shimmery crystals, hands painted with the number 13 and lots of dancing are all part of the concert experience — and expressly encouraged.
Movie theater chains, such as distributor AMC Entertainment
, have told audiences they can sing and dance in the auditoriums, but should refrain from dancing on seats or blocking other guests’ view of the big screen.
Phones, too, are allowed so long as moviegoers don’t record the concert film. So, expect a lot of selfies during the 2 hour and 48 minute event.
“Have the best time, but please be respectful of other guests enjoying the concert film or other movies at AMC,” the company wrote on its website ahead of Friday’s release.
Each cinema has its own rules, so audiences are encouraged to check with their local theater before showing up for their screening. However, it’s expected that most will be lax when it comes to traditional theater etiquette.
The showings are likely to be reminiscent of specialty screenings of films such as “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” where audiences participate in chants and other rituals.
So, get ready to shout “One, two, three, let’s go b----!” at the start of “Delicate” and double clap during the bridge of “You Belong With Me.”
Since Swift announced the theatrical release of her The Eras Tour, ticket sales have soared. AMC reported last week that presales had already exceeded $100 million for its theaters, and expectations are that the film will easily surpass that figure in its opening weekend.
Cinemas have shown taped concerts in the past, but few have driven the fervor for ticket sales like Swift.
The excitement, which has led movie theaters to design specialty popcorn buckets, create boutique cocktails and even set up friendship bracelet-making tables, illustrates there’s a hunger for making something bigger and more memorable out of a trip to the movies.
It’s also likely why a documentary on Beyonce’s “Renaissance” album and tour is coming to theaters in December.
Both Swift and Beyonce’s films are being sold as premium experiences, with higher-priced tickets. The Eras Tour film has ticket prices starting at $13.13 for children and $19.89 for adults, but seats in IMAX, Dolby and other premium formats cost a bit more. Beyonce’s film will see base tickets set at $22 a piece.
For comparison, average adult ticket prices for regular film releases in 2023 have ranged between $11 and $14 apiece for standard formats.
“Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” will play in theaters during the weekends through Nov. 5."
Michael Wayland,GM reaches deal with Canadian autoworkers hours after union initiates strikes,"In this article
DETROIT — General Motors
has reached a tentative agreement for nearly 4,300 Canadian autoworkers after the union representing those workers called a national strike early Tuesday.
Canadian union Unifor said Tuesday afternoon the “strike actions are on hold to allow the membership to vote on the tentative agreement.” A majority of workers must vote in support of the pact for ratification.
Unifor initiated a national strike after the sides failed to reach a deal by an 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline. The strike briefly affected an assembly plant that produces light- and heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado trucks; production of some V6 and V8 engines used in a variety of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox and GM’s full-size SUVs; a stamping facility; and a parts distribution center.
“When faced with the shutdown of these key facilities General Motors had no choice but to get serious at the table and agree to the pattern,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a release.
The Canadian engine plant marked a major concern for the automaker, which also is facing U.S. strikes by the United Auto Workers union. The facility produces engines for highly profitable full-size pickup trucks and SUVS, among other vehicles.
GM, in a statement, confirmed the “record” tentative agreement: “This record agreement, subject to member ratification, recognizes the many contributions of our represented team members with significant increases in wages, benefits and job security while building on GM’s historic investments in Canadian manufacturing.”
Unifor said the tentative deal with GM follows a ratified agreement reached last month with Ford Motor. The agreement, which covers more than 5,600 workers at Ford facilities in Canada, was ratified by 54% of workers who voted. 
The union said the three-year GM deal — like the agreement with Ford — includes hourly wage increases of up to 25%, reactivation of a cost-of-living allowance to battle inflation and a shorter progression for workers to reach top pay, among other new or altered benefits.
Prior to Tuesday, GM and Unifor had been at odds over making temporary workers permanent employees, pension funding and other demands. Payne said all temp workers will become permanent employees by the end of the three-year deal.
“All members will benefit now that the pattern is in place at GM, whether they’re temporary workers, new hires, or already at the top of the pay scale,” said Unifor GM master bargaining chair Jason Gale. “This agreement delivers the kind of historic pay increases our members need and significant pension improvements that will protect their living standards in retirement.” 
GM declined to discuss details of the agreement prior to the union ratification vote. If ratified, Unifor will move onto negotiations with Chrysler-parent Stellantis
, which has the largest footprint of the Detroit automakers in Ontario, Canada.
“I expect Stellantis will come here kicking and screaming the same way General Motors did,” Payne said Tuesday during a news conference.
Unifor, which represents 18,000 Canadian workers at the Detroit automakers, took a more traditional approach to its negotiations than its U.S. counterpart. The Canadian union is negotiating with each automaker separately, using one deal as a “pattern” for each company.
That traditional patterned-bargaining approach runs counter to the UAW’s new strategy of bargaining with all three automakers at once.
The UAW has been gradually increasing the strikes since the work stoppages began after the sides failed to reach tentative agreements by Sept 14. The targeted, or “stand-up,” strikes are taking place instead of national walkouts.
Only 25,200 workers, or roughly 17% of UAW members covered by the expired contracts with the Detroit automakers, are currently on strike."
Amelia Lucas,"PepsiCo beats Wall Street estimates, raises earnings outlook","In this article
PepsiCo
on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations and raised its outlook for its full-year earnings.
Shares of the company rose 2% in premarket trading.
Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
For 2023, Pepsi now expects constant currency earnings per share growth of 13%, up from its prior forecast of 12%. It’s the third consecutive quarter that the snacking and beverage giant has hiked its full-year forecast.
Pepsi reported third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.09 billion, or $2.24 per share, up from $2.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.25 per share.
Net sales rose 6.7% to $23.45 billion. The company’s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 8.8% in the quarter.
But PepsiCo’s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, fell again this quarter. Pepsi’s price hikes to mitigate inflation have weakened demand for its products. The company has also been shrinking portions and making smaller value packs to drive more transactions, Pepsi executives told analysts on a conference call. That strategy results in more affordable options for consumers — and lower volume sold.
Pepsi’s North American beverages unit reported volume declines of 6%. CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has pruned some promotions, such as for its bottled water business, in order to preserve margins. But those deals drove volume for the drinks, gains that disappeared without the promotions.
There were some bright spots in beverages. Gatorade, for example, saw double-digit revenue growth. The company also plans to relaunch Mountain Dew Baja Blast, a fan favorite flavor that is available only at Taco Bell.
The company’s North American food divisions performed better than the beverages unit did. Quaker Foods North America’s volume rose 1%, while Frito-Lay North America’s volume was flat. Quaker Foods’ brands also gained market share in key categories, such as pancake mix and syrup, executives said in prepared remarks.
Looking to 2024, Pepsi anticipates organic revenue growth on the high end of 4% to 6% and core constant currency earnings per share growth in the high single digits."
Courtney Reagan,Nike is supreme among teen shoppers. Here are the other brands they love most,"In this article
Teens are a notoriously fickle bunch — but the group is also often on the leading edge of many trends the rest of us eventually adopt.
In many ways, the cohort’s spending habits reflect those seen in the U.S. at large.
Teens’ self-reported annual spending is down 1% to $2,316 compared to last fall, and down 4% from the spring, according to Piper Sandler’s biannual teen survey released Tuesday. Interestingly, male teens report spending 11% more than last fall, while females are spending 8% less.
High prices appear to be weighing on teens as much as they are on other age groups in the U.S. When asked about the biggest political and social issues today, inflation was second behind the environment — the economy was fifth.
When teens are spending, 37% said they are using funds earned from a part-time job, while 62% said parents contribute to spending.
One company reigned among teen spenders. Despite a rocky financial performance recently, Nike
remains the favorite brand for apparel and footwear for both male and female teens for the 12th year running in the survey that has been conducted for 22 years. Other fashion and beauty brands have been moving around in preference during that time.
Teens are spending 4% less on clothing compared to last year, down to $563 per year. Females are outspending males by about $180, slightly less than the difference in the spring version of the survey.
After Nike, American Eagle
and Lululemon
are the second- and third-most preferred brands among teens, the same as in the spring. While Shein moved up to the No. 4 spot from No. 5, overtaking H&M, the company’s market share fell 1 percentage point. 
Teens are also putting less money into footwear. Spending dropped 3% to $305 a year. Males outspend females on shoes by about $80 a year.
Converse held the spot for the second-most favorite brand behind Nike but dropped in market share by 1 percentage point. Adidas held the No. 3 spot, and New Balance gained 2 percentage points of market share to become the fourth favorite brand. It surpassed Vans, which lost share and fell to the No. 5 spot.
Crocs and Crocs-owned Hey Dude come in at No. 6 and No. 7, respectively. On Running emerged in the top 10, claiming the No. 8 spot. Birkenstock, which is set to go public this week, did not make the top 10, and hasn’t for at least the last four surveys.
Teens are shopping more at off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx
, Ross Stores
, Marshalls and Nordstrom
Rack, as well as online. They’re buying less at specialty stores, discounters such as Target
and Walmart
, outlets and secondhand options.
Amazon dominates as the online shopping site of choice. Shein comes up second, but with just 7% of share compared to Amazon’s 59%. StockX and Temu moved into the top 10 after not making the list in the spring. Princess Polly and GOAT fell out of the top 10.
When teens were asked what the top fashion trends were in school, “leggings/Lululemon” held the top spot for females as it has for at least the last four surveys. It was followed by crop tops and jeans at No. 2 and No. 3, respectively. They rose from the No. 4 and No. 5 trend in the spring, as UGG Australia boots dropped from second-most named trend for females to sixth. “Baggy/saggy pants” were the fifth-most named trend for females.
When asked about top trends, males named “Nike/Jordans” as No. 1, as they have for at least the last four surveys. Athletic wear was second, and “baggy/saggy pants” was third for male fashion trends. Hoodies fell to fifth from second in the spring, and short shorts popped up at No. 9 as a top trend for males in school.
Teens are spending $324 a year on beauty, up 23% from last year. The jump was led by a 33% increase in cosmetics, marking the highest spending level in the category since 2019.
In cosmetics, e.l.f. remains the top makeup brand, and gained in share from the spring and last year. Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty held the No. 2 spot and gained share over last year. Maybelline held the third spot. 
Skin care spending grew 19% over last year, and CeraVe was the top skin care brand. The Ordinary, owned by Estée Lauder, comes in second and L’Oreal-owned La Roche-Posay gained two spots to land at No. 3.
Fragrance spending, meanwhile, grew 14% over last fall. Bath & Body Works
is No. 1 in the category, but its market share fell 7 percentage points from last year. Hair care spending increased 5% from last year. Olaplex was the favorite brand, though it held the lowest share seen in this survey. 
Teens are shifting where they buy beauty. Sephora unseated Ulta
as the top destination for beauty for the first time in five years. Both Sephora and Ulta have shop presences within other major retailers’ stores, at Kohl’s and Target, respectively.
Target, Amazon and Walmart make up the top five in the beauty category. T.J. Maxx made the list at No. 10 for the first time in at least the last four surveys. 
Methodology: Piper Sandler’s survey results come from answers from nearly 9,200 teens with an average age of 15.7 years old, surveyed in 49 U.S. states with an average household income of $70,725."
Annika Kim Constantino,Supreme Court declines to hear case challenging FDA rejection of flavored vapes,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear arguments in a case challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s authority to reject approvals of flavored electronic cigarettes. 
The case is one of several challenges to the FDA’s regulation of the vaping industry, which has hooked members of a new generation on nicotine, and ballooned into an $8.2 billion market in less than a decade. 
The 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in December ruled that the FDA has the power to deny applications for flavored e-cigarette products because of its mandate to protect public health by discouraging younger people from smoking.
The lower court ruling rebuffed an appeal by Avail Vapor, a vape retailer, which argues that the FDA unfairly denied its product applications based on requirements the agency “secretly” changed without notifying companies.
Avail’s attorney, Eric Heyer, told CNBC on Tuesday that the company is “disappointed that the Supreme Court declined to review the flawed process by which FDA issued its marketing denial orders to Avail without adequate prior notice of the specific longitudinal comparative efficacy study requirements the agency ultimately imposed.”
The FDA issues marketing denial orders to reject product applications.
A spokesperson for the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court’s decision.
In 2016, the FDA determined that e-cigarettes were subject to its regulation, like traditional tobacco products. E-cigarettes are handheld devices used to inhale a vapor, which usually contains nicotine, flavoring and other chemicals. 
The agency gave companies until September 2020 to submit applications for approval of each of their vape products, even if they were already on the market. 
The FDA in March said nearly seven million applications were submitted by that deadline, but the agency has rejected more than 1 million of them.
The case is related to the FDA’s 2021 decision to reject all of Avail Vapor’s applications for its fruit- and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes.
The FDA said Avail did not present long-term studies demonstrating that its sweet-flavored vapes were more effective at helping adult smokers quit than tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes.
The agency said those studies are necessary to demonstrate that the benefits of Avail’s products to adults outweigh their risks to youth. Children, teens and young adults are more attracted to e-cigarettes that mimic the taste of sweet treats, according to the FDA.
Avail’s applications included four studies that surveyed patients on the safety and usability of a few of the company’s products and e-cigarettes overall, but that research did not make any comparisons to tobacco-flavored vapes. The company also outlined its marketing measures, including age verification for online sales, designed to prevent underage use of its flavored e-cigarettes. 
Avail in its appeal to the 4th Circuit had argued that the FDA had not said it would need to see long-term studies comparing the company’s fruit and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes with tobacco-flavored vapes. 
“The FDA says Avail and other retailers should have known what they were going to be looking for. Well, virtually nobody in the industry knew,” Heyer told CNBC.
“The lack of those comparative efficacy studies was one of the main reasons why the FDA denied these applications,” he added. “The FDA had five years to communicate this to applicants and they never did. Not a single word.”
Avail also argued that the FDA was obligated to consider the marketing plan included in its applications.
But 4th Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in December that Avail “encourages us to neglect the forest for the trees” by focusing on procedural objections rather than the FDA’s mandate to “ensure that another generation of Americans does not become addicted to nicotine and tobacco products.”
Wilkinson said the FDA did not reject the applications due to their lack of specific long-term studies. He said the agency followed its mandate by requiring strong, product-specific evidence to evaluate the benefit of new e-cigarette products to adults, which Avail did not provide.
Avail exited the retail business after selling all of its 100 brick-and-mortar stores in October 2021, a month after the FDA rejected its applications.
Avail is not the only company to challenge application rejections from the FDA.
Last year, the FDA ordered Juul products off the market, saying it did not have sufficient evidence that the Juul products weren’t posing public health risks. The e-cigarette giant, which slashed nearly a third of its workforce in a bid to avoid bankruptcy, said the FDA conducted an incorrect and incomplete assessment of its data.
The FDA is conducting a secondary review of Juul’s data and has put in place a temporary reprieve that allows all of Juul’s products to stay on the market. The review is still in progress.
However, in some cases, the FDA has rescinded, or partially rescinded, rejections following the appeal process. To date, the FDA has authorized 23 tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices.
Efforts to restrict e-cigarette flavors favored by teens may have fallen flat as new brands hit the market.  E-cigarette unit sales rose nearly 47% between January 2020 and December 2022. Many popular brands of disposable e-cigarettes on the market are not FDA-approved and are illegal.
Clarification: This story was updated to reflect the nature of the FDA’s decision on Juul’s products, and that Juul items on the market remained available while the FDA reviewed its action."
